SCOTT HUGHES: All
right, so we are

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.590
ready to move to
the next lecture.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm going to record today.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.100
So if we just quickly
recap the highlights

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.890
of what we did in
our previous lecture,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.170
the goal of this lecture
was to take all the tools

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.867
that we have built and
develop a theory of gravity.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.450
So the two ingredients
to this-- first

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.299
we're going to assert that we
take a valid law of physics,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.290
something that is
well-understood in a local

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.010
Lorentz frames, which
we take corresponding

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.840
to a freely falling frame
when gravity is invoked,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.880
and we will carry it
over into a general form

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.850
by rewriting that law
in a tensorial form.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.590
The example I went
through was that if I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.980
assert that an object
is unaccelerated, then

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.570
I can normally
write that by saying

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.800
that the proper derivative
of the velocity is zero--

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.660
or if you like the
second derivative,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.550
positional on the
world line is zero--

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.093
that carries over to saying that
the parallel transport of the

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.010
of the four velocity,
along the four velocity,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.180
is equal to zero.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.870
If I require conservation,
local conservation of energy

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.390
and momentum to be asserted
in my local Lorentz

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.490
frame, my freely falling
frame in the form

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.003
that it has zero divergence
with a partial derivative,

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.420
that [? carries ?]
over in general

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.420
to zero derivative with
a covariant derivative.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.880
Our second ingredient
is to try to understand

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.090
how it is that I can build my
theory of spacetime-- excuse

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.590
me.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.670
How I can build my spacetime
given a distribution of energy,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.120
matter, and momentum.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.940
We are guided by the Newtonian
field equation, which tells me

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.830
the Laplace operator
on Newtonian

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.130
gravitational potential
is 4 pi G rho.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.510
By studying the equation of
motion for Newtonian gravity

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.800
and comparing it to the geodesic
equation in the slow motion

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.140
limit for a spacetime
that deviates just

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.960
slightly from the flat space
on a special relativity,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.259
we noted that this phi is
closely related to G00.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.560
It's precisely equal
to up to a factor of 2.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.960
It's a bit of an offset
from the negative 1

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.950
that you get in the
special relativity limit.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.380
We noted that this is
not a healthy equation

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.930
from the standpoint
of being a ten--

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.150
of formulating things
in terms of tensors,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.240
because rho is a particular
component of the stress energy

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.410
tensor.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.320
Doesn't make any sense to
have a properly covariant eq--

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.040
if we want a properly
covariant equation,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.390
it makes no sense to pick out
one component of a tensor.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.750
So we upgraded rho to T mu nu.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.080
And we looked for, noting
that two derivatives

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.320
of the potential is something
like two derivatives

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.480
of the metric, which must be
two derivatives of a curvature,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.850
we said, OK, it's got
to be a curvature tensor

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.150
on the left-hand side, and
it's got to be a two index one,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.370
and it's got to be one
that has no divergence

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.780
so that this equation respects
the local conservation

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.760
of energy and momentum.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.710
And that led us
by requiring that,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.970
in the appropriate
limit of slow motion--

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.470
well, in this case,
really it's just

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.020
sort of a weak deviation
from special relativity.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.380
By requiring this
correspondence to hold,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.522
that force, the proportionality
between my curvature tensor

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:24.980
and my stress energy
tensor will be

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.250
8 pi G. If you want to work in
units where the speed of light

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.360
is not set equal to unity,
it's 8 pi G over C to the 4th.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.860
So that's fine.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.230
This is, in fact, exactly
how Einstein originally

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.120
derived this.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.230
And it's a very physical, very--

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.270
it's a very physicist
kind of an argument.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.880
There is a another route
to the field equations,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.400
though, which I would
like to talk about

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.480
in this next lecture.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.680
And what's interesting is
that, historically, this route

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.800
was actually developed at
almost the exact same time

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.340
that Einstein developed this
way of coming up with the field

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.850
equations that are going to
describe relativistic gravity.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.620
This particular
route helps us to--

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.850
I'd say it clarifies
some of the choices that

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.490
are made that lead to
this particular framework

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.230
for the field equations.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.990
And as we'll see as we get
to the end of this lecture,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.910
it helps to illustrate
how it might

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.470
be-- if general relativity is
incomplete in some way, how

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.888
we might systematically
add a little bit

00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:39.430
of additional
framework, a little bit

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.440
of an additional structure.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.530
It gives us, what is
the most natural way

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.350
to introduce additional
degrees of freedom,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.150
additional ways of
modifying things?

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.250
So the framework I'm
going to talk about today

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.270
is something that allows us
to much more naturally move

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.840
beyond what this might
be, just in case--

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.120
Einstein, at some
point, we're going

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.490
to likely find that
general relativity is not

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.270
quite adequate.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.340
It doesn't describe
everything to the degree

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.800
that we are able to
measure everything.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.500
This will give us the
tools to go beyond that.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.120
So the particular route
I'm going to [? derive ?]

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.700
is found by varying a
particular Lagrangian.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.080
We're going to
essentially define

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.086
an action principle for the
gravitational interaction.

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:31.450
So I will call this
lecture the field equation

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:40.136
via the Einstein-Hilbert action.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.850
That is the same Hilbert of
Hilbert Spaces, David Hilbert,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.840
mathematician who was active
at about the same time

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.840
that Einstein was at his
peak research productivity.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.600
As I said, this way of
thinking about things

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.500
and this formulation that
allows us to re-derive this,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.660
it was developed
almost in parallel

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.260
to Einstein's formulation
of general relativity,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.440
so much so that they
practically overlapped.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.140
But it must be said that
Hilbert gives priority

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.130
to Einstein on this.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.760
Hilbert gave
Einstein the priority

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.350
because he felt that Einstein
really clarified the physics.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.860
And it was his insights that
led to this way of thinking

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.177
about gravity, even
though in some ways

00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:28.760
he came up with a
way of understanding

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.430
where the field equations come
from that is somewhat more

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.330
elegant.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.445
So let me first
sketch schematically

00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:35.570
how we're going to do this.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:50.470
Schematically, what we
do is we define an action

00:06:50.470 --> 00:07:03.645
as the integral of a Lagrange
density over all of spacetime.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.560
So we're going to
write our action as S,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.880
and we're going to write it as
an integral over our spacetime

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.560
coordinates of some
Lagrange density.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.630
So this is not a lot
in field theories.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.370
This Lagrange
density is something

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.290
that depends on the
fields you are studying.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.820
The action must itself
be a Lorentz scalar.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.530
If I'm working in a
freely falling frame,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.280
it cannot be something that
depends upon the particular

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.990
frame that one is using.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.955
And so one often writes this.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.850
You explicitly call
out the square root

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.120
of minus G. That is
necessary in order

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.580
to make your little
coordinate interval here

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.950
be a proper volume integral.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.760
And just to make a little bit
of a notational difference,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.930
let's call L hat the version
of the Lagrange density

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.210
that has that weighted
in there, like so.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.810
So this will, in fact, be--

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.540
so this entire integral, both
of these entire integrals,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.340
are Lorentz scalars.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.380
This is a proper
element of volume,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:38.350
and so this is a proper Lorentz
covariant well-defined Lagrange

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.650
density.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.510
So whenever you have
an action principle,

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:50.180
you proceed via an
extremization procedure.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.740
So suppose your Lagrangian--

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.532
I'm going to write this
very schematically.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:57.130
Suppose it depends on
some set of fields.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:14.310
When you extremize this, that
amounts to our requirement

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.990
that the action be
stationary with respect

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.450
to a variation of the fields.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:44.055
So if I vary my fields, I'm
going to vary my action.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.010
And let's just schematically
write this using

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.650
the first form of things here.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.600
I will then say, however,
my Lagrangian varies,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:07.970
as I vary whatever fields it
depends on, this must be zero.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.340
That is my stationarity
requirement.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.880
For this to occur, for this to
be valid for arbitrary field

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:24.648
variations, I will
then deduce from this

00:10:24.648 --> 00:10:26.690
that the variation of the
Lagrange density itself

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.440
with those fields
must be equal to zero.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.270
When I do this, this will
then lead to Euler Lagrange

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.710
equations for my fields.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.240
Now, many students in the
class may have already

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.110
seen things like this.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.610
But for those who have not, let
me work through a fairly simple

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.060
example.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.260
So let's imagine that I have
a Lagrangian that just depends

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.110
on a scalar field phi and
derivatives of that scalar

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.610
field.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.710
So L is going to
depend on some phi

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.460
and derivatives of that phi.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.130
In my notes actually, imagine
there might be multiple scalar

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.450
fields.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.742
Let's just keep it simple here.

00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:29.650
We'll just have one scalar
field and its derivatives.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.270
When we do our
variation, it's going

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.090
to be important that we treat
variations of the derivative

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.630
differently from
variations of the field.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.118
At the moment, I'm going
to focus on flat spacetime.

00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:43.660
We'll see what happens when the
spacetime's a little bit more

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.077
interesting in
just a few moments.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.740
And what I'm going
to do is imagine

00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:13.237
that phi varies like so, and its
derivative varies like so, OK?

00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:14.070
So let's apply this.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.590
I want to look at a variation
of this thing with respect

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.450
to my fields.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:25.990
So when I do my variation
of the action S,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:34.150
I get one term that will arise
in the variation in the field

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:49.500
phi, and I will get
another term that

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.500
arises due to the variation
in the derivative.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.340
That term is potentially a
little bit problematic for us.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.260
I'm going to gloss over
a couple of details.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.040
But essentially what you
want to do is, at this point,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.470
apply integration by parts.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.030
When you apply
integration by parts,

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.350
you can move this derivative
onto this term here.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:52.320
And in so doing, your delta S
becomes something like this.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.360
Caution-- I'm being a
little bit glib here.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.260
That is only true if--

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.020
when you do this properly,
there is kind of a boundary term

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.217
that I'm assuming
can be discarded.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.740
I don't want to get lost
in the weeds associated

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.615
with that right here.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:12.168
Our goal is just to sort of
sketch the main physical ideas.

00:14:12.168 --> 00:14:13.710
But I will say that
this is something

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.670
that should be treated
with a little bit of care.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.170
And I highlight
this because there's

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.070
going to be a similar step that
I'm going to sort of go over

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.120
with a little less care than I
would like as we move forward,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.970
and I'll comment on
that at that time.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.280
Having done this and
assuming that the discarding

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.040
of the boundary term
is safe for me here--

00:14:34.872 --> 00:14:36.830
actually, let me just
make one further comment.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.077
This is being done at
over all of spacetime.

00:14:40.077 --> 00:14:41.660
And so when I do
that, I'm essentially

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.370
assuming that the boundary
is the boundary of infinity,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.860
which doesn't really exist, OK?

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.260
So that's one reason why you
can generally get rid of it

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.810
in this case.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.810
And it turns out
to be fairly safe.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.663
I'm highlighting
this point because it

00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:54.080
should be stated
a little bit more

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.990
carefully than I
have it in my notes.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.293
And when we apply
this to gravity,

00:14:59.293 --> 00:15:00.710
there's a little
bit of a subtlety

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.637
there that I will
comment on at that time.

00:15:05.637 --> 00:15:07.220
For now, I'm just
going to say, great.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.960
So that sort of works good.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.860
That works out very
good, very well.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.170
And in order for this
to be equal to zero,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:22.820
the term inside my square
braces must vanish,

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:38.410
and so I wind up with Euler
Lagrange equations, which

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:44.480
my field, my field phi, must
satisfy given the Lagrangian L,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.700
OK?

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.380
Now let's just take
it one step further.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.890
So I haven't said yet where
the Lagrangian comes from, OK?

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.070
As I sort of indicated, when
I sketch this over here,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.530
it's going to depend on the
nature of the field you study.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:01.150
So it's very common when you're
studying, say, a scalar field

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.210
and flat spacetime
that you imagine

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:11.320
that your Lagrangian has what
we call a kinetic term, which

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.690
is proportional to
something that's quadratic--

00:16:17.626 --> 00:16:22.910
whoops-- in the
derivatives of your field.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.710
If it is massive, you
may have another term

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.127
which sort of looks almost like
a potential energy in which you

00:16:32.127 --> 00:16:34.460
get something that looks like
the field squared coupling

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.920
to a parameter with
the dimensions of mass.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:17:12.230
Take these derivatives,
so taking the derivative

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.390
of this Lagrangian with
respect to the field,

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.260
that's quite simple.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.260
You just get m squared phi.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:31.830
Take the derivative with respect
to the field's derivative,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.600
what pops out of this is--

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.578
pardon me.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.170
[INAUDIBLE] looks like this.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:57.580
Now, take one more derivative
this guy, pardon me.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.360
Just one second.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:58.860
Yeah.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.285
My apologies.

00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:08.660
I was just looking
over my notes.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.690
You just get the wave operator,
the flat spacetime wave

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.580
operator, acting
on the field phi.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:36.130
And the Euler Lagrange
equations give us

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.290
the following wave
equation governing

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.300
this field in flat spacetime.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.000
This is a result known as the
massive Klein Gordon equation.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.700
So that's great.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.610
How do we apply this to
our theory of gravity?

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.240
So there's two things
that we need to decide.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.293
One is, what fields am I going
to build my Lagrangian out of?

00:19:26.293 --> 00:19:28.710
And so I'm going to come back
to this point, because there

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.270
actually is a choice to
be made here, which is--

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.590
it's a little non-obvious.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.060
And I'm going to
have a brief aside

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.210
where I discuss for a moment a
slightly different way of doing

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.992
it than what I'm
going to cover here.

00:19:43.992 --> 00:19:45.450
But we're going to
vary the metric.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.825
We're going to treat the metric
as our fundamental field.

00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:50.347
And so when I write down
the Lagrangian for gravity,

00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:52.680
I'm going to imagine that
it's a function of the metric,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.347
and that would be the
thing that I vary.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.690
The other issue is, what
should I use for my Lagrangian?

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.260
So the principle which I'm going
to use to make the choice here

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.710
applies to the gravity.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.300
So my question is-- pardon me.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.150
My writing and my brain are
getting out of sync here--

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.490
how do we choose our Lagrangian?

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.540
How do we choose L?

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:42.270
So it must be a scalar,
or a scalar density

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.110
if I want to take in bearing in
mind that factor of square root

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:53.800
G, must yield a scalar action.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.800
And here's why I'm going
to make a real decision

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.300
with consequences.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.575
It must be built from
curvature tensors.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.610
The reason I choose to make it
something that is constructed

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.170
from curvature tensors is that
I want this Lagrange density

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.040
to be something that I
cannot get rid of by changing

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.720
my reference frame.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.740
If it's the metric, I can make
the metric flat at any point

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.183
simply by going into a
freely falling frame.

00:21:33.183 --> 00:21:35.350
It has something to do with
the Christoffel symbols,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.830
or rather with my connection.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.370
I can make that vanish by going
into a freely falling frame.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.810
I cannot get rid
of the curvature.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.490
So this point two here,
this second point,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:51.200
this follows because this cannot
be something that is eliminated

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.763
by changing my
frame of reference.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:17.950
I claim, based on that, that
the simplest action of all,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.770
the one that you should
at least start with,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:30.100
the one that is least ornate
and that encompasses these two

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:41.150
principles, is I'm going
to choose the L hat.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.290
in other words, the one
I'm going to separate out,

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.622
the factor of
square root minus G.

00:22:47.622 --> 00:22:55.700
I want this to be
the Ricci scalar.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.190
It's the simplest possible
thing that I can make out

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.790
of curvature tensors
that is a curvature

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.530
and is going to
give me a scalar.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.510
One could make
other choices, OK?

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.060
And in essence, that is the
reason I am doing this lecture,

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.720
is I want to highlight the
fact that this particularly

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.900
simple choice, we're going to
see it reproduces the Einstein

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.650
field equation.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.160
And so, in that sense, general
relativity, we're going to see,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.470
is really the simplest
geometric theory of gravitation.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.170
One could make more
complicated ones, OK?

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.060
But this is the simplest one.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.293
And in the last couple
minutes of this lecture,

00:23:35.293 --> 00:23:37.710
we'll sort of explore how we
can make it a little bit more

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.658
ornate.

00:23:38.658 --> 00:23:39.700
So let's begin with this.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:50.720
So I'm going to write S
equals the integral of all

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.980
these things.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.040
And let's be blunt.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.770
Because I'm allowed to cheat
because I'm the professor,

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:04.570
I'm going to throw in a proof
factor of 1 over 16 pi G, OK?

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.518
Now, I am going to regard
my curvature tensor.

00:24:08.518 --> 00:24:10.810
Like I said, I'm going to
regard this as something that

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.840
is built from the metric.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.150
So this form in which
I've written here,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.760
I'm just saying schematically
that Ricci itself

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.110
is built from the metric.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:33.580
The Ricci scalar is the
trace of the Ricci curvature.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:42.710
When I vary this thing,
what I would like

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.813
is to see what happens--

00:24:44.813 --> 00:24:46.745
whoops, forgot my integral.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:16.350
And I'm going to vary it
in the following way, OK?

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.250
let's just clean up my
indices a little bit here.

00:25:25.435 --> 00:25:26.860
I like to keep
things consistent.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.027
I'm going to confuse myself.

00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:29.200
Let's leave them like that.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.600
This is fine, OK?

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.940
So here's what I
want to evaluate.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.060
I'm going to do a
variation of these things.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.300
I'm going to assert
the variation in the--

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.550
well, I'm not going to assert.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.610
What I'm going to do
is do this variation.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.250
That will give me the
variation in the action.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.080
For this to be
stationary, I'm going

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.370
to require that
this equals zero.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:57.010
So what this tells me is I need
to work this variation of what

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.822
is in square braces out.

00:25:58.822 --> 00:26:00.280
I need to work this
out right here.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.300
All right, so this needs be done
with some care, so let's do it.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.710
First, the thing
which I'm going to be

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.370
looking at variations
of, basically, I'm

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.640
looking at a variation of--

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:58.110
I want to know how this
changes when I vary the metric.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.910
This is going to break
into three pieces.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:06.390
I'm going to want the variation
of the square root of minus

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.850
determinant of the metric.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:14.190
And then this will come
along for the ride.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.975
I'm going to want to look at--

00:27:16.975 --> 00:27:18.600
well, I'm going to
get one piece that's

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.772
just the variation
of the metric itself.

00:27:22.772 --> 00:27:24.480
Don't need to do too
much more with that.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.190
That actually already
has the factor

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.850
that I want to factor out there.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:36.870
And then I'm going
to have a term that

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:43.680
looks like what I get when I
vary my Ricci curvature, OK?

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.440
So these are the three pieces
that I need to worry about,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.280
really just two.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.320
This one's kind of trivial.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.410
This one's a little
more complicated.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:28:01.200
All right, so when I vary my
square root of minus G term,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.360
we discuss this a little
bit in a previous lecture

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.600
where I introduce some, what
I call, party tricks involving

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.430
the determinant of the metric.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:16.790
You go back and
take a look at this,

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.930
you'll see that
this can be turned

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.740
into the following
calculation, OK?

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:31.890
When you vary your Ricci tensor,
by something of a miracle,

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.200
you will discover that
this can be written

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:42.810
as a term that looks like
the derivative, should

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.660
be the difference rather, of
two covariance derivatives

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:54.705
of variations in your
Christoffel symbols, OK?

00:28:54.705 --> 00:28:56.580
Now, I like to work out
what those variations

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.560
in the Christoffel symbols are.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.460
These are a little bit lengthy.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.210
Just bear with me while
I write these out.

00:29:51.516 --> 00:29:55.280
OK, as promised, it's
a little bit lengthy.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.040
Using those two terms,
OK, using that term,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.510
setting the indices
as appropriate

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.380
and taking those covariant
derivatives, what you will then

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:20.890
find when you evaluate
the important combination

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:26.587
to give me that term that
involves my Ricci variation

00:30:26.587 --> 00:30:27.295
looks as follows.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.120
So I'm going to
take those things,

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.110
put them together to make
my delta Ricci tensor,

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.340
and then trace over it.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:52.398
And you get a lot of
cancellations when you do that,

00:30:52.398 --> 00:30:53.565
such that the final result--

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.390
Notice no free
indices on this, OK?

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:14.850
So I've got derivatives
hooking onto the Gs here.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.190
The mu nu is hooking
up to that mu nu there.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.090
And before I manipulate
this further,

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.850
I'm just going to note that
this is in the form of--

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.830
you can write this as the
divergence of some vector

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.330
field.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:45.350
So I'm going to say that this
is the divergence of VA, OK?

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.850
Excuse me.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:46.600
V alpha.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.730
V alpha is implicitly defined.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.280
It's basically this beta
covariant derivative

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.870
of all this junk here, OK?

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.550
You might think,
well, wait a minute.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.350
I'm taking derivatives
of the metric here.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.642
Why doesn't my covariant
derivative metric just give me

00:32:02.642 --> 00:32:03.380
zero?

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.172
We need to be little
bit careful about that

00:32:05.172 --> 00:32:07.640
because we are varying
the metric, OK?

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.710
And when we're
varying the metric,

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.430
once we have finished our
variational principle,

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.780
we will settle down to a
metric where that is the case.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.322
But in the middle
of the calculation,

00:32:17.322 --> 00:32:20.390
you just happy a little
bit more careful than that.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:25.150
All right, so now let's put
all these ingredients together.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:37.680
And what you wind up with,
combining all of these pieces--

00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:02.220
Oops, pardon me.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.720
Pardon me.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.265
Pardon me.

00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:05.890
Actually, let me move
to another board.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:06.988
I've run out of room.

00:33:13.593 --> 00:33:15.010
This is the length
the expression.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.228
My apologies.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.622
OK, so this becomes--

00:33:38.622 --> 00:33:40.080
make sure I have
enough room to get

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.247
the whole thing on the line.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.500
OK, so fair amount of
analysis goes into-- you

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.750
put all those pieces together.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.310
You combine them all.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.500
And our goal is
to reassemble what

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.980
I've got up there on the top
of this middle board here.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:24.861
So what this tells me
is varying the action--

00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:50.290
whoops-- leads me to an
equation of this form.

00:34:58.005 --> 00:34:59.880
OK, let's stop and look
at this for a second.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.800
So variation of
the action gives me

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.280
something it looks like the
Einstein tensor contracted

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.520
on my variation of my
metric, plus this divergence

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.400
of this goofy vector field.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.300
If that divergence of the goofy
vector field were not there,

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.660
we would be home free.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.280
Imagine we could ignore it.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.340
I would want to set
delta S equal to zero,

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.797
and that would give me
G alpha beta equals 0.

00:35:26.797 --> 00:35:28.630
Now, I haven't said
anything about a source,

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.880
so that, in fact,
gives me exactly what

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.050
I would need to develop my
Einstein field equations,

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.510
at least in the case where
there's no stress energy

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.260
tensor.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.360
In a few moments, we're going to
put a stress energy tensor back

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.900
into this.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.320
But that's sort of the first
step, that-- that first line,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.390
if I did not have
that divergence

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.880
of V, that would give me
exactly what I needed there.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.150
So how do I get rid of
that irritating divergence

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.900
of a vector field?

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:19.580
Well, in Carroll,
it's pointed out that,

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.820
because this is a
perfect divergence

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.580
and it is a proper
volume integral,

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.700
one can invoke the
divergence theorem.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.515
If you invoke the
divergence theorem,

00:36:49.515 --> 00:36:50.890
and then imagine
this integral is

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.847
being done over
all of spacetime,

00:36:52.847 --> 00:36:54.430
and you basically
say, well, I imagine

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.990
there's no boundary the same
because this covers all of time

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:03.903
and all of space, you would then
presumably lose contributions

00:37:03.903 --> 00:37:04.570
at the boundary.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:17.660
And then only the G alpha beta
equals zero term would remain.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.620
That's not a bad
physical argument.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.507
It's somewhat glib, however, OK?

00:37:29.507 --> 00:37:31.090
Carroll himself
actually noticed this.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.100
So in Carroll's
textbook, he himself

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.290
says that this is
not the rigorous way

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.340
you get rid of this, OK?

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.950
So for those of you who are
more mathematically purist,

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.720
if you're feeling dissatisfied--
but it's good on you.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.020
That is the way you
should feel about it.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.690
I as a physicist am reasonably
comfortable with this,

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.200
but I would like to do this
a little bit more rigorously.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.690
There are, in fact, two rigorous
approaches to fixing this up.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.010
One of them is, in
fact, quite beautiful.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:14.070
And it was my goal to overhaul
this lecture and present method

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.160
one that I'm about to
write down in this lecture

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.400
that I'm doing right
here, right now.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:25.980
And among the various tragedies
associated with the COVID-19

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.810
evacuation of our
campus and everything

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:31.928
moving into this online format,
a very, very minor tragedy

00:38:31.928 --> 00:38:33.720
on the scale of everything
that's going on,

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.600
is that I just do
not have the time

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.970
to assemble the
note to present what

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.890
I was hoping to present to you.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.460
I hope by the end of the
course to have enough bandwidth

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.210
that I can maybe type
some up and add them

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.950
as supplemental
notes to the course.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.043
But for now, they
are not available.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.480
So let me just describe what
I was going to present to you.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:06.487
Method one is you do what is
called the Palatini variation.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.700
When you do a
Palatini variation--

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:22.090
whoops-- you write the
metric-- excuse me.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:38.010
You write the action like so,
but you consider your Ricci

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.510
curvature to be a
function not of the metric

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.734
but a function of
the connection.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.740
Then when you do your
variational principle,

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.920
you don't just vary with
respect to the metric.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.630
You vary it with both the
metric and your connection

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.805
coefficients.

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:28.140
When you do this, if you do
the calculation correctly,

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.470
you, in fact, get both
the Einstein equation,

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.010
the Einstein-- so again,
we've not introduced a source.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.550
I'm going to talk about
source in just a moment.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.760
So the Einstein
equation with no source

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:53.410
emerges, and you find
that your connection

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.140
must be metric compatible.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.100
In other words, the
connection is such

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.960
that you are required to
have covariant derivative

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.027
of the metric equal to zero.

00:41:13.027 --> 00:41:14.860
It's actually a beautiful
little calculation

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.660
because we sort of argue that
this was going to be the case--

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.580
when we were talking
about how to define

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.372
a covariant derivative,
we noted that there

00:41:23.372 --> 00:41:25.930
are many ways to define
a transport operation.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.790
This ended up being
one that allowed us

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.480
to define parallel transport.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.750
That became something
that the physics drove us

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:36.520
to selecting as a very natural
choice for our connection.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.080
This variation
doesn't necessarily

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.850
know anything about
that, but it shows

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.190
that when you do your
variational principle, treating

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.430
metric and connection as
separate degrees of freedom,

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:49.840
that parallel transport-driven
choice of the connection which

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.350
gives us the Christoffel symbols
emerges as the outcome of that.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:59.205
Now, this is not a terribly
difficult calculation to do,

00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:01.330
but there's a lot of details
you have to get right.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.740
And I've got about a fourth
of it written up at this point

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.590
and just haven't had a chance to
get all the details completely

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:09.940
straightened out.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.847
I really hope to
have the bandwidth

00:42:11.847 --> 00:42:13.930
to finish it by the end
of the term, in which case

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:18.550
I will add it as supplemental
notes to the course.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.910
The other thing you can do--

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.360
so there's absolutely nothing
wrong with the approach

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.480
that we started doing in
which we vary the metric.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.760
And we just assume
from the outset

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.490
that my connection
arises from the metric

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:37.360
so that, the way we do it,
the connection and the metric

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.010
are not separate
degrees of freedom,

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:42.010
but the connection
arises from the metric.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.430
And that is fine.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.173
But if we do that, then when
you get down to this point,

00:42:46.173 --> 00:42:48.090
you just have to be a
little bit more careful.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:51.340
You essentially take this
argument that Carroll makes

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:57.400
and you have to just do
it with a lot more care.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:03.070
So what you need to do
is define the boundary

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.822
associated with the divergence
integral very carefully--

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.060
whoops.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.560
Associated with
divergence integral.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:48.200
In doing so, you have
to very carefully treat

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.045
the curvature on that boundary.

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.337
So we are working
in four dimensions.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:09.088
So it's a three dimensional
boundary of our 4D spacetime.

00:44:13.148 --> 00:44:14.690
You can sort of
think of the boundary

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.400
as being a particular
sort of slice

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.563
through four
dimensional space time.

00:44:18.563 --> 00:44:20.480
You pick a particular
three dimensional slice,

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.335
redefine that as the boundary
region of this integral.

00:44:23.335 --> 00:44:24.710
And that requires
us to introduce

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.130
some additional concepts.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.680
In particular, once you
pick out a particular slice

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.250
of space time, some of
the curvature associated

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:36.920
with the metric on
that slice isn't

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.560
intrinsic to the
spacetime itself,

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.530
but it's imposed
on the space time

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.410
by the manner in which
you have made that slice.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.320
Sort of in the same way
that if I have a cylinder,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.510
the surface of a cylinder
is intrinsically flat.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.030
If I put two geodesics on it
and I parallel transport them

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.870
around, they remain perfectly
parallel forever and forever

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:57.680
and forever.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.840
But it sure as
hell looks curved.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.150
But that is because I have
taken this flat surface

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.670
and I have folded it up.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.460
I have embedded it in a higher
dimensional space in such a way

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.880
that there's extrinsic curvature
that's been imposed on it.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.150
When you are carefully looking
at the boundary of a four

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.910
dimensional spacetime, you also
need to very carefully treat

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.220
the extrinsic curvature
associated with how you put

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.290
that boundary on top of things.

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:26.388
When you do this
correctly, you find

00:45:26.388 --> 00:45:28.430
you need to be a little
bit more careful with how

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:29.990
you define the Lagrangian.

00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:49.870
And when you, in fact, do
that, it actually turns out

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:53.800
you don't get that
divergence term at all.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:46:03.470
You get sort of a counter term
that cancels this guy away.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.950
So for students who are
interested in seeing this

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.350
explored and discussed
in a lot more rigor

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.530
than I am prepared
to do, this is

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:21.860
discussed in appendix E of
Robert Wald's textbook, General

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.342
Relativity.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.180
I will simply comment
that Wald's textbook

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:36.020
is one of the most mathematical
textbooks on this topic.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.650
He does everything with great
rigor and a lot of care.

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.370
And the appendices is where
he puts his particularly

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.120
high-level, grotty details.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.150
So this really is
something that is

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.670
beyond the level of where
we do a one semester

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.370
course like 8.962.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.740
So it's unfortunate it
sort of pops up here,

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.240
which is why a
textbook like Carroll

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.790
does this in a
somewhat glib way.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:02.318
I am personally a fan of
doing this Palatini variation.

00:47:02.318 --> 00:47:03.860
And so, as I've
emphasized, I'm going

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.630
to try to clean that up
and make that available.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:15.690
So what all of this
ends up telling us--

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:22.240
so let's take the
optimistic point of view

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:28.420
here that we have either
accepted the somewhat

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.610
glib argument that we
can discard that term,

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:34.510
or we sat down and we slog
through appendix E of Wald,

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.840
or we wrote up the
Palatini variation.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.540
Doing this variation in
that case then leads us

00:47:40.540 --> 00:48:04.780
to G alpha beta equals zero.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.810
This is the Einstein
equation when

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:10.950
there is no source, when the
stress energy tensor is zero.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.640
This is often called the
vacuum Einstein equation.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.500
More generally, we
should treat the action

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:33.090
that we are varying as the
Einstein-Hilbert action

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.100
plus an action
associated with matter.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:43.550
So a more general
form would be to write

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:55.510
S as the integral d4x square
root minus G R over 16 pi

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.870
G plus the Lagrangian for--

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.760
I'm just going to
say m for matter.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.050
Could be matter and fields.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:18.680
If you do that, then when
you look at your variation

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.210
and enforce that the variation
of the action equals zero,

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.640
this leads you to an
equation of the form--

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.150
that's given by this.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:59.380
And so up to a numerical
factor, which I'll write out

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.060
in just a second,
you can basically

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.210
see that this variation
of my matter Lagrangian

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.580
becomes the stress
energy tensor.

00:50:16.345 --> 00:50:17.970
In particular, if
you just look at this

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:33.940
and say, oh, I am going to
define T alpha beta as minus 2

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:46.840
divided by square root
of minus G, like this,

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.670
then the Einstein-Hilbert
variation

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:54.640
gives me exactly the
same Einstein equation

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.690
as we had before.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.270
I have a set of exercises
in the notes, which

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.990
I'm not going to go
through because they're

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.347
slightly tedious.

00:51:05.347 --> 00:51:07.680
And I think I'm going to
actually end a little bit early

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.670
here.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.880
But I want to just describe
one of the ways in which this

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.200
can be used.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:28.060
So suppose I pick as
my matter Lagrangian

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:34.180
minus one fourth
f mu nu, f mu nu,

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.440
where f mu nu is the Faraday
tensor that describes

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.760
electric and magnetic fields.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:04.050
So what I want to
do is show that,

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.590
by applying this variational
principle that I've

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.730
defined over there to this--

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.460
but this gives me exactly
the stress energy tensor

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.120
that one expects for
electromagnetic fields.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:33.250
OK, so defining my
electromagnetic action,

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:37.440
pull out the overall
factor of minus one fourth,

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.960
I integrate over my
spacetime coordinates.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.270
And then notice the
way this is set up.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:54.320
So I have f mu nu upstairs,
f mu nu downstairs.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:04.210
Let's write my f mu nu upstairs
as f alpha beta downstairs

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.980
but with enough
prefactors of the metric

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.390
to raise those indices.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.100
So I do a variation on this.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.650
And the way I'm going to do
it is I will vary the metric.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:40.140
When I do this, I will
not vary the fields, OK?

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.890
If one does variations of
those things, you can do that,

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:46.470
and you can use that to do
things like define your field

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:47.340
equations.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.800
But what I want to do is
just see how, by varying

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.830
how the metric couples
do these things,

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.250
the stress energy
tensor emerges.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:58.640
So in my notes, I go
through this calculation

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.930
with some care.

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:42.360
And what emerges at the end is
something that looks like this.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.340
And in fact, it's
not too hard to show.

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.800
Dig into something, a
textbook like Jackson,

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.050
what is in square braces
there is, in fact,

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:56.920
the standard stress
energy tensor associated

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.030
with the electromagnetic field.

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.780
So this technique, this
definition I've put in here,

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:07.130
it does work in all the
cases that we know about.

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.180
And so this
variational principal

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.973
root to the field equations--

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:21.180
so punchline is
selecting L equals

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:34.920
R yields the Einstein
field equations

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.450
upon variation of the metric.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.638
So I'll take a
sip of water here.

00:55:47.638 --> 00:55:49.680
And then the question I
want you to sort of think

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.200
of at this point is, so what?

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:02.300
I mean, it's nice that there
is a second way to do this.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.382
But did we need it?

00:56:05.382 --> 00:56:06.840
Is it really
important that we have

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.390
the second way of doing this?

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.870
Well, here I want to
come back to a comment I

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:17.150
made as I began this lecture,
which was that our guiding

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:23.360
principle for formulating
this Lagrangian

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:29.330
was that it has to be built
out of curvature tensors,

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:30.965
and it has to be a scalar.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.690
I would argue that
the Ricci scalar

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:43.130
is the simplest such
construction that does that.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:10.880
But it is not the only scalar
made from curvature tensors

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.630
that will do this.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.790
Imagine you wanted
to modify gravity,

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.290
or you wanted to come
up with a framework that

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.660
was consistent with
general relativity.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:40.340
And remember, L equals R
gives me general relativity,

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.720
gives me Einstein's
field equations.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.210
It gives me Einstein's
theory of gravity.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:51.110
Suppose I want to
modify it in a way

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.590
such that things look just
like Einstein's gravity

00:57:54.590 --> 00:58:00.440
for most of the universe,
but perhaps small differences

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:04.070
kick in when the curvature
is small in some sense that

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:05.674
will need to be characterized.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:45.690
Well, one way you could
imagine doing this

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:48.410
is by adding a correction.

00:58:48.410 --> 00:59:04.700
Suppose we try L hat equals R
minus alpha over R. That sort

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.610
of suggests that
this is going to lead

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:21.360
to corrections to the
framework of gravity

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:30.910
when the curvature scale is less
than or of order square root

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:31.410
of alpha.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.610
It's actually a work of a
couple pages of algebra.

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.060
I can take this
modified Lagrangian.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.240
I can go through exactly
this variational principles

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.470
that we spent today doing.

00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:01.390
And when I do so, I find a
new field equation coupling

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:05.425
spacetime to my sources.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:19.450
So vary the metric,
enforce stationarity

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:33.550
of the action, what you get
is a field equation that

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:34.300
looks like this.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.380
Notice, set that
coupling alpha to zero

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:27.410
and it says G alpha beta equals
8 pi newtons GT alpha beta.

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:30.560
But introduce this
little scale here,

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.990
suddenly you've got all
this other stuff emerging.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.640
This is an idea that was
proposed and explored

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.550
in a paper, if you want to
read a bit more about this,

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:46.230
by Sean Carroll et al,
published in Physical Review

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:49.770
D. It's now almost coming
up on its second decade.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:08.360
So the reason why Sean and his
collaborators developed this,

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.670
I mentioned in my
previous lecture

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:15.110
that there's observations that
have driven us to consider

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:18.260
whether there is, in fact,
a cosmological constant

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.610
contributing to the large scale
structure of our universe.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:26.300
And like good
scientists, you're always

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.060
looking for alternate
hypotheses that

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:32.060
could be tested or falsified.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.740
And so what Carroll
et al pointed out

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:41.840
was the universe's accelerated
expansion, so the behavior that

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.080
is driving us to consider the
possibility the cosmological

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.230
constant, it's coming on
very, very large scales

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:50.570
where the curvature
is quite small.

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:54.470
Laboratory and solar system and
many other astrophysical tests

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.330
of the foundations
of general relativity

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:57.800
aren't as strong there.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.740
So why not try something a
little bit out of the box?

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.250
And they said, let's think
about a theory of gravity

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.160
in which there are potentially
important modifications when

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.770
the curvature is small.

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:10.940
This is what resulted.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.390
And they showed, actually,
that by appropriately choosing

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.690
the parameter alpha,
actually, this

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.440
is a point that's worth making.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.710
Notice this is
introducing a scale, OK?

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:24.410
The theory doesn't
tell us what alpha is.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:27.380
From the standpoint of the
analysis that motivated it,

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.630
it was a phenomenological
knob that they sort of

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.510
tweaked to see whether they
could explain observations.

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.040
And indeed, they
did find that they

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.790
could get pretty good
explanation of the accelerating

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:40.670
expansion of the universe
with this modified

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:42.230
theory of gravity.

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:46.070
But all good theories
are testable.

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:47.780
They're falsifiable.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.430
They give rise to
hypotheses that you

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.050
can compare against data.

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:55.670
It turns out, if you
tune alpha to make

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.890
the expansion of
the universe work,

01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:00.290
you get the orbits of the
planets in our solar system

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:01.670
wrong.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.400
So this ended up not
being a viable theory,

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.980
but it was a pretty cool
thing to explore, OK?

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.150
And I think it serves as
a really wonderful example

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:16.460
of how, in a theory of gravity,
one formulates a hypothesis

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.690
and then tests it.

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:20.390
And then giving Sean
and his colleagues

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.243
all their due,
cheerfully accepting

01:04:22.243 --> 01:04:24.410
the falsification when it
turned out it didn't work.

01:04:26.832 --> 01:04:28.790
You know, it's a very,
very nice piece of work.

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:30.590
And I think it just
is a really good idea

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:34.160
of the power of this
action-based method

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.180
for considering modifications
to your theory of gravity, OK?

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.680
And it really
highlights the fact

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.830
that just choosing
your Lagrange density

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:46.340
as the Ricci scalar, that's
the simplest possible thing it

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:46.840
can make.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.980
And that is a sense in
which general relativity

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.820
is the simplest of all
possible relativistic theories

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.870
of gravity.

01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:55.658
Let me just give you
another example of--

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:56.825
actually, two more examples.

01:05:00.648 --> 01:05:02.690
I'm not going to go through
them in great detail,

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.760
but just sketching the
way people sometimes

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.160
imagine modifying gravity.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:21.800
So suppose I choose as
my gravitational action

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:29.340
my normal Einstein-Hilbert
term plus a term

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.570
that goes as the Ricci
curvature squared.

01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:37.950
This is something that you
might expect to become important

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.540
when the curvature is large.

01:06:06.528 --> 01:06:09.640
OK, so when R is
greater than R of order,

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.390
1 over beta, the second term,
will become more important

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:14.380
than the first term.

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.780
Again, we've introduced a scale.

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.400
There is some
theoretical prejudice

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.690
among the community that thinks
about these kinds of models

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.760
that perhaps this
scale has something

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.690
to do with where quantum
gravity effects begin to kick in

01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:35.725
and classical general
relativity must be modified.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.100
And so you can
imagine, you might

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.460
think that this beta
is on the order of,

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:44.261
when you work in units where
G and C are equal to 1,

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:45.900
H bar to the minus 1.

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:54.140
Actions like this often
emerge when you are studying--

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.580
they often show up when
you are studying theories

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.850
in which general relativity is
itself an effective theory that

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:04.392
comes about from averaging over
small scale degrees of freedom.

01:07:04.392 --> 01:07:05.100
One more example.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:25.660
What if there were, in
addition to the tensor,

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.670
the metric tensor
which describes

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.980
the geometry of space time--

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:39.720
what if the manner in which
the metric tensor coupled

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:45.200
to its source varied depending
on some additional field that

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.808
filled all of spacetime?

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:34.260
So you can imagine that your
gravitational action took

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:42.689
the usual form,
but it was modified

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:49.200
by some kind of a scalar
field that might itself depend

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.096
upon spacetime curvature, OK?

01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:56.640
And you can imagine
then supplementing this

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.000
with an action for
the scalar field,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.399
which, up to an overall constant
at least, I will write--

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:23.819
theories of this sort are
called scalar tensor series.

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:26.760
And what they
essentially amount to is

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.597
you imagine that
there is some field

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:30.180
in addition to the
metric of spacetime

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.310
which is affecting gravity.

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.102
You can almost think
of them as essentially

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:38.850
saying that the effective
gravitational constant varies

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:41.729
depending upon the strength of
the gravitational interaction.

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:47.609
So perhaps down
near a black hole

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:52.590
the Newton constant is bigger
or smaller or something than way

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:53.700
out in empty space.

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:03.310
Theories of this kind arise--

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:06.580
I should say terms of
this kind and the action--

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:15.400
quite naturally in a lot of
work in theoretical attempts

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.525
to quantize gravity,
things like that.

01:10:18.525 --> 01:10:20.650
And so people like to pay
attention to these things

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.770
and to see what kind of generic
predictions they can make.

01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:27.340
These are known as
scalar tensor theories.

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.600
And if you're interested
in seeing more about them,

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:40.772
Sean Carroll's textbook has a
full section describing them.

01:10:40.772 --> 01:10:41.980
A little bit out of date now.

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:51.860
One thing that's kind of
interesting as we sort of think

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.860
about how the subject has
evolved over the years

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.960
that I've been teaching
it is that when

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.720
you have both a tensor
component, in other words,

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.260
a spacetime metric coupling
to your stress energy

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.290
tensor and you have
a scalar field,

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:07.540
you change the
dynamics of the theory.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.870
And that ends up doing
things like changing

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:12.670
the character of
gravitational radiation

01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:14.260
that is emitted from a system.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.860
And so, very recently,
the most stringent limits

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.430
on these possible modifications
to general relativity

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:24.520
have come about from things
like LIGO observations

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.520
which have looked at
coalescences of black holes

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.110
and neutron stars.

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:32.080
And all of their
measurements are

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.840
consistent with
there being no scalar

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.268
modification to these things.

01:11:36.268 --> 01:11:37.810
And so it helps to
set limits on many

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:42.100
of these theoretical frameworks
that introduce and look

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:46.750
at modifications to
GR which are motivated

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:51.070
by certain considerations.

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:54.910
This concludes the
first half of 8.962.

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:59.620
So if I'm just going to do a
quick recap of where we are

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.060
and where we are going, where
I want you to sort of sit

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:10.660
with things right now is that
you have this arsenal which

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:15.130
basically tells you that,
given the metric of spacetime,

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.840
you can compute the
motion of bodies--

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:28.090
this is done using
by geodesics--

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:33.250
you can characterize
the curvature

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:41.900
of that spacetime which
tells you about tidal fields,

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:46.640
and you now, as of
these last two lectures,

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:54.630
know how to get this by solving
the Einstein field equation.

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:00.640
What we will do in
the remaining lectures

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.290
that I'll be recording
and distributing

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:09.060
through this course's website
is solving this equation

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.550
and exploring the properties
of these solutions.

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:16.423
And so let me just sort
of say this equation,

01:13:16.423 --> 01:13:17.840
if you go back to
think about what

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.270
goes into this-- at the
beginning of my next lecture

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:21.860
which I'll be
recording tomorrow,

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.570
we'll go through
this in some care.

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:27.230
But if you just think of this
as a partial differential

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:32.730
equation for the metric,
it is a god-awful mess, OK?

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.650
There's no nice way to put it.

01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:36.440
I mean, it's just
a horrible mess

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.840
of coupled, non-linear,
partial differential equations.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.330
We are going to look at
three ways of solving this.

01:13:55.050 --> 01:14:01.682
Method one, we will think about
a kind of weak field expansion.

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:12.330
I'm going to imagine that
the spacetime corresponding

01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:21.670
to the sources we are studying
looks like flat spacetime

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:24.190
plus a small correction.

01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:27.520
That will allow me to take
this horrible coupled,

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.840
non-linear mess
and linearize, OK?

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.910
We will lay out the principles
for doing that methodically

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:37.400
in the beginning of
the next lecture.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:47.710
Method two, we'll
see what happens

01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:48.895
when we assert a symmetry.

01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:55.730
One of the reasons why those
equations are such a mess

01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:57.770
is that, in general,
there's just

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.200
a tremendous number
of terms that

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.640
are coupling to one another, all
sorts of things tying together,

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.470
and it's just very,
very complicated.

01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:09.200
But if we imagine that
everything is, say, spherical

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.600
symmetric, then
that dramatically

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.580
reduces the number
of degrees of freedom

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:17.750
that the spacetime could have
even as a matter of principle.

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:21.020
And so we will actually
start by beginning

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.680
to explore the most
symmetric space times of all.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.200
And I will lay out
exactly what that means.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.550
And that actually turns out,
at least to within our ability

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:33.580
to observationally probe this--

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.080
that appears to describe our
universe on the largest scales.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.450
And so when we do the largest,
the most symmetric things

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:41.540
possible, that
gives us spacetimes

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:45.800
that worked very well
for describing cosmology.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.560
Making things a little bit less
symmetric but still highly,

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.370
highly symmetric, that allows
us to describe very strong field

01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:54.840
objects, things which
I'm going to call--

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.750
I'm going to just
call them stars.

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:58.670
What I really mean
by that are these

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:01.550
are objects that are just
self gravitating circle fluid

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.650
balls, OK?

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:06.290
And we will see how they can
sort of hold themselves up

01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:08.878
against their own gravity, what
their spacetime looks like.

01:16:08.878 --> 01:16:10.670
There's all sorts of
interesting properties

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:11.720
that emerge from them.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.090
And eventually we
actually find that you

01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:18.290
reach a set of configurations
where there is no--

01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:22.550
no fluid can be allowed by the--

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:23.960
let me try that sentence again.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.890
You can find configurations
such that no fluid allowable

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:32.330
by the laws of physics can
give you a stable object.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:35.060
They produce black holes.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.940
That will basically
take us, essentially,

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.400
to the end of the course, OK?

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.990
These two things have
a tremendous amount

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:43.440
of content in them.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.660
And this is where a huge
amount of the literature

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.120
on general relativity
has focused its attention

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.960
over the past several decades.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:59.730
In my last lecture or so,
I'm going to briefly describe

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:00.690
general solutions.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.720
What do you do if
there is no symmetry,

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.290
there is no weak expansion,
no weak parameter

01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:14.760
you can expand in?

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.320
You just have to deal with
the non-linear, bloody mess

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:25.020
that these equations are
and then try to solve it.

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.810
And what this will do is allow
me to explore and tell you

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:32.700
a little bit about the field
of numerical relativity, which

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.950
is what you do
when you just want

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:38.580
to solve these things with no
approximations, no assumptions

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.410
that simplify it whatsoever.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:43.740
Just take Einstein's
field equations,

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:46.380
put it into a
computer, write a code,

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.590
hit Go, and see what happens.

01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:52.305
So under the normal
schedule of things,

01:17:52.305 --> 01:17:53.680
where we would
end today would've

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.920
been right before spring break.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.100
And these lectures would start
up right after spring break.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.490
Under the system that
we are operating now,

01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:04.823
I do suggest you sort of
save this for a little while.

01:18:04.823 --> 01:18:06.740
Make sure that you
understand what is going on

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.430
with these field equations.

01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:12.600
And we will be ready to
explore the solutions,

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.200
and not just compute
these solutions

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.140
but also explore
things like motion

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.210
in them and their properties.

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:24.190
And we'll begin that process
immediately afterwards.

01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:28.490
All right, and I will
conclude this lecture here.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.450
We now revisit the exponential
random variable that we

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.060
introduced earlier and develop
some intuition about what it

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.200
represents.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.440
We do this by establishing a
memorylessness property,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.110
similar to the one that we
established earlier in the

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.190
discrete case for the
geometric PMF.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.210
Suppose that it is known that
light bulbs have a lifetime

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.820
until they burn out,
which is an

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.750
exponential random variable.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.710
You go to a store, and you are
given two choices, to buy a

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.010
new light bulb, or to buy a used
light bulb that has been

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.200
working for some time and
has not yet burned out.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.920
Which one should you take?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.610
We want to approach this
question mathematically.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.500
So let us denote by capital T
the lifetime of the bulb.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.205
So time starts at time 0, and
then at some random time that

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:57.990
we denote by capital T, the
light bulb will burn out.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.980
And we assume that this random
variable is exponential with

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.310
some given parameter lambda.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.860
In one of our earlier
calculations, we have shown

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.360
that the probability that
capital T is larger than some

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.789
value little x falls
exponentially

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.990
with that value x.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.039
We are now told that a certain
light bulb has already been

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:27.050
operating for t time units
without failing.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.860
So we know that the value of the
random variable capital T

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.770
is larger than little t.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.720
We are interested in how much
longer the light bulb will be

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.509
operating, and so we look at
capital X, which is the

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.210
remaining lifetime from the
current time until the light

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.820
bulb burns out.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.560
So capital X is this particular
random variable

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.860
here, and it is equal to capital
T minus little t.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.650
Let us now calculate the
probability that the light

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.760
bulb lasts for another
little x time units.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.880
That is, that this random
variable, capital X, is at

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.030
least as large as
some little x.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.490
That is, that the light
bulb remains alive

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.270
until time t plus x.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.990
We use the definition of
conditional probabilities to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.700
write this expression as the
probability that capital X is

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.540
bigger than little x.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.810
On the other hand, capital
X is T minus t, so we

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.860
write it this way--

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.130
T minus t is bigger than little
x, and also that T is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.829
bigger than little t, divided
by the probability of the

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.079
conditioning event.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.420
Just write this event in a
cleaner form, capital T being

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.190
larger than little t plus x and
being larger than little

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.560
t, again divided by the
probability of the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.810
conditioning event.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.510
And now notice that capital T
will be greater than little t

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.660
and also greater than little t
plus x, that is, capital T is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.810
larger than this number and this
number, if and only if it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.600
is larger than this second
number here.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.090
So in other words, the
intersection of these two

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.470
events is just this event here,
that capital T is larger

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.095
than little t plus x.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.840
Now, we can use the formula
for the probability that

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.460
capital T is larger
than something.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.810
We apply this formula, except
that instead of little x, we

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.730
have t plus x.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.950
And so here we have e to the
minus lambda t plus x divided

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.720
by the probability that capital
T is bigger than t.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.430
So we use this formula, but with
little t in the place of

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.490
little x, and we obtain e
to the minus lambda t.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.335
We have a cancellation, and
we're left with e to the minus

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:45.060
lambda x, which is a final
answer in this calculation.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.220
What do we observe here?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.800
The probability that the used
light bulb will live for

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.200
another x time units is exactly
the same as the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.290
corresponding probability that
the new light bulb will be

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.130
alive for another
x time units.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.890
So new and used light bulbs
are described by the same

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.460
probabilities, and they're
probabilistically

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.100
identical, the same.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.510
Differently said, the used light
bulb does not remember,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.070
and it is not affected by how
long it has been running.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.200
And this is the memorylessness
property of

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.985
exponential random variables.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.730
Let us now build some additional
insights on

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.950
exponential random variables.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.550
We have a formula for the
density, the PDF.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.430
And from this, we can calculate
the probability that

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.600
T lies in a small interval.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.170
For example, for a small delta,
this probability here

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.900
is going to be approximately
equal to the density of T

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:09.130
evaluated at 0 times delta,
which is lambda times e to the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.490
0, which is 1, times delta.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.610
What if we are told that the
light bulb has been alive for

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.720
t time units?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.370
What is the probability that it
burns out during the next

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.320
delta times units?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.420
Since a used but still
alive light bulb is

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.280
probabilistically identical to
a new one, this conditional

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:46.580
probability is the same as this
probability here that a

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.750
new light bulb burns out in the
next delta times units.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.900
And so this is also
approximately

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.300
equal to lambda delta.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.780
So we see that independently of
how long a light bulb has

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.610
been alive, during the next
delta time units it will have

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.806
a lambda delta probability
of failing.

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:12.220
One way of thinking about this
situation is that the time

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.915
interval is split into little
intervals of length delta.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.790
And as long as the light bulb
is alive, if it is alive at

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.920
this point, it will have
probability lambda delta of

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.500
burning out during the next
interval of length delta.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.450
This is like flipping a coin.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.820
Once every delta time steps,
there is a probability lambda

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.260
delta that there is a success
in that coin flip, where

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.470
success corresponds to having
the light bulb actually burn

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.200
down, and the exponential random
variable corresponds to

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.470
the total time elapsed until
the first success.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.340
In this sense, the exponential
random variable is a close

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.880
analog of the geometric random
variable, which was the time

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.990
until the first success in
a discrete time setting.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.040
This analogy turns out to be
the foundation behind the

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.150
Poisson process that
we will be studying

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.400
later in this course.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.499
PROFESSOR: We're
going to be talking

00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:03.530
about adiabatic approximation.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.410
It's an interesting
approximation

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.260
that we can do when
some physical parameters

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.930
of your system change slowly.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.230
And sometimes, things
don't change slowly.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.140
For example, if you
have a uniform--

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.420
a non-constant magnetic field.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.630
OK, that's spatial
variation, no time variation.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.150
But suppose you send
the particle in.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.400
The particle sees a
changing magnetic field,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.320
because it's going from one
region of low magnetic fields,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.890
say, to a region of
high magnetic field.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.510
So if the particle is
going at slow velocity,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.480
it's seeing a slowly-changing
magnetic field,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.660
even though the magnetic
field itself is not changing.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.050
So there are several
circumstances

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.490
in which slow variations
can be important.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.360
There can be cases where
the magnetic field is slowly

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.800
changing in time.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.590
You have a spin, and
the magnetic field

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.190
in which the spin is
located is slowly changing,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.430
and then you want to
know what happens.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.160
So when a physical
quantity in your system,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.310
in your Hamiltonian,
changes slowly,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.280
you would expect that
your dynamical variables,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.500
to some degree, will
change slowly as well.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.190
And they will adjust
themselves in a slow manner

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.890
to these changes.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.540
And that's all true.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.410
And we kind of expect it.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.470
But there are some
things that actually

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.660
change very slowly, not just
slowly, but very slowly.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.950
And those are things
that are adiabatic.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.180
Adiabatic changes correspond
to things that change,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.290
due to some reason, even more
slowly, perhaps, than you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.270
would have anticipated.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.810
And that's the kind
of surprising thing

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.300
that we need to understand.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.950
So we will begin with an
example in classical mechanics

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.150
to illustrate this point.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.420
And so our subject is
adiabatic approximation.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.910
And we go, then, to
classical mechanics

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.770
to get a hint of
what can happen.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.820
And a typical example
could be you're here,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.700
and you have a pendulum.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.320
And the pendulum
is going this way.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.995
But you raise up
and down your hand--

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.520
lift up and down your hand, so
that the length of the pendulum

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.180
varies.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.380
And therefore, the frequency
of oscillation varies.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.520
So this is a very
simple system, in which

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.740
you have a Hamiltonian
that depends on x and p,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.660
and a frequency that
depends on time.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.186
You've prescribed it.

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.340
It's some frequency
that depends on time.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:52.670
So here it is. p squared over
2m plus 1/2 m omega squared of t

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.285
x squared.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.440
OK, so omega is
changing in time.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.350
And x and p--

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.535
this is classical motion, so
it's all classical physics.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.750
This is going to be
classical motion.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.120
Therefore, x and p are going
to be functions of time.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.860
Well, let's see
how things change.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.630
So let's calculate what would be
the change of the Hamiltonian,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.700
or the total energy
as a function of time.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.420
Now this is a
time-dependent Hamiltonian.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.610
There's no such obvious thing
as conservation of energy.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.100
You're doing some work here
that is changing omega.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.410
So the amount of energy that
this system has will change.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.050
So time-dependent
Hamiltonian like

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.000
that, the energy of the
system changes here.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.910
So let's calculate
the change in time.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.760
So x and p change in time.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.260
And therefore, this changes
in time, x changes in time,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.190
omega changes in time, and
the energy changes in time.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.210
So let's calculate how this
energy changes in time.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.840
So what should we do?

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.680
We should do dH dx
times the rate of change

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.970
of x because H depends on x.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.990
dH dp times the
change in time of p.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.590
We use dots for
time derivatives.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.570
And then finally, we also
have to differentiate

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.650
H, with respect to time
to take into account

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.180
the variation of omega,
which is a parameter here.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.670
So all these things
must be done.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.170
And let's assume these
are functions of time

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.020
because the system is
doing physical motion.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.420
So we're trying
to investigate how

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.480
the energy changes if the
system is doing physical motion.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.240
And here is the 0-th order
result. If somebody would say,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.690
OK, the frequency is
going to change slow,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.420
then you could say,
OK, adiabatic result

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.620
is that the energy is
going to change slowly.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.670
True, but not too interesting.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.410
We're going to do better than
that, much better than that.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.000
So let's think a little more.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.910
If the motion is satisfying
the equations of motion--

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.870
this is physical motion
we're trying to understand,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.630
how the energy changes
as this particle,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.090
its doing its motion--

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.600
we can use equations of
motion of the system.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.510
These are the Hamiltonian
equations of motion that

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:32.180
say dH dp is equal to x dot.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:40.580
And dH dx is equal
to minus p dot.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.920
These are the
Hamilton's equations

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.160
of motion of
classical mechanics.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.660
It is a property of
your education at MIT

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.780
that you probably are
less familiar with those

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.520
than the quantum equivalent.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.080
So let me remind you of
the quantum equivalent.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:08.750
If you have iH
bar d dt of x, you

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:18.200
remember that by Ehrenfest, this
is xH commutator expectation

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.740
value.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.920
That's Ehrenfest theorem.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.570
And here, you also
remember that x

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:32.659
can be thought as iH bar d
dp, such in the same way as p

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.190
can be thought as
H bar over i d dx.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.110
So this commutator,
the way we compute it,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:53.760
is as iH bar d dp of
H expectation value.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.130
And that's-- cancel the iH's.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.990
And here, you've got x
dot is dH dp, the quantum

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.060
version of that.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:13.710
You have also seen
that iH bar d dt of p

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.270
is equal to expectation
value of p with H.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:27.520
And that would be H
bar over i dH dx using

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.860
that p as that derivative.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.790
And that, canceling
the H bars and noticing

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.030
you have an i and
a 1 over i here,

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.310
gives you this equation
with a minus sign.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.560
So these are
Hamilton's equations

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.930
from classical mechanics that,
in case you have not seen them,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.780
you know they're
quantum analogs.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.890
And you probably believe
that that is the case.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.870
Now, that has an important
consequence on all of this,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.590
that the first two terms
in this expression cancel,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.190
because dH dx gives
you a minus p dot.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.930
So you get minus p dot x dot.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:21.880
And from here, you get p dot x
dot, so the two terms cancel.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.490
And we get that the
dH dt is just dH dt.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.970
It's kind of nice because if
there was no explicit time

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.530
dependence in the Hamiltonian,
the energy should be conserved.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.530
And therefore, it's nice
that all that is left

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.710
is just dH dt, which we can
evaluate from the formula

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.220
up there.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.450
We just have to
differentiate omega.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:03.980
So this gives you m omega
omega dot x squared.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.420
It's a result that
is of interest.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.450
So, so far so good.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.580
The energy will change.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.460
And if omega changes slowly,
the energy will change slowly.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.880
Nothing too dramatic.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.850
We need to do better.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.150
So let's think more
precisely, what

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.230
do we mean by adiabatic change?

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:51.260
So basically, it means that
the time scale for change

00:11:51.260 --> 00:12:03.530
is much bigger than the time
scale for an oscillation

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.160
of your system.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:15.520
So this omega is going
to change in time.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.470
But now you can ask-- given an
omega there is a period, maybe

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.730
a second.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.700
So probably,
adiabatic change will

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.870
hold if the change in omega
is small over a second--

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.130
if the change in omega
maybe happens over a year,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.650
with omega being
about one second.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:45.490
So this is a little like we
had in the WKB approximation.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.820
I'll make the point here.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.480
So here is, for example, a
typical graph that one draws.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.430
Here is omega of t.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.240
And that's a constant,
then it changes a bit.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.860
And it stabilizes after a
while in some time, tau,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.800
for a finite change
in omega of t

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.400
from some initial value
to some later value.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.380
In this case, the
timescale from change, tau,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.620
should be much
bigger than the time

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.640
period of isolation,
which is 2 pi over omega

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.935
of t, which is the period.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.000
But let's be a
little more precise,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.190
like the way we did
for the WKB case.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.790
What did we have
in the WKB case?

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.360
We said that the change
in the Broglie wavelength

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.320
over the Broglie
wavelength was much smaller

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.940
than to the Broglie wavelength.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.100
Or the change in energy
over the Broglie wavelength

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.640
was much smaller than
the energy of the system.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:14.960
So here, we can say the
change in omega of t

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:28.450
over a period is much
smaller than omega of t.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.450
So how do we say that?

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.800
Here is the rate
of change of omega.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:42.800
This is, roughly, the change
in omega over a period.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.660
So rate of change in
omega-- this is the period,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:52.300
so that's, roughly, the change
in omega over a period--

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.185
must be much smaller
than omega itself.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.030
So this is 2 pi
over omega squared.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.825
d omega dt is much
smaller than 1.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.130
And we can write it
in two different ways.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:35.300
This says, actually, that
omega dot over omega squared

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.150
is much less than 1.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.960
That's one way of writing it.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.310
Forget the 2 pi.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.180
And the other way is
by saying that this

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:58.700
is d dt of 2 pi over
omega much less than 1.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.480
That's correct, because when
you differentiate 1 over omega,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.630
you get d omega dt times
1 over omega squared.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:19.230
And therefore, this is dT
period dt is much less than 1,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:25.260
which might remind you
of the WKB's d lambda dx

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.820
was much less than 1.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:33.580
This was WKB, very,
very analogous.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.100
NEEMA NASSIR: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.060
Today, we are going to continue
the discussion regarding

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.570
short-range planning
for transit agencies.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.870
And if you do not have
the set of slides,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.710
the handout from last week,
there are extra copies here.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.800
Please, you can take from here.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.640
OK.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.350
Thanks.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.310
OK.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.720
So last week we--

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.560
last Thursday, we talked
about the basic concepts

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.310
in the practice of
short-range transit planning,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.500
the level of service guidelines
and performance measures that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.300
could actually be
defined and used

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.040
for the practice,
particularly related

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.460
to excess distances,
services span, maximum load,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.140
convenience, and
comfort measures.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.460
Today, we will talk
a little bit more

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.830
about guidelines and standards
related to reliability,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.210
and then we will talk about
some of the useful performance

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.812
measures that could be
defined and measured

00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:43.020
for transit service.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.880
And then we will talk
about the actual procedure

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.530
of short-range planning for some
of the agencies from which we

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.820
have some examples.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
And then we will talk about
some of the caveats that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.900
could actually be
identified for those.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.940
So let's start with guidelines
and with the standards related

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.650
to reliability first.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.060
So in terms of reliability, as
we briefly discussed last week,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.640
most agencies have
formal procedures

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.455
for monitoring service delivery
focusing on time performance.

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.420
The on-time
performance is usually

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
considered to be zero minutes
early and up to five minutes

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.000
late.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.270
As we discussed, early arrivals
is not considered on-time.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.320
That could be because early
departures basically are not

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.040
considered on-time because
early departures could actually

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.150
have a more negative
impact on travel time.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.020
And the other possible
reason is that it's probably

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.080
early departures
are easier to avoid.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.900
When you compare later
arrivals or later departures,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.060
possible reasons
that could actually

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.580
contribute to a
late arrival could

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.360
be the vehicle getting stuck
in traffic, congestion,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.220
or due to high load and high
dwell times, which is usually

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.350
difficult to avoid.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.070
But when it comes to early
arrivals and early departures,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.520
the driver could actually slow
down in the upstream segments

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.190
to make sure that the
arrival is kind of on time.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.380
So about 2/3 of agencies--
there are different thresholds

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.010
that are defined in terms
of acceptable thresholds

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.030
for the percentage of arrivals
within this tolerance interval

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.140
from zero to five minutes late.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.180
However, the usual practice
is that about 2/3 of agencies

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.769
report on rush hour, on-time
performances of 90% and above.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.740
But in practice, this threshold
ranges between 80%, 85%,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.830
up to 90%, 98%, depending
on the mode of the service

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.100
and depending on the situation,
how the congestion level is,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.950
how the load in the network
is, if there is right of way,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.800
like separated right of way for
that transit service or not.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.150
So it is written somehow
as specific to the system,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.580
but 90% is basically the
threshold that 2/3 of agencies

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.540
basically accept.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.960
Most agencies also keep
track and keep route level

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.690
information on
passenger complaints

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.710
that could relate to
on-time or late arrivals.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.560
It could relate also
to denial to board

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.410
or to the crowding situation.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.650
They would also keep
track and keep information

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.830
on missed trips and
accidents and interruptions

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.540
and disruptions, basically.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.000
So when it comes to
reliability, there

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.570
is a need to explain this.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.210
I briefly mentioned
this last week,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.910
that the services,
the transit service

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.250
is basically classified
into two types.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.860
One is walk-up service, which
is related to higher frequency

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.890
service that is
usually schedule-free

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.800
and/or headway-based.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.650
Typically with a service
that is with headway

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.570
less than 10 minutes or some
say less than 15 minutes,

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.060
it's considered to
be walk-up service.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.390
For example, the T service
in the central area of Boston

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.960
would be considered
a walk-up service.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.150
BRT systems are
also, some of them

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.170
are schedule-free and
could be considered walk-up

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.440
or basically, headway-based.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.270
Performance measures
that are related

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.410
to reliability for walk-up
service is based on headway,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.190
and it basically measures
the regularity of headways.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.940
As opposed to service, which
is scheduled that's basically

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.190
based on published timetables
and published schedule

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.990
and delivered based on
that, basically that's

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.300
the service that is
usually for longer headway.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.230
Headway is longer than 10
minutes, 10, 15 minutes.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.170
And the performance measure
related to this service

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.980
is usually being done
or being measured

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.820
based on punctuality of
service, being late or early.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.450
So again, a trip is
considered on time

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.930
at each time point
along the route

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.020
and on the performance
window, basically.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.260
So usually, transit
agencies, for each route

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.900
they define certain
time points, which

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.760
could be major stops or
stations but usually, they

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.170
are less frequent.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.750
I mean every three
or four stops,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.940
there could be one
time point that you

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.980
measure the on-time arrivals and
on-time departures from there.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.330
You may have noticed, if
you're on a certain bus,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.100
this is my personal
experience, when I

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.670
lived in Brisbane in Australia.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.450
There were some routes
that at some time when

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.970
you see that the bus is early,
the driver could actually

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.320
really slow down
before certain points,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.010
and you could tell where
exactly the time point is

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.010
that the driver is
trying to basically make

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.010
an on-time arrival
to those time points.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.090
So arrivals are
measured at these time

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.920
points along the route.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.420
Right.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.440
So what are the actual
standards and actual tolerance

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.820
or thresholds that agencies
consider for service

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.590
reliability measures?

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.530
One example is here from MBTA.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.549
MBTA, actually for
walk-up service,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:45.700
which is the case for
most of the T service,

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.450
it allows basically
actual headway

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.620
of up to 1.5 times
the scheduled headway

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.200
at origins and at time points.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.560
And then at
destinations, it also

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.470
defines another measure that
deals with the schedule's

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.460
running time.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.710
So basically,
there are two hooks

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.060
that it kind of measures
the service based on those.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.550
One is the regularity
of service.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.530
It doesn't allow or it
wants to measure cases

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.420
where headway is longer than
expected, like 1.5 times

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.010
the scheduled headway.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.640
And the other constraint is
that the actual running time

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.840
is between 0.8 and 1.2 of
the scheduled running time.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.530
So when it comes
to actual headway,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.410
you can see that there
is no lower bound

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.940
to the actual headway.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.030
Does anyone have any comments
why there is no actual lower

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.660
bound here?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.450
Yeah, please.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.740
AUDIENCE: Lower than
scheduled headway just means

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.910
that there's more service.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.660
And if that leaves a
gap somewhere else,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.560
then that would be
record-- that would

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.567
count for over the schedule.

00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:08.400
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:08.900
Yeah.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.690
Given that the number of trips
are constant during the day,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:18.120
if you guarantee that there
is a maximum headway, then

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.620
on the other hand,
you can kind of

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.360
guarantee that headway
is not too short there.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.670
However, when it comes
to scheduled service,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:34.290
then there is constraints on
early and late departures,

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.140
basically.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:42.430
So at origins, what MBTA
considers, at origin terminus,

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.700
considers on-time departures
between zero and three

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.730
minutes, zero minutes early
and three minutes late.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.890
And then at time
points, it allows up

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.620
to seven minutes late.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.920
Does anyone have any comments
about the difference?

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:03.190
Why does it allow
less late departures

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.150
at the origin terminus?

00:11:07.348 --> 00:11:11.212
AUDIENCE: Give us control
at the intermediary terminus

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.160
[INAUDIBLE] at the terminal.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.210
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.170
That could be the case.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.960
or to put it the other
way, transit agencies,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.000
when they schedule these
trips and they schedule

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.460
these vehicles, they
allow a recovery time

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.920
between the end of one trip and
the beginning of the next trip.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.320
And that actually
is there to kind

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.390
of help with
punctuality of service,

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:51.340
and therefore, it does allow
less tolerance on delay

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.250
at the beginning.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.780
But when it goes
along the route, when

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.150
bus goes along the
route, it kind of

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.860
gets out of control
as you mentioned.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.425
There are not really good
ways and good leverages

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:12.890
to allow buffer to
the running time.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.420
And then at the
destination, it's basically,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.330
MBTA allows up to
three minutes early

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.890
and five minutes late
it should be obvious

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.840
why it allows early arrivals
to destination because it's

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.010
the last stop, and we don't need
to worry about arriving early

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.770
to the final destination.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.580
At the route level, there
is one other guideline

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.540
that, at the route level, 75%
of time points must be on time.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:49.870
So although for
the overall system,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.200
the threshold here was in
the range of 90% or 95%,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.770
or between 80%, 85%, and 95%.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:01.180
But at route level,
when you're looking

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.850
at the on-time arrivals,
it has to be larger

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.020
than 75% of the time.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.980
So what will happen
if it doesn't--

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.060
a certain route doesn't
meet this standard?

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.720
Is there any thoughts?

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.500
Oh, please.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.420
AUDIENCE: You could shift
the schedule for that segment

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.330
and republish it and add extra--

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.390
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:34.070
So you can increase,
basically, the running time

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.390
and make sure that you adjust
the schedule in a way that

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.140
can be delivered punctually.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.910
So that's what's
explained in this slide.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:53.980
So if you observe in some of the
routes the performance in terms

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.460
of punctuality is poor,
then you can take a look

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.790
at the historical data and
historical performances

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:06.850
in terms of running time,
revise the running time

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.920
from terminus to terminus
and that will actually,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.630
you can basically revise that to
be a mean of this distribution,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.020
assuming that the travel
times, the running times

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.630
are distributed normally.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.272
And go ahead, please.

00:14:24.272 --> 00:14:26.230
AUDIENCE: I mean, if it's
only a 5% probability

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.360
that this will happen
but it happens actually

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.505
a lot more than that.

00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:33.227
It's probably a result
of another factor,

00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:37.435
like drivers or vehicles
or traffic or [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:37.435 --> 00:14:38.920
constructions [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:45.960
NEEMA NASSIR: Well,
that's a good point, yeah.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.410
So there may be,
for example, you

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:55.690
know when there is shared right
of way with background traffic,

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.710
there's a lot of indeterminacy
in terms of travel time,

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.710
especially if the
roadway is congested,

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:07.020
and that could be one possible
result for unreliability

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.340
of running time.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:14.940
One possible thing that could
be done is like dedicated lanes

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.105
to the transit
and kind of trying

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:23.450
to improve the performance
and match the schedule.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.320
So that could be one other way.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.400
But what I mentioned was that if
this is the last thing that we

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.940
can do and that we
cannot basically improve

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.860
the reliability of arrivals, we
may actually allow a little bit

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.630
of buffer to the travel time.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:53.090
And that's not only by extending
the running time to a job

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.120
that we can observe,
but also, you

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.820
can adjust the recovery
time between end

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.400
of one trip to the next trip
to the chosen amount that

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:09.370
makes sure that a certain
confidence can actually

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.030
be gained in terms of on-time
performance of next trip.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:18.160
In terms of the actual
objective that TransLink

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.790
has in place for
reliability, again depending

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.020
on different modes,
TransLink defines

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:34.757
different acceptance thresholds
for given on-time definitions.

00:16:34.757 --> 00:16:36.340
And on-time definitions
could actually

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:43.000
vary as well as a level of
compliance or the acceptance

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.380
threshold.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.140
So is there any
questions about this?

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.710
Any comments?

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:04.630
So there are some more
detail measures and event

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:11.319
measures for transit service.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:15.619
It comes to variables that
are related to transit service

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.400
supply and demand side.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.569
Quantities actually
can be classified

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.089
into three different
groups, the quantities that

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.150
are related to
the service input,

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.100
quantities related
to service output,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.950
and quantities related
to service consumption.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.890
So service input is
basically the resources

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:41.068
that the transit agency is
using to produce the service.

00:17:41.068 --> 00:17:45.730
Service output is basically
measuring the produced service.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.210
And service consumption
is how this service

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.450
is being consumed and
being appreciated and being

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.160
used by the public.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:03.870
So different measures
can be defined

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.280
to measure the performance
of transit system

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.880
based on these quantities.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.280
For example, you can
look at only the vertices

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:20.420
of this triangle, like what is
the amount of labor, including

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.490
drivers and maintenance?

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.080
What is the capital cost of
the fleet and infrastructure?

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.850
What is the fuel
consumption in the system?

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.170
Or, on the other hand, you can
look at the service outputs.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.260
It would be like a
measure of the service

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:47.220
in terms of how much
service the system actually

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.100
is producing in terms of vehicle
hours or revenue hours, vehicle

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.340
miles or revenue hours, capacity
miles and service reliability.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.710
And then consumption
of service, that

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.650
is dealing with
number of passengers,

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:05.760
passenger miles, operating
revenue, and operating safety.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.940
But you can go one level up
with playing with these measures

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:19.650
and compute, for example, the
ratios of these quantities.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:24.200
So each one of these
edges basically

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.940
are dealing with the
ratio of one quantity

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:35.750
at one vertex as opposed to over
the quantity of the other one.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.020
For example, what
we are basically--

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.180
efficiency measures
are basically

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.850
dealing with how we
are doing in terms

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:49.190
of producing service as
given our available resources

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.050
or the consumed resources.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.830
The service
effectiveness basically

00:19:54.830 --> 00:20:00.800
deals with how we are doing
in terms of giving service

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.400
to public, moving public
and producing mobility

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.800
in the network over
the service that we

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.610
produce, how our service
is appreciated and used

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.870
and utilized.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.800
For example, a service that is
poorly designed, for example,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.640
like every five
minute trips overnight

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.630
from a suburb to another
suburb, it's a service,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:32.780
and it has produced vehicle
hours and vehicle miles.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.620
It has consumed resources.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.440
However, it may
not be appreciated

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.090
because it's poorly designed.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.230
So that's the kind of
the role of measures

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.050
that are related to
service effectiveness

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:51.230
to take care of quality of
design and quality of service,

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.330
basically.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:57.500
So and one other comment
about this triangle

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.210
is that the cost
efficiency measures

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:09.800
kind of dealing with the
quality of the planning

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.875
on the operational side,
operational planning.

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:16.560
How the optimization and
how the tactical decisions

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.650
are made in terms of
producing the most service out

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.430
of the existing resources.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.450
On the other hand,
the decisions that

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.530
are related to service
planning could actually

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.730
use measures that are related
to service effectiveness.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.280
So in terms of
alternative measures,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.740
like benefit and cost measures
that could be defined and used

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.110
for short-range
transit planning--

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.440
before we go into discussion
of benefits and cost

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.790
for transit system, there is one
thing that I need to mention.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.000
What's happening
in transit system

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.420
is that they are usually not
run, as you know, for profit

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.320
and that's probably one
of the main differences

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.290
between the business model of
a transit system as compared

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.890
to other regular businesses,
where they make decisions

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:20.850
based on profit and based on the
revenue over or benefit of cost

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.130
or better benefit over cost.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.160
What happens in
transit agencies is

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.050
that it can be thought as a type
of benefit over cost analysis

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.970
but the cost and benefit
is a little bit different.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:40.150
The benefit is dealing with the
public service and the amount

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:45.730
of consumer surplus
or the social welfare

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.360
that you can produce, the
mobility that you can produce.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.510
On the other hand, the
cost could actually

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:57.220
include the operating cost and
also could include the revenue.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.850
It basically can be defined as
operating cost minus revenue.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.000
So when it comes to the
financial unit of benefit

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.440
and cost, the financial
unit includes both the cost

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.190
and revenue.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.780
And then when it
comes to benefit,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.840
what's usually being used
as a measure of benefit

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.170
is the service that
is being delivered

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:28.970
in terms of the
social welfare measure

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:34.740
or the mobility that actually
is produced in the network.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.020
So once we discuss some of
these alternative measures,

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.935
it may be a little more clear.

00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:43.310
So one of the
measures that could

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:49.250
be defined and really easy
probably to define and measure

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.360
is the revenue.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.680
Like, what's the
fare box revenue?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.020
What's the total?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.810
The advantage that
this measure would have

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.400
is that it's very relevant
to financial concerns.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.060
It actually, another
advantage that it has

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.240
is that it's related
to willingness to pay

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.920
and it could be used as a
proxy of quality of service.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.810
However, the disadvantage that
could be mentioned for revenue

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.390
as a benefit measure
is that it discounts

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.050
value of reduced fare trips,
discounted trips, concession

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.420
trips.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.530
And it also has the disadvantage
that it favors higher income

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.090
passengers.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:38.550
So if we want to look
a little bit more

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.220
closely at the nature
of transit service

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.080
and what should be considered
as a benefit measure,

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.196
we need to look at
the mobility and try

00:24:47.196 --> 00:24:52.890
to measure the mobility that has
been produced for the citizen,

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.510
for the people living
in the network.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.900
So we can count the
number of passengers

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.190
who have used the system
and the advantage of this

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.330
is that it reflects the
number of people who benefit

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.490
and it basically values
each passenger equally.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.900
However, the
shortcoming of counting

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.250
only the number of
passengers is that it kind of

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.290
doesn't reflect trip length.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:27.240
Not reflecting trip
length basically kind of

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.000
ignores an important component
in mobility, which deals

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.730
with access to opportunities.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.910
Which the access to
opportunities definitely cannot

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:47.800
decrease with the
opportunities for mobility.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.930
And then the other
shortcoming is

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:54.340
that it basically
reflects on link trips

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.950
and not journeys or link trips.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.380
So you basically
double count passengers

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:06.270
who are making
transfers, although they

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.340
may be traveling
to one destination

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.980
and there's only one
opportunity at one destination

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.550
or that will be actually
one activity happening

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.020
at the destination.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.690
So one way to improve this
is to measure passenger miles

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.200
as a better proxy of
mobility in the network.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.800
It has the advantage that
it weights longer trips more

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:37.080
and it's the best reflection of
benefits related to mobility.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.680
Sorry about this.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.910
However, it's
hardest to measure.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:47.900
Does anyone have any idea,
comments about why it's hardest

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.900
to measure?

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:56.330
Why is passenger miles in the
network hardest to measure?

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.115
AUDIENCE: A lot of systems
don't have an exit.

00:26:59.115 --> 00:27:00.580
They only have an
entrance stile.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.750
NEEMA NASSIR: Exactly.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.760
So considering that we're
using the data for passenger,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.310
like from fare card
systems, many systems

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.660
do not have the
requirements of tapping

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.430
when you're exiting the system.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.390
So that's something
that is missing.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.560
So it requires some
sort of inference

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.310
of highlighting our exit
locations to be able to measure

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.680
the length of trip.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.590
However, and the
other disadvantage

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:34.180
is that it could find favor
higher income passengers.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.340
So any comments about this?

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.320
AUDIENCE: That assumes the
high-income passengers,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.803
that assumes higher income
people travel further.

00:27:42.803 --> 00:27:45.257
It's not necessarily the case.

00:27:45.257 --> 00:27:46.840
NEEMA NASSIR: Not
necessarily the case

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:54.820
but in systems where you have
distance-based fare structure,

00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:00.580
and when you basically have
the entrance and exits recorded

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:06.010
and you charge people by the
length or number of zones

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.700
that they have traveled,
that could be actually

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.350
somehow favoring higher
income passengers

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.650
because it is reasonable to
assume that higher income

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.520
people are less
sensitive to the fare

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.110
and so their decisions
are basically

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.470
kind of regardless of fare.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.080
So any comments?

00:28:35.554 --> 00:28:36.054
OK.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:44.170
So then on the cost
side, the measures that

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:49.430
are dealing with
cost, the net cost

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.900
is basically cost
of resources that

00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:00.770
are used to generate the
service minus the revenue.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:07.970
And it's usually most
directly constrained

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:12.330
because that's exactly
the amount of money

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.680
that you need to
secure for the service.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.360
The budget actually goes
directly to the net cost.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.980
So that's the advantage.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.373
However, the disadvantage is
that it's hardest to estimate.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.800
Any comments about why it
could be hardest to estimate as

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.625
compared to cost?

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:47.930
At least for designs, for the
service that is not already

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:54.500
in place, if you need
to estimate the revenue

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.420
and deduct that from cost
to generate net cost,

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.030
it would be a
challenging thing to do,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.890
to come up with estimates of
demand and predict the revenue.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.080
So that could be one
of the shortcomings

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.290
of net cost for designs.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.480
However, it may not
be that difficult when

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.690
we are dealing with
the existing service

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.350
because revenue is
basically already recorded

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.610
by the fare box system.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.210
And then cost could be
another measure less directly

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:36.170
constrained because actually,
we need to combine that

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.910
with the revenue
to realize what's

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.070
the net cost of the system?

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.160
Again, it could be
hard to estimate

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.260
but probably not as hard when
we compare it with net cost.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.118
Go ahead.

00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:51.410
AUDIENCE: What is net cost?

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:56.540
NEEMA NASSIR: Net cost is
basically cost of operation

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.710
minus the revenue from fares.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.730
And the reason that
it's tricky to measure

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.833
is that the revenue side is
probably a little difficult

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:10.815
to predict.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:21.630
So the next measure of cost
could be vehicle miles.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.260
That basically deals with
the service that is produced.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.890
It's easy to measure
because you know number

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:33.870
of trips that are delivered to
the system, and length of trips

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.380
are known.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:42.210
So vehicle miles is probably
the easiest measure to compute.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.490
But the disadvantage
is that they only

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:49.890
reflect 3% of the cost
and that's probably

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:55.095
the part that is correlated
with fuel and with depreciation

00:31:55.095 --> 00:31:59.420
of the vehicles and
with maintenance.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.680
And then it also
penalizes fast service,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:09.350
not [AUDIO OUT] traveled
fast and on time

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.270
as opposed to the
model that is basically

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:16.940
delivered in congestion
and with long delays.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.740
Another measure that is
probably a little bit more

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.120
closely reflecting our
cost is the vehicle hours.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.370
And the vehicle miles
and vehicle hours

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.290
are basically the revenue
miles and the revenue hours.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:37.106
What I mean by revenue,
that's basically the miles

00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:40.190
that these buses
and these vehicles

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.960
have been in service from
the start of their trip

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.490
to the end of the trip.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:54.960
There may be some trips,
like dead-ending trips,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.730
that the vehicle can
should go empty from one

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.930
location to another
location to the next trip,

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.120
and those miles and
those vehicle hours

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.340
are not counted here.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.180
So vehicle hours basically,
again, are easy to measure.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:17.180
And the other advantage is that
it's related to more than 50%

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.870
of bus costs.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:27.440
It basically correlates
with the fuel consumption

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.720
and with driving
and operating cost.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.530
So one of the cost
effectiveness measures

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:45.950
that MBTA uses for their system
and for their decision making

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:51.050
is basically net cost
per each passenger that

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.690
is using the system.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:59.060
And then they usually define
this on a route basis.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:05.060
So the index I here could
be net cost per passenger

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:10.449
for each route, and then it
shouldn't exceed three times

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:16.350
the system-wide net
cost per passenger.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:21.739
So this is basically going back
to the triangle that we had.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:25.010
This is one of the measures that
is dealing with resources that

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.679
are used to the
number of passengers

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.850
that are using the
service, regardless

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.080
of what the service was.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:41.310
So in terms of issues in
setting up a short-range transit

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:49.800
planning process, this slide
mentions some of these issues,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.540
starting with the
roll-off budget

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.870
constraints in the process
this could actually

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.410
be related to before budget is
set and after budget is set.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.400
Before budget is set,
there is some indeterminacy

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.520
in measuring the net
cost and basically

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.480
the budget that is requested in
the proposal for a new service

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.570
or for a change in the service.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:21.300
What's similar to any other
proposal that is usually done

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.710
is that you try to find
the minimum possible budget

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:30.740
that you're requesting for
what you're trying to deliver

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.880
and that could be
a challenging task.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.790
And then after
the budget is set,

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:39.960
given all the indeterminacy
that was involved in predicting

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:47.850
the budget, then it's the issue
of optimizing the resources

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.870
and optimizing the budget to
deliver and to gain the most

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:57.270
out of the existing resources.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.810
The other issue with--

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.810
AUDIENCE: So in this
part of the process,

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.970
I wonder if it should
be advisable to leave

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:12.450
a margin of maneuver in respect
to budget constraints normally

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.890
you would have, even if you go
for the minimum possible to get

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:21.740
85%, 80%, out of that,
for political reasons

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.870
or whatever reason there is.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.840
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:32.065
So that could actually make
the situation a little easier

00:36:32.065 --> 00:36:34.430
for people who are
involved in planning

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.440
and for the actual plans, right?

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:43.880
So what Ricardo is
mentioning is there may be

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:50.570
some buffers or some internal--

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:56.150
some buffers in the budget
and some flexibility

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.310
in the budget that
could actually

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:02.550
be allowed when you're
requesting the budget

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.850
and when you're
delivering the budget,

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.390
delivering the service
that could actually

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.700
take care of some of
the indeterminacy that

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.740
is involved in the
prediction of the budget

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.970
and prediction of the costs.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:26.500
So the next, possibly
the next issue

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.600
that is involved in the
traditional or the existing

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.630
practice for short-range
transit planning

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:41.290
is that we kind of have a set
of standards and constraints

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:45.780
that gives us lower bounds on
some of the service measures.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.900
However, these
constraints only give us

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.320
an idea of what's the
feasible solution space.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.370
It doesn't really tell us
what's the optimal design

00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:00.648
and how you can
basically optimize

00:38:00.648 --> 00:38:05.445
the allocation of resources
to improve the ridership.

00:38:05.445 --> 00:38:09.810
And that could
actually involve some

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.570
of the art of the designers
and the art of people

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.870
who are involved in
identifying opportunities

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.520
within the standards and within
the constraints and guidelines

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.400
to address the situation
and to gain the most

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.420
out of the allocated resources.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:33.880
Then again, when it comes
to design of service,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.350
there is also this issue
between the existing

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:44.515
service and proposals and
plans for additional service.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:52.030
As I mentioned last week,
the design of service

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.640
is never from scratch.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:59.500
There is always something
there for good reasons

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.490
and you may want to predict
the existing service

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.160
as much as possible
because people

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.480
are relying on the service.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:15.310
They probably have formed
their travel habits and travel

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.740
attitudes based on
the existing service.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.330
So changing these
services probably

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:29.080
need to be really careful
and thoughtful, basically.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:35.170
However, when it comes to
addition of new service,

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:40.330
we may want to make sure
that the new service

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:46.150
kind of supports the
existing service effectively

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:51.760
and with all the overlaps
and all the misconnections

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.120
are identified in advance
and taken care of.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.240
Issue that we will eventually
talk about it later

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.580
in another slide is that
some of existing practice

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.950
is dealing with short-range
transit planning decisions

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:16.720
dealing poorly
performing routes.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.750
But the optimal
design is not always

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.570
dealing with changing the
ones that are only poor,

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.070
the only ones that
are poorly performing.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.320
There may be some
changes that you

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:35.980
can do to well-performing routes
to improve the overall system

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.340
performance and the
network level performance.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.730
So is there any
questions so far?

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.134
How am I doing on time?

00:40:49.134 --> 00:40:50.902
OK.

00:40:50.902 --> 00:40:53.920
AUDIENCE: Professor Nassir, does
the cost effectiveness standard

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.537
work if they can't
compare the cost

00:40:58.537 --> 00:41:01.680
effectiveness of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.090
NEEMA NASSIR: My
sense is that it

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:12.570
has to be in a modus
specific, but yeah,

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.770
but I can take that and--

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:16.340
Yeah.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:21.980
It makes more sense to be, yeah,
because you probably cannot

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:28.100
compare the effectiveness of
a bus versus a train in terms

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.910
of operating costs
at least, right?

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:43.730
So this is the standard
process of decision

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.820
making when it comes to new
projects and new proposals,

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:53.822
service proposals, and changes
to the existing service

00:41:53.822 --> 00:41:57.170
in Toronto Transit Commission.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.740
This gives you an overview
of different tasks

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:06.170
that are basically done to
start with a set of proposals

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:12.690
and to make the decision on
which ones to be implemented

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.190
and so on and so forth.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:18.250
So if you look at the
column on the right,

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.650
it basically includes
the decision--

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.860
it deals mostly with
the decision making

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:28.400
on the new service proposals.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:35.080
First, you get some
requests from municipalities

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.920
and some suggestions
from the staff

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.370
about new service proposals.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:50.470
Then, if these proposals are
passing your system guidelines,

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.030
then there would be
two possibilities.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.290
If they are minor costs, they'd
go directly to recommendation.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.350
And if they are
major costs, then you

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.750
need to do a benefit
cost analysis,

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.600
and that basically
includes estimation

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.400
of ridership and estimation
of costs and benefits.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:15.150
And then, once you have a better
sense of benefits and costs

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:20.840
and benefit/cost
measures of the project,

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.010
then there will be a
comparative evaluation

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:28.570
of alternative designs
and alternative proposals.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.060
At this stage, there
will be another input

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.170
from changes to the
existing system that

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.010
comes into the comparative
evaluation, which we will

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.840
get to that branch in a minute.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.610
After these projects get to
the recommendation level,

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:52.590
the staff makes a
recommendation to the board,

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:57.360
and then there will be
a review and decision

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.160
about acceptance or rejections
of some of these proposals.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.680
And then there will
be an implementation

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.140
of the successful proposals.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.842
And then there will
be a probationary time

00:44:10.842 --> 00:44:16.110
to implement the successful
proposals and then to,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:21.240
after six months, it will get
back to the recommender team

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:27.510
to see if it would pass
the probationary period.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.790
On the other hand,
there is a set

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:35.420
of proposals that are made to
make changes to the existing

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.990
service and that basically
comes from two main streams--

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:45.290
one is a continuous monitoring
of ridership and loads

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.700
and the other one is the
annual route efficiency review.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.350
And from this, then
the staff actually

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.040
identify service changes
and assess the impacts

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.930
on passengers.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.260
If the impacts are
minor, it goes directly

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.940
and it becomes implemented.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.560
If impacts are major,
then these changes

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.110
become into a form of
a proposal and comes

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:16.130
to the stream of
comparative analysis

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:21.200
that would be actually compared
with new service proposals

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.071
and follow the same
procedure with that.

00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:26.570
OK.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.611
Any questions about this?

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.150
We'll actually get to
the main two streams

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:42.610
on changes to the
existing service

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.770
in the second next
slide right now.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.510
So the first slide is
dealing with basically

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:53.110
the continuous
monitoring of the system

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:58.330
that Transit Authority
or transit agency staff

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.980
regularly do.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:05.170
It's basically, the input
into this kind of process

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:09.700
involves ridership counts,
regular ridership counts,

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.750
customer communication,
customer complaint records,

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:16.930
some observations
from staff in terms

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:18.920
of the performance
of these routes

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:24.250
and for possible
adjustments that

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.790
could be done and then
from operations report.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:35.290
Then there will be a comparison
of ridership to load standards.

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.600
What we basically
discussed last week

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.290
in terms of level of
service measures related

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:48.220
to maximum load will actually
be tested for all the routes.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:54.080
And then depending
on the situation,

00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:02.320
if there is available vehicles
and budgets, then the staff

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.390
actually making their
recommendations of changing

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.280
the service, if there is
availability of vehicle

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.120
and budget, there will be
improvement in the service

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.280
and increase in
the service level.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.520
And then it will be reviewed for
recommendation, staff approval,

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.230
and implementation, and this is
a closed loop that is usually

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.210
done on a regular basis.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.720
Then there is another
process related

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.490
to the existing
service that deals

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:38.290
with yearly review of the routes
in terms of route efficiency

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.430
review.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:45.070
And basically, you kind
of consider a route

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.990
from a cost and
benefit perspective.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:53.740
And on the left, you can see new
riding counts or yearly riding

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:59.110
counts that's actually are
collected from the study year.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:05.170
And then that goes
complemented with the record

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.720
of complaints and
customer satisfaction

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.690
reports and service regularity.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:15.520
And it will be combined with
the financial performance

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.710
and basically the
measure of costs

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.230
that are spent to each route.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:28.340
And then it comes to this
joint here with reviewing

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.960
the structure of the route.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.720
Some of these
routes may be routes

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.250
with branches which actually
makes the analysis a little bit

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:41.500
more difficult,
especially design

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:46.250
of branching and alignment
of branching, making sure

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:56.070
that the frequency and the
load profiles and maximum loads

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:59.460
are actually satisfying
the standards

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.840
before and after the joints.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.490
Because as you may have
already thought about,

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:11.070
some of-- so, for example,
say Green Line here in Boston,

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.450
in the part that is--

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:26.760
for example, where
you have higher demand

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:31.780
in the central area, one
of the effective techniques

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:38.470
in design of routes is to
join some of these routes

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:42.370
into one service to avoid
additional transfers

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:48.760
and to produce connectivity
to the central area

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.250
without need of a transfer here.

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.240
However what it
actually causes is

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:01.840
that the demand that you're
collecting from lower density

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:11.240
suburbs are basically based
on given frequencies here.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.330
And you set these frequency
based on these demands.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:17.750
But when it comes
to the merge points,

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.480
the frequency will be
the combined frequency

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.850
and the demand, kind
of crowded situation

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:24.590
will be the combined situation.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:28.250
So you need to make sure that
all these standards and all

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:35.802
the guidelines are holding
for all these branches

00:50:35.802 --> 00:50:36.510
at the same time.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.210
OK.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:48.360
And then after that, let me try
to clarify this a little bit.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:54.090
For example, considering the--

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.190
similar to the
example that we made

00:50:56.190 --> 00:51:04.320
last week related to two
suburbs that are actually

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.620
using the transit service.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:20.670
So let's say suburb one, suburb
two, and this is downtown area.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:24.690
If the existing service is a
direct line between suburb one

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:30.840
to destination and
passengers from suburb two

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.730
basically walk to this
stop to get to destination,

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:43.680
then assume that the
new proposal of service

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:56.440
is basically adding one
detour here to serve this.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.730
Try to clarify
this a little bit.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:05.540
For example, considering
similar to the example

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:13.990
that we made last week
related to two suburbs that

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:21.920
are actually using the
transit service in the--

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:31.050
so let's say suburb one, suburb
two, and this is downtown area.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:35.040
If the existing service is a
direct line between suburb one

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.190
to destination and
passengers from suburb two

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:46.110
basically walk to this
stop to get to destination,

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:54.060
then assume that the
new proposal of service

00:52:54.060 --> 00:53:06.690
is basically adding one detour
here to serve this suburb

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:11.700
two on the way to destination,
then what needs to be done

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.620
is that we need to make sure
that the total generalized cost

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:19.980
that is computed for all
the passengers from suburb

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:23.460
one and suburb
two to destination

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:31.080
would be reduced after the
introduction of this detour.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.540
And then how do we compute
the total generalized cost

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.030
that is experienced
by the passengers?

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:44.320
There are some equivalent
values that are usually used.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.460
For example, for every
vehicle travel time,

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.230
you assume, one in
vehicle travel minute.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.110
And then for every
minute of waiting time,

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.900
you assume 1.5 or so.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.440
For every minute of walking
time that is required,

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.170
you consider two minutes
of in-vehicle time.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.130
That's the case
for, for example,

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:12.006
when you want to measure the
cost of walking from this area

00:54:12.006 --> 00:54:14.300
to the stop.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.550
And then the cost
of each transfer

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:24.790
is considered to be 10 minutes,
equivalent to 10 minutes.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:27.630
Is there any
questions about this?

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:34.402
AUDIENCE: So from the local
suburb [INAUDIBLE] so in case

00:54:34.402 --> 00:54:38.938
there would be
[INAUDIBLE] However,

00:54:38.938 --> 00:54:43.660
it may just be the
fact that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.460
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.260
If the service can
attract latent demand--

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:54.380
so the question was that
this condition does not

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.690
account for latent
demand, and it kind of

00:54:56.690 --> 00:55:00.710
assumes that the demand is
constant between the two

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.540
scenarios.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.330
So my impression
is that whenever

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.460
there is latent demand,
that could actually

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.342
be considered an advantage.

00:55:09.342 --> 00:55:19.120
So you can safely assume with
the existing level of demand

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:24.860
if this change or if
this new service can

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.014
reduce the total system cost?

00:55:28.014 --> 00:55:32.590
But I do not know
how they exactly

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:37.066
implement this when it
comes to demand prediction.

00:55:41.034 --> 00:55:43.030
OK.

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.230
So any other
questions about this?

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.910
You may ask where does
these numbers come from?

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:54.280
I mean, these coefficients, how
do we get these coefficients?

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.400
They may make sense.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.100
At least, to me,
actually, they're

00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.660
kind of consistent with the way
I perceive the cost of travel

00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:06.820
in different components
of trips, in vehicle time,

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.320
waiting time.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.162
Go ahead.

00:56:10.162 --> 00:56:12.632
AUDIENCE: Why is the
transfer worth more than 10?

00:56:16.315 --> 00:56:18.670
NEEMA NASSIR: That's
10 minutes considered

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:22.020
for one required transfer.

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.830
So for example,
that's the case where

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:29.090
you have direct access
between origin and destination

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:32.450
versus where you need to make
at least one transfer to get

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.460
to destination.

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:41.970
So the way these coefficients
are quantified or understood

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.300
is that if you
look at the choices

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.080
people make in terms of
paths that they choose,

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.510
given their available
path alternatives,

00:56:52.510 --> 00:57:00.150
and you can basically calibrate
these coefficients based

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:02.160
on the assumption
that passengers

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.730
try to maximize their
utility or minimize

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:08.355
their generalized cost.

00:57:13.546 --> 00:57:21.360
There is techniques involving
the theory of utility

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.720
maximization that
is usually used

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:31.530
in practice to look at
the actual observed path

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.480
choices the
passengers are making

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:39.810
and quantify these coefficients.

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:42.860
AUDIENCE: So what
if you maximize--

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.680
I mean, for that to result in
benefit for customers overall,

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.620
you would have to
increase, for example,

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:52.660
like headways or frequencies
from part of the trip,

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.650
but then go back to
previous frequency levels?

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.920
NEEMA NASSIR: You
mean, in the merging?

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.940
AUDIENCE: Here, as
part of the transfers.

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:09.950
It's only way to maximize
the benefit for customers.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:11.370
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:15.930
So the scenario that I
tried to explain here

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:21.900
was removing this
route and adding

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.990
this layout for the
route and replacing it

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:28.300
with this alternative.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:37.040
So you can keep the same
frequency before and after

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.110
and the waiting time
could be kind of the same.

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:44.370
Or you can alternatively
add additional routes

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:49.740
and improve the frequency
for other parts of the system

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:55.260
but make sure that
you're serving the demand

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.210
on the distant suburb.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.120
AUDIENCE: How do you
compensate the path right here?

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.940
NEEMA NASSIR: This one, right?

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:02.475
This part?

00:59:02.475 --> 00:59:04.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because they're
traveling a longer route.

00:59:08.209 --> 00:59:09.000
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.820
They basically-- the in-vehicle
time for these people

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.660
will be increased.

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.930
So this is the
measure like the--

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:23.850
after you implement this change,
if you want to and analyze

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:30.270
the scenario, the in-vehicle
time for traveling from--

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:41.820
it's usually IVT for S1 to
D for after will be greater

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:47.810
than IVT for S1 to D, right?

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:52.190
So in-vehicle time
will be increased.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.850
However, what's going
to change for passengers

00:59:55.850 --> 01:00:01.520
who are traveling from S2
to D, the walking distance

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:08.700
is going to decrease, which
has a coefficient of two.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.320
The in-vehicle time
may increase somehow

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.830
because they are boarding
now at this point,

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:18.830
but depending on what
frequencies you're designing,

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:23.900
you can compute the waiting time
and put that into consideration

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.130
and into computations.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.090
So how are we doing on time?

01:00:34.978 --> 01:00:35.478
OK.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:46.560
So Toronto financial
standards and comparisons--

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.630
basically, service
change proposals

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:54.160
are evaluated according to
customers gained or lost

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.180
per dollar spent or saved.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:02.130
Again, the benefit that
is imagined for transit

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.470
is in terms of the
number of customers,

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:07.440
the number of passengers
that are added and are

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.480
using and benefiting
from the service.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.500
And the cost side is
basically the net cost,

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.870
like the operating
cost minus the revenue.

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:22.440
And Toronto applies this
for new service proposals

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.685
and possible reduction to the
service and to fare changes.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:33.540
Again, the financial
unit actually

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.650
that goes into
these computations

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:41.750
is the net cost, operating
cost minus the revenue.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.840
And the threshold that
is used by Toronto

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:51.530
is 0.23 as the
standard threshold,

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:55.700
that's 0.23 passengers
per dollar spent.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.220
So for each dollar
that you're spending

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:05.490
on the operation
minus the revenue,

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:10.700
you need to guarantee at least
point 0.23 passengers are

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.135
basically getting served.

01:02:12.135 --> 01:02:14.422
AUDIENCE: That's operating
dollars and passengers.

01:02:17.954 --> 01:02:19.862
It's not a capital expense.

01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:20.932
It's operating.

01:02:20.932 --> 01:02:22.140
NEEMA NASSIR: It's operating.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:26.760
Yeah, I think it's operating
cost minus the revenue,

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.820
probably, right.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:34.200
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.670
And then services that are
operating below this level,

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:43.761
we actually get kind of reviewed
in the annual yearly review

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:44.260
process.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:52.910
Again, in terms of
service change process,

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:57.220
major service changes are
evaluated twice per year.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:04.410
They're basically ranked
in the comparative analysis

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:09.925
and based on their performance
and based on productivity

01:03:09.925 --> 01:03:11.280
of the existing service.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:17.710
There is a board in
the Transit Agency

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.900
that makes these decisions.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:29.020
Usually, they invite people
from metropolitan transportation

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:34.930
planning agencies too or higher
level governmental agencies.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.360
So these boards basically
review the recommendations

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.020
from the staff
and make decisions

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.620
based on their merits.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.220
The guiding principles
for TransLink

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.070
for Vancouver in service
optimization program,

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:56.410
is to maintain basic service
for transit-dependent customers,

01:03:56.410 --> 01:04:01.990
like what we discussed
about the existing service

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:04.870
and how passengers may
actually be dependent.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:06.250
And we need to be
careful when we

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.650
want to remove some of
the existing service

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:12.310
and maintain service that
are strategic for network

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:14.290
connectivity.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.150
Sometimes it becomes
a little tricky

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:21.460
when we look at the routes
individually and do not

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.970
consider their role
and their functionality

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:28.420
in the performance
at the network level.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.020
So the guiding
principles of TransLink

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.250
kind of enforce
this concentration.

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:39.880
And then minimize service
reductions in area

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.820
with no transit alternatives,
supporting growing market

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:50.020
where productivity is
improving, reinvest in service

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.270
to generate higher
revenue ridership,

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:57.520
and reinvest in service that
supports long-term goals

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.820
and objectives of TransLink.

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:06.400
So let's open a discussion
now for a few minutes in terms

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.930
of possible critiques
and possible caveats

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:18.460
of the existing practice
for short-range planning.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:24.490
Let's start-- does anyone have
any comments or any thoughts

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:32.490
about the existing
caveats or critiques yet?

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:33.540
AUDIENCE: Slide 36.

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.390
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah,
it is actually.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:40.040
AUDIENCE: Where it says the TTC
value is, the financial impact

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.125
of service changes.

01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:43.750
Any service change
proposal is evaluated

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.940
according to customers gained or
lost per dollar spent or saved.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.670
Does not mean that
they could eliminate

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:53.210
any stops, for example,
and not lose any customers?

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:55.740
They'd just make those
customers walk further

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.735
and make service less
convenient for them,

01:05:57.735 --> 01:06:00.730
that that would be a
sound decision according

01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:03.800
to these criteria?

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.260
NEEMA NASSIR: So yeah.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:12.080
So do you mean, if you're
making some changes that reduces

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.510
the actual number of customers--

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:17.600
AUDIENCE: Say they make a change
and they don't lose customers

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.156
but service is
worse for customers.

01:06:21.156 --> 01:06:22.910
The customers have
no other options,

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.858
so they continue using
the service, even

01:06:24.858 --> 01:06:26.560
thought it's slightly worse.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.617
NEEMA NASSIR: So yeah,
that's a good point.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:29.450
That's a good point.

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:33.320
So probably the
important caveats

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.960
is that many of these
guidelines and standards

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.540
are not from the
passenger's perspective.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.680
So passenger's perspective
performance measures

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.080
and passenger's
perspective perceptions

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.190
of the quality of
service is something

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.377
that probably should
be incorporated

01:06:51.377 --> 01:06:52.460
in some of these measures.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.380
AUDIENCE: Isn't it some of the
checks and balances in place

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.280
because it's relatively
easy in services

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:12.056
neutral users of these
services lean on it

01:07:12.056 --> 01:07:14.170
and some people have
to walk further.

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:18.140
So that in itself would lead
to a reduction in the number

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.630
of people who take the route.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:23.540
So for example, from suburb
S1, the number of people

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:29.920
who [INAUDIBLE] So analysis
at route level, because then

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.220
it might actually go
in favor of the agency.

01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:36.110
NEEMA NASSIR: So exactly.

01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:39.200
So analysis at the
network level should

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.150
be something that
probably better captured

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:45.630
by these guidelines.

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:51.830
And one of the other things that
is not actually included here

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:54.550
is the actual objective
of transit agency, which

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:58.520
is improvement and increase
of the ridership, which

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:04.190
is not explicitly tied to any
of the existing guidelines.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:08.180
That's something that could
be identified thinking of it

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:14.120
as an optimization problem as
an optimal or objective function

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.649
to be optimized over the
solution of space, which

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:19.460
is the guidelines,
existing guidelines

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.460
and standards in the service.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.840
So what this guideline
that we discussed

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.890
here is just the bound
on what is acceptable

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:32.700
and what's not acceptable.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.649
But the fact that is this going
to be beneficial to the system

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:37.640
or not?

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.540
That's something that requires
better analysis of the plan

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.680
basically.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.960
So any others?

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.154
OK.

01:08:51.154 --> 01:08:53.409
AUDIENCE: Comment
on just one thing.

01:08:53.409 --> 01:08:56.810
Is this less for the short
term service planning

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:59.050
and the problem with
short-term planning

01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:02.212
often a lot of the
demand and [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:02.212 --> 01:09:04.080
will be contemplate.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.399
Whenever you do major
additions, extensions,

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.130
or you have a
major budget crisis

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:12.720
and it's a cut off
service, that would not

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.850
be considered entirely
a short-term thing

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:19.622
but more of a bigger impact.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:23.735
So the study would be
required with demand more.

01:09:23.735 --> 01:09:24.651
NEEMA NASSIR: Correct.

01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:27.020
Exactly.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:35.029
OK so in the last slide there
is a list of possible caveats

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.170
that are mentioned here.

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.750
Couple of those we
already discussed.

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:43.130
Focus of the existing practice
is on poorly-performing routes,

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:45.710
whereas it does not
necessarily have

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:49.430
to be a poorly-performing
route that has the potential

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:54.380
to be improved to improve the
performance of the system.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.375
There is data limitation
both on type and quality.

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:02.990
We observed that in
many of the measurements

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:05.340
and in many of the
decision making,

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.890
there is lots of
uncertainty that

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:11.610
is related to quality of
data and limitations of data.

01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:14.180
So hopefully, with
the new generations

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.250
of passively-collected data
that are nowadays introduced,

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:25.460
there will be improvement
in the existing practice

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:28.520
to take advantage of that
data and improve the planning

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.080
process.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.000
Again, measures not always
closely tied to objectives.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.700
That's something that
is relevant to what

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:44.570
Adishak mentioned in terms
of some of these measures

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:48.470
are basically just
constraints and lower bound

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:51.920
and they're not necessarily
tied to the objective, which

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.780
is improvement of mobility
and improvement, increase

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.910
of ridership.

01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:02.090
And then focus on
individual routes

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:06.725
may actually not be
ideal because kind of it

01:11:06.725 --> 01:11:10.010
ignores the network level
functionality of routes.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.360
So any questions about this?

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.350
Any additional
comments in terms of--

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.390
right.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:24.260
OK.

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.320
Yeah, please.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.470
AUDIENCE: So the idea of
utility is not always something

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:33.796
that someone actually
calculates for when

01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:38.510
they're considering
these simulations

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:42.348
or calculations or changes.

01:11:42.348 --> 01:11:46.300
It's kind of theoretical.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.060
If we do this then
it will affect us

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:53.927
but there isn't necessarily
a quantitative way.

01:11:53.927 --> 01:11:54.760
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:00.700
The utility itself is a random
and unknown quantity, right?

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.530
There's a random
component to it.

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:05.470
But the marginal
rate of substitutions

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:10.560
of these coefficients related
to different components,

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.390
that's something that
can be quantified.

01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:15.720
For example, what
is the disutility

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.740
of waiting time as
compared to the disutility

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.970
of in-vehicle time.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:27.228
So that's a way kind of have a
sense of the generalized cost.

01:12:27.228 --> 01:12:30.216
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
also use a dollar proxy

01:12:30.216 --> 01:12:35.590
to say that the economy is
stimulated in x, y, and z?

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:38.724
Is that another way
of looking at it?

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:48.480
NEEMA NASSIR: I think the--

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.680
yeah, I'm not sure about--

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.896
AUDIENCE: It's typically
used for capital investments.

01:12:53.896 --> 01:12:55.270
All these people
that are looking

01:12:55.270 --> 01:13:00.010
for short-term funds, things
like environmental impacts

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:05.580
and economic welfare at a large
scale are equally the methods.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.690
You are considering a
minor extension or increase

01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:13.440
in service with
the same alignment.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:20.452
So you're probably not going
to do a fully [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:20.452 --> 01:13:22.380
gradual marginal change.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.280
But in a bigger context
then, yes, you would have,

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.990
a four-step model and
you would look at CO2

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:31.550
and look at many other things.

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:34.730
And one example of that
would be the recent example

01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:42.270
of London Crossrail, where
a lot of the business

01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:50.750
case for Crossrail had to do
with deliberation and things

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:55.360
like this, not necessarily the
time that people were saving.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.185
AUDIENCE: When we say
poorly-performing routes,

01:14:03.185 --> 01:14:09.490
are we talking only in terms
of timing, for example,

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:12.640
or are we also talking
about poorly-performing

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.887
in terms of financial
return of the route?

01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:17.720
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.270
Right.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.270
AUDIENCE: I'm afraid that
for example, if people

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:30.926
talk about financially,
certain routes might get closed

01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:35.347
for low demand, and then
you have the equity problem

01:14:35.347 --> 01:14:36.680
that we talked about over there.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.250
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.770
Yeah.

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:43.340
So I believe when
you're evaluating

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:46.280
the quality of
these routes, we can

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.340
use all the existing
criteria that we mentioned.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.090
For example, the criteria
that is related to access,

01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:56.870
the criteria that is related
to span of the service, access

01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:00.470
over time and space,
and then measures

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:04.100
that are dealing with the
productivity of the route

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.760
and the financial aspects.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:14.300
So my guess is that
this is probably

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.940
kind of when we're
evaluating the routes,

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.060
we are taking into
account the equity issue

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:24.800
and the access issue and all
those sorts of guidelines

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.450
that we discussed last
week into consideration.

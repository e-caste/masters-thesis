00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.090
When a wheel is rolling without
slipping, as we saw before,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.690
that the contact point
here, the contact point

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.380
is instantaneously at rest.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.880
Now, if the wheel is rolling
on a surface with friction,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.550
then it's possible that we may
have a static friction force.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.800
So there could be
static friction may act.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.990
However, static
fiction is always

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.430
depends on the circumstances.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.340
Now let's just
consider two cases.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.330
Suppose here's a wheel, Vcm.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.560
This is a horizontal surface.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.280
And in that case,
the static friction,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.470
if the wheel is rolling
with velocity V,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.280
in this case f static is 0.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.350
And because of
that, the wheel will

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.090
roll without any friction,
which is an idealization.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.300
There's other types of friction
called rolling resistance, air

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.880
resistance, et cetera, which
will slow the wheel down.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.660
But in a perfect hard wheel,
idealized wheel in a vacuum,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.460
it will keep on rolling.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.230
However, if a wheel is
going down an incline plane

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.610
and it wants to maintain
the rolling without slipping

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.390
condition--

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.710
so here we have Vcm.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.180
And it has some angular speed--

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.870
we have to be careful
because in this case

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.940
if we differentiate
Acm is our alpha.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.750
So what is making the
wheel spin faster?

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.700
It has a non-zero,
angular acceleration.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.540
And if we looked at the
forces acting on the wheel,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.230
then we have a normal force.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.009
We have gravity acting
at the center of mass.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.300
And we also have
static friction.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.340
And it's precisely
the static friction

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.460
that is producing a torque
about the center of mass.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.300
And that torque about
the center of mass

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.790
will produce an
angular acceleration.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.450
So in order for the
wheel to continue

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.550
rolling without
slipping, it must

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.410
have both a linear
acceleration, which

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.295
comes from gravitational
force component going down

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:57.320
an inclined plane minus
the friction plus the alpha

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.750
is coming from the torque.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.970
And so this side, if
we wrote it as a vector

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.060
equation, the torque
about the center of mass

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.300
would be the vector from--

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.770
let's right this
is r cm to where

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.170
the static friction is acting.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.050
So that's the vector r cm
F static cross f static.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.490
So in this case, f
static is non-zero.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.540
So there are many circumstances
in which static friction can

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.060
vary between a zero value,
some possible value,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.829
and some maximum value.

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.650
And here we see
one more example.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.880
In order for the wheel to
continue to accelerate down

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.310
the inclined plane and
roll without slipping

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.340
that the static friction
must produce a torque

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.160
that causes the
angular acceleration.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280
And so we see that
static friction

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.447
depends on the other
constraints in the problem.

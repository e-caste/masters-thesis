00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:22.070
PROFESSOR: Today what
we're going to do

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.661
is finish off our discussion
about oscillators.

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:29.160
In particular, we're going to
talk about alternative designs

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.200
for oscillators.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.650
So rather than having
these loops that

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.670
are purely composed of
negative interactions,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.320
negative feedback,
instead we're going

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920
to talk about cases where you
have both positive and negative

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.130
interactions.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.155
So in using this kind of
combined network structure,

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.030
you can generate what
are known as relaxation

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.010
oscillators, which have some
really wonderful properties.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.860
In particular you can get
more robust oscillations,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.130
relative to the parameters.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.350
But also the oscillations
become tunable,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.071
i.e. you can change
the frequency,

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:02.070
without compromising, for
example, the amplitude

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.280
of the oscillations.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.670
So for both natural and
synthetic oscillators

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.220
these so-called
synthetic oscillators

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.614
are perhaps the way to go.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:13.030
And then we're
going to transition

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.410
to more of the global structure
of some these networks

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.560
in the context of transcription
networks within cells.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.810
And discuss this paper
that you guys just

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.290
read, the Barabasi paper, which
is one of the world's most

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.470
cited papers, I think.

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:34.410
And then after thinking about
this global structure, of how

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.701
you might be able to generate
these so-called power law

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:38.870
structures, we're going
to look a little bit more

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.681
in detail to try to understand
something about these network

00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:42.180
motifs.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510
We've already talked
about them a little bit

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.200
in the context of
auto regulatory loops,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.360
but now we'll talk about
them in a little bit more

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.480
generality, in particular in the
context of feed forward loops.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.390
And then on Thursday
we will get into some

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.220
of the possible beneficial
features of feed forward loops.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.730
On Thursday we talked
about the repressilator.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.930
So if you have x
inhibiting y inhibiting z

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.860
coming back and
inhibiting x, that it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.880
reasonable to expect that it
might generate oscillations.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.380
And indeed in the Elowitz
paper that we read,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.610
such a synthetic circuit did
indeed generate oscillations,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.460
but there were perhaps a
few problems there, right?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.740
So one is that only
about 40% of the cells

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:38.260
actually oscillated,
who knows why not.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.880
But also there
were other problems

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.620
that the oscillations
seemed rather noisy,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.080
there was relatively
rapid desyncronization.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.125
Moreover, if you go and you
ask, well is it possible,

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:55.380
or how easy would be to change
the period of the oscillations

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.000
just by changing something
like the degradation rate, what

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.970
you'll find is that the
oscillations are not

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.700
very tunable.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.500
So I'll say the period, or the
frequency, is not very tunable,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.190
and indeed this is a general
feature of oscillatory networks

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.390
that have purely
negative interactions.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.440
We talked about a couple of
these cases, for example,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.327
you can get oscillations just
with negative auto regulation.

00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:27.660
And what is it that's necessary?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.040
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.200
AUDIENCE: High coordination.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.408
PROFESSOR: High coordination?

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:37.584
You me-- oh you're--

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.833
PROFESSOR: Cooperativity in
the repression, that I think

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:43.295
is necessary, but is it
going to be sufficient?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.050
Even in this case where I just
have, let's say that I say,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.050
x dot the rate of production,
if this thing is just

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.240
as a function of x, the
sharpest it could be,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.122
this is infinite cooperatively,
so it's maximal expression.

00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:02.580
And then when you get above
some x critical all of a sudden

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.500
you fully repress.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.120
If I just have this
be the formula--

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.470
did you guys understand
what I'm referring to here?

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.690
What would this generate?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.410
Would this generate
oscillations?

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.839
So it actually doesn't.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.120
In the simple equation,
where if we have x dot

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.280
is equal to this function.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.310
So I guess this
is a theta, I want

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.450
to make sure I get this
x, less than x critical,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.240
that's what this means.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.100
So with some [INAUDIBLE] rate
beta, minus some alpha x.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.070
Does this thing oscillate?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.690
No, and we had a simple argument
for why did not oscillate,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.190
as well.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.620
Yes?

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.660
Yell it out somebody, I'm sure
somebody was here on Thursday.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.013
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:59.301
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:00.300
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.560
So this is just--
This is just an x dot,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.370
there's no x double
dot, so that means

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.020
the derivative of
x, the single value

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.190
is a function of x,
that means that we

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.450
can't get any oscillation here.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.930
And then remember we analyzed
this model where we explicitly

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.890
included the mRNA, so then
we just had that x comes,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.580
and what it does,
is it represses

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.390
expression of this mRNA for x,
and then this mRNA comes back

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.350
and makes x.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.140
Right?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.880
And in this model,
was this sufficient?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.880
Did this give oscillations?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.610
No, so this also here,
there was no oscillations.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.360
Again here, there
were no oscillations.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.744
But I did tell you that
you could do something more

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:50.160
to get oscillations, just with
a single protein repressing

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.660
itself.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.940
So you need more delays.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.410
So if you add delays, then it's
possible to get oscillations.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.680
So those delays could be in
the form of having a model

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.280
where you explicitly take into
account that first mRNA is

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.310
made, and then
that goes, and then

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.150
you translate that
to make some monomer,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.860
and then the monomer
has to maybe fold,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.680
and then the folded
protein maybe

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.790
has to dimerize in order
to do a repression.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.409
So if you have a more detailed
mechanistic model, that

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.450
includes all these steps,
that kind of introduces

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.550
some sort of delay,
that in principle

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.470
can lead to oscillations
in such a circuit.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.880
Or if you wanted to, you could
just explicitly put in a delay.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.760
So you could say
that x dot, instead

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.210
being a function of x,
instead what you can do,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.470
is you could say, well its
actually a function of x

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.410
at some time, t minus tao.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.710
So instead of having the
rate of production of x

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.774
be a function of x, at
that moment in time,

00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:57.190
instead it could be a function
of x at some previous time.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.231
Doing that, that's a very
explicit form of delay.

00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:01.900
And that can also be used
to generate oscillations

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.390
in a simple negative
auto regulatory loop.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.670
These are all different
kind of approaches

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:18.600
for encoding delays into a
model and in various approaches

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.786
will give you oscillations.

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:21.285
Yes?

00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:22.993
AUDIENCE: Question
for the repressilator,

00:07:22.993 --> 00:07:25.494
when you say the
period is not tunable,

00:07:25.494 --> 00:07:29.810
it's because the mRNA lifeline
is very difficult to--

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.950
PROFESSOR: All
right, when we say--

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.367
AUDIENCE: --in the
model you can--

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:34.575
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:36.270
In the model you can,
in principle-- So

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.432
what I mean when I say this is
that in this class of model,

00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:43.640
so you could also have,
instead of this repressilator

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.450
with three, you have the
so-called pentalator,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.400
where you have five proteins
and each is repressing itself.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.530
So these all have
similar features,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.480
so all have these odd numbers
of proteins going around

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.860
and repressing one another.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.950
And so you can write down the
model with seven, if you want.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.600
But in all these cases,
it's not tunable.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.320
What we mean by that is that,
when you tune the frequency,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.380
you in general lose the
amplitude of the oscillation.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.050
So the amplitude will go down.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.360
There was a very
nice paper that was

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.780
written in 2008 on
this topic, written

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.260
by Jim Ferrell at Stanford.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.160
So I just want to mention this.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.230
So its Ferrell,
at Stanford, this

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:41.600
is a paper in Science
2008, and it's

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.680
called Robust Tunable
Biological Oscillations

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.870
from Interlinked Positive
and Negative Feedback Loops.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.480
So nice title, I like
titles that say something.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.860
So it's sort of the
ultimate short version

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.910
of an abstract, right, if
you can do it I recommend it.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.950
Incidentally in
graduate school, I once

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.170
wrote a paper with four words,
short words, DNA over-winds

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.040
when stretched.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.880
Nice statement,
you may or may not

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.340
actually know what
I mean by that,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.580
but it's a nice short,
title, it's a statement.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.830
I encourage you to
think about that when

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.110
you're writing your papers.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.650
So he wrote this paper where,
he said, all right, well,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.100
oscillations are
really important.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.810
Thinking about context of
heart rhythms, or cell cycle,

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.052
or this or that.

00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:32.760
Oscillations are
important, but if you go

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.110
and you look at
the circuits that

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.060
are generating
oscillations in biology,

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.580
they often have so-called
interlinked positive

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.790
and negative feedback loops.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.930
There are many cases
where you have,

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.460
some x that actually
is positively,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.410
it's kind of activating itself.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.110
And this is very much
something that will not lead

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.580
to oscillations on its own.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.050
It might be bistable,
which is interesting,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.880
but not oscillations on its own.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.240
But then there's also
maybe a negative feedback

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.030
loop through another protein.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.670
And the idea is that
this one somehow

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.540
operates-- this one's
fast, and this one's slow.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.329
And the key feature of
these relaxation oscillators

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:19.495
is they are two time scales.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.680
And it's the slow
time scale that

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.780
specifies the period
of the oscillation,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.220
and this fast one kind
of locks the system

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.770
into these alternative states.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.490
And this helps
maintain the amplitude,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.340
because it has this nature
being bistable, right,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.290
so it's on or off.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.440
So this helps you
maintain amplitude,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.580
so this is kind of in
charge of amplitude,

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.220
and this one over here is
in charge of the period.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.740
So what you can imagine that
by changing this time scale,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.650
you change the period
of the oscillation,

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:05.600
whereas this loop allows you
to maintain the amplitude.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.340
And what Jim's group did
computationally in this paper,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.810
is they analyzed many
different circuit designs that

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.760
can lead to
oscillations, and they

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.370
showed that for
the loops that are

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.170
made of purely
negative interactions

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.640
like this, if you change
a parameter in order

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.000
to change the period,
you'll also in general

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.990
make the amplitude of the
oscillations drop dramatically.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.424
So that's the sense in
which they're not tunable.

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.090
Whereas if you have
this kind of design,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.510
you can actually tune over, in
some cases a very wide range,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.730
but maintain the amplitude
of the oscillation.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.170
And in addition
to being tunable,

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.130
these things also end up
being robust in various ways.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.300
The oscillation is maintained
subject to various kinds

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.994
of-- If you twiddle with the
parameters, you double this,

00:11:51.994 --> 00:11:54.160
you have that, you still
get nice oscillations here,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.850
whereas in those
designs you tend to lose

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.610
the oscillations more easily.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.500
So they claim that based
on that, that these

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.650
might be more evolvable.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.180
So even in cases where you
don't need to tune the period,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.060
maybe you still end up
evolving towards this design,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.497
just because it's robust
to stochastic fluctuations

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:14.330
in the concentrations
of things, but also it

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.630
might be easier to evolve
these sorts of oscillations.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.270
Are there any questions
about the kind of intuition

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.370
behind this for now?

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.670
There's a nice kind
of circuit analogy

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:34.140
that people often talk about
in the context of this.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.220
So if you imagine you have some
battery, with some voltage, v,

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:50.040
well, we'll say v battery,
some capacitor over here,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.950
but over here you
have something that

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:03.950
will spark at some voltage,
some v t, you get a spark.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.110
Now the question is, well,
what happens over time

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.250
if the threshold is
less than v battery?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.335
We maybe should have
a resistor in here.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.410
So the threshold is
less than v battery,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.352
then this can generate
nice oscillations

00:13:26.352 --> 00:13:28.560
in the voltage say across
the capacitor as a function

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.910
of time, that are tunable.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.020
Because if you plot
as a function of time.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.900
This is the voltage across the
capacitor, where up here we

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:45.160
might have the v, the battery,
here we might have v threshold.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.960
Now in the absence of--
This thing's that's

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.510
going to short
periodically, we're

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.399
just going to charge
up the capacitor.

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:53.690
So in principle, there's
going to be this standard r, c

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.630
time constant, coming up to
here, but before we get there,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.070
we get the spark.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.475
So then we discharge
across here and this drops.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.820
So you get something
that looks like this.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.890
Now you can imagine by changing,
for example, the resistor,

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.270
you can change the rate that
this thing, the capacitor,

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.799
will charge up.

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:24.340
But the amplitude
of the oscillations

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.790
stay constant, because that's
set by the voltage threshold

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:33.270
across this-- where it shorts.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.520
This is capturing this
dynamic of the separation

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.170
of time scales.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.145
So there's a slow time
scale, which is this r,

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:41.370
c time constant, and then
there's the rapid time

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.060
scale is where this shorts out.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.820
So you can imagine
that this is an example

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.880
of an oscillatory
signal that we can

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.798
to tune the frequency without
sacrificing the amplitude.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.580
What we've said so far is that
there are engineering analogs

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.830
to these sorts of
relaxation oscillators.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.140
We can model various
synthetic circuits,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.799
or we can look at natural
oscillatory networks,

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.590
in order to get a sense
of what's going on.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.420
But of course, a major
goal of this kind

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.660
of system synthetic
approach to the field,

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.690
is that if all this
stuff is really true,

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.084
we should be able to build it.

00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:29.000
And there's a very nice
demonstration of this,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.680
also in 2008, by
Jeff Hasty's group.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.470
So Jeff Hasty was actually
trained as a high energy

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:43.020
theorist, and then I think
it was during his postdoc,

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.850
maybe he switched into
experimental biology.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.600
Went and did his postdoc,
I think, with Jim Collins.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.860
And then eventually now has
his own group doing systems

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.160
synthetic biology.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:01.980
In this paper, it was
a Nature paper in 2008,

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.050
it's called A Fast Robust
and Tunable Synthetic Gene

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.640
Oscillator.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.230
It's a nice statement, tells
you what he's about to do.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.830
The data here, this is again
using this basic insight

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.140
of having both interlinked
positive negative feedback

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.420
loops in E. coli.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.740
He demonstrated that he can get
really beautiful oscillations,

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.560
in essentially all the cells,
and that they're tunable,

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.970
enter n period, by a
factor of three, or four,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.510
or so, by a fair amount.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.750
And indeed as fast
as 13 minutes,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.430
the oscillatory period.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.060
Which is pretty nice, right?

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.520
So I encourage you to
check out this paper.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:52.180
This paper was also
an example of how

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.570
it was in principle possible to
get oscillations just by doing

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.370
negative auto regulation.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.980
Right, so this was
a case where they

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.890
designed a gene network
that they could tune

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.920
and had this wonderful property.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.040
But then after they
did that they noticed

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.480
that in their model
at least, they

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.069
could get oscillations
in some parameter regime,

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.099
just by having the negative
auto-regulatory loop.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.565
And as a result of all these
intermediate processes,

00:17:17.565 --> 00:17:19.440
of protein maturation,
and so forth, and then

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.790
they went and they
constructed that network,

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.748
and they showed that that
could also oscillate.

00:17:22.748 --> 00:17:26.040
So again this is an example of
the interplay between modeling,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.190
experiment theory,
modeling, And Jeff Hasty

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.050
has gone on to write
another several,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.840
really beautiful papers looking
at these sorts of oscillations,

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.490
looking at how you can get
synchronization of oscillators,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.550
and you get period
doubling ideas.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.571
It's really a whole string of
wonderful, wonderful papers.

00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:47.070
So I encourage you to, if you're
interested in oscillations,

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.700
to look at Jeff Hasty's
work over the years.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.170
If you want a quick
introduction to these papers,

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.200
I also wrote a news and views
in Nature on these two papers.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.364
So you can read that,
it's only a page.

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:09.030
Although I guess you
won't hear anything

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.696
that you haven't
already heard probably.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.300
Any other questions
about this idea

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.560
of how we can use both positive
and negative feedback in order

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.685
to get some nice
oscillatory properties?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.040
OK, then let's move on.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.150
What did you guys think of
this paper, the Barabasi paper?

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.696
Good, bad, difficult, easy?

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:45.570
AUDIENCE: Why does it
have so many citations?

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.780
PROFESSOR: Why does it
have so many citations?

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.540
All right that's
an inter-- and you

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.400
should look at how many--
according to Google Scholar,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.670
I haven't checked this year, but
it's probably 20,000 citations.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.211
I mean it's--

00:18:53.211 --> 00:18:55.092
AUDIENCE: Is it a cult thing?

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.300
PROFESSOR: It's a cult thing.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.510
Well, I don't know.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.110
That might be exaggerating.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.720
AUDIENCE: I mean
it's a nice paper.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.455
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:05.830
So this is interesting, and
I think that the basic answer

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.950
is that there are
networks that are

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.690
relevant in many, many, many
fields, which they allude to.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.240
And there are many
researchers that

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.570
have been excited about
studying those networks

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:23.115
in many, many fields, and many,
many, many of the networks that

00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:27.460
are observed in nature or
social science, the web,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.890
everywhere, they have
these power law structures.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:37.220
And this is the first
clear simple mechanism

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.290
to generate it.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.220
My understanding
is that actually

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.530
a mathematician decades
before, actually

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.590
did demonstrate that
this kind of thing

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.510
could be constructed,
that would lead to this,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.685
but that paper doesn't
have 20,000 citations.

00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:51.310
I mean like it's a
lot of these things,

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.101
you have to be the
right time, right place,

00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:54.960
and have the right idea.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess my
main thought about the paper

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.460
is exactly that, the
interesting thing about it was,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.964
it came out at about the time
that data on large networks

00:20:03.964 --> 00:20:04.900
was readily available.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.900
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.490
There's a reason that this paper
was published at this time,

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.010
and of course if Barabasi
didn't do it here,

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.520
someone else would have
done it a year or two later.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.610
But it was really that the
data were available everywhere,

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.160
and we were seeing these
power law distributions,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.900
and it's really crying
out for an explanation.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.425
I think it's-- You know
sometimes people complain,

00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:32.050
that they say, oh yeah, you know
I could have come up with this

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.380
idea, it's not that deep.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.220
And maybe you could
have, but you didn't.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.625
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.760
PROFESSOR: And also
I'd say that Barabasi

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.040
has a record of doing
interesting things,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.460
and being the first to
point out a simple idea.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.800
If you can reliably be
the first to point out

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.590
a simple explanation
for important things,

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.780
then that's another
kind of genius, right?

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.040
I mean-- and it's
the kind of genius

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.500
that I aspire to, because I
know that I'm not going to reach

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.680
the other kind of genius.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.970
I mean there are some things you
look at, oh well, I would never

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.530
be able to do that, right?

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.530
And everyone agrees
that that's hard.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.830
But I think that
there is something

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.920
about being able to see what
the scientific opportunities are

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.340
at a given time,
and you don't have

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.330
to come up with a
really complicated model

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.280
or proof in order to have
really important impact.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.730
And this paper is
way beyond, in terms

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.120
of number of people that
have read it, cited it,

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.090
and so forth, it's
way beyond, probably

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.320
any other paper you'll
likely read in your life.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.985
Yes?

00:21:50.985 --> 00:21:51.850
AUDIENCE: Just more thoughts.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.891
PROFESSOR: More thoughts.

00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:54.584
Yeah, that's fine.

00:21:54.584 --> 00:21:57.140
AUDIENCE: I guess,
what's interesting is,

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.452
it starts a conversation, so
we can analyze these networks,

00:22:01.452 --> 00:22:06.798
and the feature that
works the best [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:06.798 --> 00:22:08.499
starts that
conversation, there's

00:22:08.499 --> 00:22:12.920
still a lot more that we
can do with it [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.370
I think that's why I like it.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.370
PROFESSOR: That's a totally--
so this is the Barabasi and Reka

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.880
Albert.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.140
So Barabasi is a professor
over at Northeastern now,

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.192
Reka Albert is a
professor at Penn State,

00:22:28.192 --> 00:22:30.400
and I think they've both
gone on to do what, I think,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.290
are really very interesting
things in this network space,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.310
and more generally.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.840
So I you encourage you to
check out what each of them

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.940
have been doing over the years.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.395
All right, so this model, what
are the two key ingredients

00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:47.895
of this model?

00:22:47.895 --> 00:22:49.770
AUDIENCE: Growth and
preferential attachment.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.228
PROFESSOR: Right,
so the two things

00:22:51.228 --> 00:22:55.750
you should be able to
recapitulate on an exam

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.070
is that there are
two assumptions here,

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.630
there's growth, and there's
preferential attachment.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.714
And we'll talk about
the degree to which we

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.630
think each of those
things might be necessary,

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:11.270
but what's the key-- Can
somebody be a little more

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.770
explicit than what
we've been so far

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.380
about what the
key observation is

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.700
that we're trying to explain?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.060
AUDIENCE: There are nodes
that, inactive nodes,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.860
that have more edges than you
expect, either by random or--

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.710
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.480
Perfect, right.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:35.205
Observation-- So some
nodes have lots of edges.

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:37.630
AUDIENCE: I mean it is
sort of a meta irony

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.055
that this paper is
now very widely cited.

00:23:40.055 --> 00:23:41.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.205
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:42.205 --> 00:23:43.830
AUDIENCE: Every time
we talk about it--

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.700
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.044
Indeed it is ironic,
and we'll talk

00:23:50.044 --> 00:23:51.960
about how the scaling
of the citation networks

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.510
go in a moment.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.670
Right, so some nodes
have lots of edges,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.915
and you want to be
very clear about this,

00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:02.520
this is what you're
trying to explain.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.630
So it's a power law
distribution, so in particular,

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.380
you quantify this thing.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.020
That the probability
of having k nodes,

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.300
or I'm sorry, the probability
that a node has k edges,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:19.780
falls off as a power law, 1
over k to some power 2, 3, 4.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:26.450
So the probability of having
k edges, goes as 1 over k

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.310
to some power alpha.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:33.610
Where alpha is maybe between
2 and 4, for a lot of these.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.774
Now it's important
to make sure that you

00:24:37.774 --> 00:24:39.440
keep this qualitative
statement in mind,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.980
because it's true that it
falls off, and sort of rapidly.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.250
Right, 1 over k squared, k
cubed, or k to the fourth,

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.190
you'd say, oh, that's a
pretty rapid fall off.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.010
Right?

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.540
But it's not rapid
compared to what?

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.054
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:54.054 --> 00:24:54.970
PROFESSOR: --exponent.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:55.470
Right.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.050
So for these other models then,
it falls off exponentially.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:24:59.550
Right?

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.320
So even faster.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.570
So it's easy to look at
1 over k to the fourth,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.710
and think, oh, that's
a fast fall off.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.070
We have to remember
that it's slow

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.890
compared to some other things.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:16.330
So in particular, if you look
at the data for real networks,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.700
and you see that the probability
distribution in many cases

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.490
goes over orders of magnitude
in terms of this probability.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.950
You think oh,
that's a big range.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.180
And it is a big
range, but the fact

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.980
is that you actually see
some nodes with the thousand

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.480
ideas or whatnot,
which is something

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.100
that you would just never see,
if it were a random network,

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.500
or if it were not a power
law distributed network.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.700
And I think that this
is also highlighting

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:49.417
another statement, which is
that a powerful way to make

00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.750
a difference, for example,
if you're going to write down

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.710
a model, or you're
going to do a theory,

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.840
is that it's nice if there's
a clear observation that

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.405
needs to be explained.

00:26:00.405 --> 00:26:01.780
Because you can
always write down

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.120
a model of something,
and maybe you'll

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.110
find something interesting.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.950
But a way to massively
increase the probability

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.830
that you're going to discover
something interesting

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.710
is if you already know there's
something interesting there

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.880
and that you're
trying to explain it.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.710
And I think that
this is an example

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.876
of that, right there, it
was already an observation,

00:26:24.876 --> 00:26:26.160
it was already known.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.510
It's not that he was the first
person to make those plots.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.910
There are other plots of
citation networks before.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.800
So Sid Redner, for
example, had already

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.530
done some analyses
of citation networks,

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.410
he's a theoretical statistical
physicist over at BU,

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:47.830
but just now, I guess, moving
over to the Santa Fe Institute.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.550
But it's not that he
was the first person

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.715
to make that
observation, but he knew

00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:55.090
there was something interesting
that needed to explained.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.810
So I'd say that
for any of you that

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.880
are thinking about doing
theory, or writing down models,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.537
I would say, whenever
possible start

00:27:05.537 --> 00:27:06.870
with an interesting observation.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.510
So can somebody-- maybe you
guys could just throw out,

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.470
what are some examples
of nodes and edges that

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.780
were given there or elsewhere?

00:27:22.469 --> 00:27:24.577
AUDIENCE: Web pages and links.

00:27:24.577 --> 00:27:26.160
PROFESSOR: Right,
web pages and links.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.319
And is this a directed
or undirected?

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:36.110
AUDIENCE: Directed.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.693
PROFESSOR: So this
is indeed directed.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.576
Some others?

00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:43.950
AUDIENCE: Movie
stars and movies.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.366
PROFESSOR: Movie
stars and movies.

00:27:45.366 --> 00:27:53.610
This one's a funny one, rig--
So movie stars and then this

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.650
is like being in a
movie together, right?

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.140
So co-starring or so.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.778
Others?

00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:06.359
AUDIENCE: Articles
and Citations.

00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:07.775
PROFESSOR: Articles
and citations.

00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:22.650
And this is again directed, and
this is not directed, right?

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.970
And we can maybe even
try to remind ourselves,

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.490
this fell off as alpha
was equal to what?

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.110
I guess it was 3,
I think they said.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:48.080
Actors work around
2.3, I guess they said.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.540
The web was 2.1.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.110
Just because it's
a power law doesn't

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.960
mean that it's always going
to have the same alpha right?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.320
But for example, what this means
is that for every paper that

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.380
has say 200 citations,
there are going

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.610
to be roughly 10 papers
that have 100 citations.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.630
If you increase k
by a factor of 2,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.382
you get almost an
order of magnitude

00:29:16.382 --> 00:29:18.090
in terms of the
probability distribution.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.390
So this is an
interesting observation,

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.110
and where Barabasi
came in and said,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.610
well, what would be a model
that would recapitulate this?

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.485
And what are the models that
did not recapitulate it?

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:45.142
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:45.142 --> 00:29:45.850
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.300
So the Erdos Renyi--
so other models,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:56.550
there's the E R,
other models, there's

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:04.580
the Erdos Renyi
network, random network,

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:10.470
and that's because here the
degree distribution is peaked

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.830
around something and then
falls off exponentially

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.270
as you go above that.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.740
And this is actually where
I think the equations are

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.620
wrong in this paper.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.720
Because if you look at
the paper, page 510,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.970
where they say the
Erdos Renyi, you

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.400
connect the edges
of probability p,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.640
and then they say you get a
poisson distribution, p of k,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.180
where lambda the mean is
something, but then they say,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.440
oh lambda is equal to some
binomial of something of k,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.790
and so forth.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.560
So I think this is all not
true, but rather that you

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.450
can approximate the
binomial with a poisson

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.300
in the limit of small Ps.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.840
So be aware if you're
looking at that.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.210
I know-- there was
another network that--

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.496
Do you have a question?

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:05.371
AUDIENCE: Oh, no, no.

00:31:05.371 --> 00:31:07.120
I was--

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.430
PROFESSOR: So we're
going to spend

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.200
a lot of time talking about
probability distributions

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.440
in the coming weeks, but I just
wanted to highlight that there,

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.750
as far as I tell, that is
not true what they say.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.590
But there was one other
model for a network

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.760
that they talk about,
or they mention.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.094
Does anybody--

00:31:29.094 --> 00:31:30.010
AUDIENCE: Small world.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.960
PROFESSOR: The so-called
small world network, right?

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.830
And this is-- small
world network,

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:44.640
and this is based on a paper by
Strogatz-- Watts and Strogatz,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.170
small world.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:52.574
That's Watts and
Strogatz, and this

00:31:52.574 --> 00:31:54.490
was a paper where they
demonstrated that there

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.650
was a very simple mechanism.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.880
Just by rewiring
a network that you

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.880
could get this so-called
small world phenomenon.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.110
Where the Kevin Bacon thing,
where you can take any--

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:09.090
You're right, from Kevin Bacon,
and this is actually the actor

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.770
network, so you could say,
starting with Kevin Bacon

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.981
can you construct
a list of actors

00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:16.480
that costarred with
each person that

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.810
gets you to any given actor.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.185
And the statement
is that you are

00:32:19.185 --> 00:32:23.180
supposed to be able to do
that from a path of six.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.760
So that all the
actors are supposed

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.094
to be connected to
Kevin Bacon by six.

00:32:28.094 --> 00:32:29.510
Although maybe you
guys don't even

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.230
remember who Kevin
Bacon is anymore.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.896
Oh, you do?

00:32:32.896 --> 00:32:35.430
OK.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.800
This rule works for anybody so
just insert your favorite actor

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.840
into that sentence.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.470
And it's important,
just to mention

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.280
that just because something
is a small world network,

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.880
does not mean that it has
power law distributions.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.170
It may be the case that
many power law networks also

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.960
have this small world
character, and I'd

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.750
say maybe even most
of them, because some

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.100
of those highly
connected nodes are

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.354
going to be useful
for connecting anybody

00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:07.020
to anybody else.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.960
But that's not required to
get the small world character.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.715
Any questions about
that statement?

00:33:20.857 --> 00:33:23.148
AUDIENCE: So you can go from
this small world statement

00:33:23.148 --> 00:33:26.136
to any sort of strong statement
concerning connectivity?

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.950
PROFESSOR: Well stron-- I guess
that the strong statement is

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:38.890
that this property does
not imply that property.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.190
AUDIENCE: You're not
saying that the universe is

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.948
true [INAUDIBLE]
because it seems

00:33:43.948 --> 00:33:46.700
like, at least the
examples we've listed,

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.724
ought to be small world.

00:33:47.724 --> 00:33:48.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.090
I agree.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.300
I think that this
small world property,

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:57.820
that's why I saying that,
it's-- What I do not know,

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.444
it's whether it would be
possible to construct a power

00:34:01.444 --> 00:34:03.860
law distributed network that
does not have the small world

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.750
property, but I would say is
that the ones that I'm aware

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.960
of would have the small
world property arm.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.840
Any other questions
about where we are?

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.260
So there's interesting
properties of networks

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.530
that we would like to explain.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:25.469
And I would say that
what this paper does,

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.929
I think kind of convincingly,
is that they demonstrate

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.810
that at least this model, and
we'll get into the assumptions,

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.078
does lead to a power
law distributed network.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.060
The answer to the
reading questions

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.350
about whether both of these
is strictly necessary,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.860
I think was an
interesting one, and I'd

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.699
say that this gets into
the wider issue of there's

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.400
a observation that
is maybe interesting.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.910
And then we want to
understand why that might be,

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.500
and then what you can do is
you can write down a model that

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.736
leads to that behavior.

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:06.860
We've already talked about.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.901
Does that prove that the
assumptions of the model

00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:10.330
are correct?

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.580
No.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.850
In this case, these are
pretty generic features

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.190
of lots and lots of the network.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.780
So when you read it
you kind of believe

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.510
that this is a
dominant mechanism,

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.770
but it very much does not
prove that these are the only,

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.710
this is not at all the only way
to get a power law distributed

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.354
network.

00:35:29.354 --> 00:35:31.270
I'd say that some of the
language in the paper

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.350
might kind of lead you to
believe that that is the case,

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.046
and I think this is a standard
logical fallacy that we have

00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:39.420
to be careful of,
and something I

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.044
think that some the language
is a little bit dangerous.

00:35:43.044 --> 00:35:44.710
The development of
the power law scaling

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.168
the model indicates that growth
and preferential attachment

00:35:47.168 --> 00:35:50.120
play an important
role in networ-- I'd

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.260
say that it's quite true,
but once again this question

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.050
of-- This is
certainly not a proof,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.040
that those assumptions are
relevant for any given network.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.340
Of course, in all of these
cases, the network does grow,

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.850
and there is
preferential attachment.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.850
But there are other
things that are also true,

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.340
that may be important,
for example,

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.230
in determining exactly what
alpha is or in other things.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.000
And I think that as
indicated that there

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.470
are other ways of
getting power law

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.790
networks without making
the exact assumptions that

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.600
are here.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.340
But its, in my
mind, it's probably

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.160
a or d dominant mechanism
in a lot of these networks.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.220
I think it's a fine
paper, but just

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.361
remember that it doesn't
prove that those are

00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:35.610
the only two important things.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.342
Yes?

00:36:40.342 --> 00:36:42.425
AUDIENCE: Just above the
preferential attachments,

00:36:42.425 --> 00:36:44.900
I think you mentioned that
you tried different ways,

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.170
and only the linearly one was

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.437
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:48.437 --> 00:36:49.270
PROFESSOR:Troubling.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.340
PROFESSOR: I agree.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:52.840
I agree.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.220
And what they assume
in the model here

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.180
is that the preferential
attachment goes linearly

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.130
with the number
of existing edges.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:09.290
And I would say that
I very much believe

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.414
that preferential attachment
is present in all those things,

00:37:12.414 --> 00:37:14.330
but I'm sure that if you
go and you measure it

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.800
you're not going to
find that its linear

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.841
with the number of edges.

00:37:16.841 --> 00:37:19.585
It's going to--
actually, I don't

00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:21.460
know what you'll find
in each of those cases,

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.760
but there's no reason to
believe it has to be linear.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.940
That being said it may
be, the question is

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.020
how strong of a deviation
from linearity is there?

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.290
And then how sensitive is the
power law behavior to that?

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.150
And that's the kind
of thing that I'm

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.970
sure that one of the
20,000 papers that

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.380
have cited this paper
in the last 15 years

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.522
address this issue.

00:37:43.522 --> 00:37:45.980
Yeah, but I mean, this is also
why there are so many papers

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.600
that have cite-- It's like
you read this paper , like oh,

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.016
you know, it would be really
interesting to do this, tha--

00:37:50.016 --> 00:37:52.870
and people have been
following that interest.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.730
Let's go and-- I think that
the derivation is a little bit

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.790
tricky, and so I think it's
worth just walking through it.

00:38:06.375 --> 00:38:08.000
Especially since some
people apparently

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
couldn't even get the equations,
which is going to be a problem.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.410
Maybe while we're
on this question

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:39.790
of preferential
attachment-- How do

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.510
you guys feel about this
question of networks

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.850
within, say the
transcriptional network

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.210
of E. coli or other cells?

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:51.230
I mean do you think that
these properties are

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.140
relevant in the cell or--

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.362
So what would growth mean?

00:39:15.362 --> 00:39:17.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.865
PROFESSOR: So growth
would correspond

00:39:19.865 --> 00:39:20.740
to adding a new gene.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.269
Does that ever happen?

00:39:22.269 --> 00:39:22.852
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.130
PROFESSOR: Can some given
a possible mechanism

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.260
by which a new gene is
added to the genome?

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.550
AUDIENCE: Duplication.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.010
PROFESSOR: For example,
duplication is common, right?

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.151
eg.

00:39:39.151 --> 00:39:39.650
duplication.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.910
So what does this mean for
preferential attachment?

00:39:56.557 --> 00:39:58.890
AUDIENCE: --duplicate the
gene and it will probably also

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.572
duplicate the promoter
region, which means--

00:40:02.572 --> 00:40:03.280
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.690
So this, I think,
is very interesting.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.370
So duplication,
in general you'll

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.130
duplicate both the coding region
makes protein, but also maybe

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.610
the promoter region that
specifies the regulation.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.820
So if you imagine
you have some x here

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.290
that is-- And we can
remind ourselves,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.780
are both the incoming and
outgoing edges power law

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.190
distributed in
transcription networks?

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.320
No, I know this was in
the pre-class reading,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.860
but just in case.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.460
So what you find is that some
transcription factors regulate

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.570
many genes, but we don't
have any proteins that

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:49.220
are regulated by 200 genes,
so in that sense typically

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.230
we have the things
that are regulated,

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:56.360
there's maybe some x1, x2, x3.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.740
And there might be a
few incoming edges,

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.950
so the expression a gene
is typically specified

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.460
by a few transcription factors.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.180
Whereas some
transcription factors

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.700
might have 100 outgoing edges.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.140
So it's the outgoing edges
that are power law distributed,

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.510
and the ingoing are closer
to being plus on or so.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:21.420
So you can imagine that this
guy might have 100 or so,

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.410
whereas over here
some y transcription

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:27.690
factor that is just regulating
two genes, say y1, and y2.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.290
Now, question is,
if gene duplication

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.580
occurs kind of randomly
throughout the genome,

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.740
which transcription
factor x or y

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.282
is more likely to have a
target that's duplicated?

00:41:48.282 --> 00:41:49.250
AUDIENCE: x.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.150
PROFESSOR: x, all right.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.215
Interestingly, how
does that scale

00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:54.340
with the number of targets?

00:41:57.258 --> 00:41:58.150
AUDIENCE: Linear?

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.540
PROFESSOR: This actually
is linear, right?

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.930
So I'd say that gene
duplication does

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:07.970
give growth and
preferential attachment that

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.680
is basically linear with
a number of targets.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.930
It's interesting I'd say I
find this kind of observation

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.860
quite interesting,
and compelling,

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.080
and makes me feel kind
of comfortable about this

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.540
as a mechanism for some
of the global properties.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.750
I mean there's no
selection, there's

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.010
no way to explain the
interesting network motifs

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.468
and so forth here,
but I'd say just

00:42:31.468 --> 00:42:33.210
in terms of some
general properties I

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.640
think it's interesting.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.390
Of course, once
again not a proof.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.100
Evolution can do whatever
it wants with these gene

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.360
duplication events, but also
I would say not everybody

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.140
finds this argument
very, very compelling.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.540
But I'd say I think
it's kind of-- I

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.844
get a warm fuzzy feeling inside.

00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:54.229
AUDIENCE: We're talking
about transcription network,

00:42:54.229 --> 00:42:56.770
it's different from the other
networks you were talking about

00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:00.760
in that you also lose genes,
and so is there any discussion--

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.647
PROFESSOR: Well you know, you
could lose web pages, you can--

00:43:06.647 --> 00:43:08.272
AUDIENCE: Are you
losing them nearly as

00:43:08.272 --> 00:43:13.090
fast as you're adding them?

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I don't know.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:20.190
I find that lots of links
to my web pages just

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:26.090
disappear over time, and I--
It's a reasonable question.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:31.450
I don't-- In some of these
you say, oh well right,

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.970
so with the web has been
growing a lot recently,

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:37.370
and so then we'd say the birth
dominates over death there.

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.830
Where if you talk about genome
sizes along different lineages,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.686
it certainly is not
growing exponentially

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:43.560
the way the web pag--

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.340
I think that that's
fair and true,

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.410
but we haven't really actually
specified or made clear,

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.400
within a model what happens if
you allow for birth and death.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.830
But I think that you
could introduce death

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.590
and recapitulate these
behaviors, so it's

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:01.030
not-- I think just because
some nodes disappear,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.640
doesn't mean that
we have to throw

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.962
the whole idea out the window.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.040
But in the presence
of evolution this

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.880
is all very complicated, right?

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.525
So you can't carry
this argument too far.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.950
AUDIENCE: So it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.570
PROFESSOR: Well
what we're assuming

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:33.122
is that there is some segment of
DNA that's in front of the gene

00:44:33.122 --> 00:44:34.580
that specifies--
gives instructions

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:40.050
of when to transcribe the gene.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.410
So the linearity is
really just assuming

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:48.782
that genes have the same rate
of being duplicated on average.

00:44:48.782 --> 00:44:50.240
And this is a very
global property,

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.982
so I think that it's
kind of roughly--

00:44:55.982 --> 00:44:58.190
I would say it's the middle
model that you would use,

00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:59.737
if you're had to
write an old model.

00:45:05.735 --> 00:45:07.860
AUDIENCE: Is there anything
in looking for evidence

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.870
to support [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.910
PROFESSOR: That's an
interesting question.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.840
It's hard to know
what it would even

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.710
mean to collect the evidence
to support it in the sense

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:21.260
that-- You're saying along
different evolutionary

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:27.640
lineages, could we say that
it's more likely to grow.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.360
Of course the other thing to
say is that, the rate of death

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.210
would also scale linearly.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.739
In the sense that a gene
being stochastically removed

00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:39.530
from the genome should
also scale linearly,

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.570
so it's not that
you don't actually

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.110
then expect there to be
any systematic change.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.010
I mean it's not as
simple as just saying, oh

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.990
the number of targets of
a transcription factor

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.002
with many targets
should grow faster.

00:45:53.002 --> 00:45:54.460
It's really that
the expectation is

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.230
that it should be changing
faster because both duplication

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.020
and removal would
both be increasing.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.370
So I think the signature is not
totally obvious in that sense.

00:46:10.966 --> 00:46:12.340
So how many people
actually tried

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:16.710
to piece this derivation apart?

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.570
Anybody?

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:22.790
All right, and were you happy
with it at the end of your--

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:23.790
AUDIENCE: I think that--

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.120
PROFESSOR: --permissions?

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.380
AUDIENCE: --that I was
a little bit iffy about.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.030
PROFESSOR:There is like a
crux of the climb at the end.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.370
So let's make sure that we can
understand what happened there.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:39.240
It's worth-- since we
read the paper it's worth

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.240
trying to figure it out.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.720
So what we're going to assume
is that we start with m0 nodes.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.700
So they're going to
be here, and the idea

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.010
is it doesn't really matter
how we start this thing.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.480
They might start out
being unconnected,

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.180
or they might he connected.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.910
But over time the
signature how we start

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.892
is not supposed to
be that important.

00:47:09.892 --> 00:47:12.050
What we're going to do is
at each time point we're

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.830
going to add one more node.

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:20.500
And as we do that we're
going to add m edges as well.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.420
So we then have the number
of, we'll say, nodes,

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.860
N, as a function of time, is
going to be equal to what?

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.124
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:37.124 --> 00:47:37.790
PROFESSOR:Right.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.120
This is just going to be--
we're going to start at m0

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.530
and we're going to add
1 each time, m0 plus 2.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.000
Number of edges is just going
to be equal to the number

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.190
that we add each time
point, times the time.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:56.142
So here we're assuming
that we start out

00:47:56.142 --> 00:47:57.600
with these nodes
being unconnected.

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:04.540
Now we're given the
assumption that there's

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.840
preferential attachment,
so that means

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.150
that the probability
of connecting

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:15.430
to some i-th node
that has k edges

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:19.650
is going to be k
to the i divided

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:28.350
by the sum over all the edges.

00:48:30.856 --> 00:48:31.355
Yes?

00:48:31.355 --> 00:48:33.765
AUDIENCE: Why is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:33.765 --> 00:48:35.390
PROFESSOR: All right,
so the assumption

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:41.010
is at each time point we add a
new node, let's say this node,

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.440
and with that we bring in
some number, n, of new edges.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.780
So this could be 3,
and then we go randomly

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.710
to 3 of the existing nodes.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:56.083
So each time point
we add m edges.

00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:59.464
AUDIENCE: How do we necessarily
add them to the new node?

00:48:59.464 --> 00:49:00.430
Like [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:07.741 --> 00:49:09.990
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry I don't
understa-- oh yeah right,

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:14.150
so the assumption is that
the new node is indeed

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:18.300
being connected to-- that
all m edges that we're adding

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.470
are to this new node.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.576
So this is the linear
preferential attachment

00:49:25.576 --> 00:49:26.700
that we were talking about.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.120
So what we want
to know first, is

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.240
how after a node is connected,
how is it that number of edges

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.010
will grow over time.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.400
What we know is
that when it's first

00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.000
added it has it
exactly m edges, right?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.797
But then as new nodes come,
then we'll maybe get some more

00:50:02.797 --> 00:50:03.630
and then it'll grow.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:12.090
And in particular
we want to get--

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.860
We're told that it's going
to grow as this differential

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:24.400
equation, so we want
to kind of get to this.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.050
And the way to
think about this is

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.200
that, all right well, how is
it that the number of edges

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.580
will change at each time
point, so delta k i.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:38.300
Well the expected
number of edges

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.680
that will be attached to
some node, well that's

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.870
going to be m,
this is the number

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:50.170
of edges that were attached
by this incoming node,

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:56.350
times this probability of
attaching to this node.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.350
So this is the
probability of k i.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:03.680
Now this is in one time step.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.970
So this is really a delta k i.

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.261
If we want, we could say over
some delta t, which is 1.

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.462
So from that standpoint, we
can actually then write it

00:51:12.462 --> 00:51:13.920
as differential
equation, where you

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.320
say the change in this number
of edges with respect to time

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.130
is indeed going to
be equal to m times

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:27.870
this guy here, which
is the number of edges

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:34.410
that that node has at this time,
divided by this sum over all

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:34.910
those edges.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.340
This is just kind of the
expected number of edges

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.403
to be added to that
node at each time point.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.516
What does this thing-- What
does that thing equal to?

00:51:52.516 --> 00:51:54.488
Yes?

00:51:54.488 --> 00:51:56.131
AUDIENCE: --that
equation, because it

00:51:56.131 --> 00:51:58.925
seemed like you just wrote
the same equation on the line

00:51:58.925 --> 00:52:00.404
above that line.

00:52:00.404 --> 00:52:03.855
You just substituted it--

00:52:03.855 --> 00:52:04.841
PROFESSOR: I did.

00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:12.314
AUDIENCE: OK, but [INAUDIBLE]
wrote it as [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:14.917 --> 00:52:17.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is
kind of the discrete version

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.269
of this differential equation.

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:19.810
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:21.200
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.120
Yeah that's right, that's right.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.120
And of course the beginning
could be highly stochastic

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.950
but we're just thinking
about in the limit

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.010
of if it's deterministic.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:40.230
What is this thing in
terms of-- from here

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.530
this is just a normalization
constant, right?

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:46.076
Because each edge has to
be attached somewhere,

00:52:46.076 --> 00:52:47.700
we're assuming it's
linear with respect

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.744
to the number of edges
at each node, right?

00:52:49.744 --> 00:52:51.410
And that means that
for normalization we

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:56.910
have to divide by the sum over
all those edges, the edges

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:59.490
that each of the
nodes might have.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.580
What is this thing equal to
in terms of something else

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.540
that we might have on the board?

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.040
Yeah?

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.062
AUDIENCE: These have edges
with respect to [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:09.062 --> 00:53:09.770
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.920
So I guess the question is
this, can we write this?

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:18.920
Where E is a function of time?

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.940
Is that correct?

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.240
So we're getting some shakes.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.762
AUDIENCE: Isn't it 2E?

00:53:28.762 --> 00:53:29.470
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:30.310
So it's actually 2E.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.860
Because what you notice
here is that this

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.400
is the sum over all of the edges
that each of the nodes have.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.810
But each edge is
connecting 2 nodes.

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.620
So the sum over all
these edge distributions

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.330
is twice the number of edges.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.540
Now I would say as a
physicist, working in biology,

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.970
my general attitude is
that a factor of 2 here,

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:55.630
factor of 2 there,
doesn't really matter.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:57.640
But this factor of 2
actually is relevant

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.140
because it ends up determining
the scaling over time.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.420
So not all factors of
2 are created equal,

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:08.930
and this is one that is
worth paying attention to.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:10.729
Does everyone here
understand why this

00:54:10.729 --> 00:54:12.020
is 2 times the number of edges?

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.247
k1 is equal to 1, k2 is
equal to 1, number of edges

00:54:21.247 --> 00:54:21.830
is equal to 1.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.019
Yeah.

00:54:27.019 --> 00:54:30.135
AUDIENCE: So that means we're
in an undirected network,

00:54:30.135 --> 00:54:31.510
if we were in a
directed network,

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.695
then we would not
have that factor of 2.

00:54:34.695 --> 00:54:35.320
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.065
So we are indeed
in an undirected,

00:54:37.065 --> 00:54:38.440
and I'd say in a
directed network

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.481
you have to then be more
careful about what you--

00:54:40.481 --> 00:54:43.430
you have to specify
the k's in and k's out.

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:44.970
So actually, already
just by writing

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.300
this we've already
assumed it's undirected,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.410
because we haven't
specified what we mean by k.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.820
We're here, but
very conveniently we

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.640
already know how
many edges there

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.680
are as a function of time.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.680
This is just equal to m times t.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.740
So we get something that's very
convenient ki divided by 2 t.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:16.220
From here we can solve
the differential equation.

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.890
This is what we want to show.

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.310
The fact that we're
doing partials

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.870
doesn't really matter,
because it's just time here.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:28.780
So it's really-- so
we have d ki over ki,

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.220
is equal to dt over 2t.

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.280
This 2, really again,
is going to make

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.450
a difference, because when
we go and we integrate,

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:44.370
we get the logs and so forth.

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.620
And so we get that ki
as a function of time

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.130
is going to grow with
time, with some constant c,

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:53.024
proportionality to the
square root of time.

00:55:53.024 --> 00:55:55.690
So if we didn't have the half it
would just be linear with time.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.800
Now how do we know
what c-- in general

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.640
how do we get constants
of integration in life?

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.890
AUDIENCE: Boundary conditions.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:07.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
boundary conditions,

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.270
in this case, the
initial condition.

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:10.436
And what is it that we know?

00:56:14.424 --> 00:56:15.952
AUDIENCE: ki.

00:56:15.952 --> 00:56:16.660
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:21.400
So what we know is that
ki, so this i-th node,

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.570
when it's added at time ti,
it should be equal to what?

00:56:27.366 --> 00:56:28.314
AUDIENCE: m.

00:56:28.314 --> 00:56:28.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:29.646
It's equal to m.

00:56:29.646 --> 00:56:31.470
So when it's first
added, at some time ti,

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:33.910
its number of edges
is equal to m.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.670
Because that's what we've
assumed, is that we add a node

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.920
and we connect it
randomly and other things,

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.820
so it has m edges initially.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:46.560
So from this kot, this
is then equal to m

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:51.620
times the square root of
t divided by t initial.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:55.520
Where ti is the time that i-th
node was added to the network.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.068
Are there any questions
about how we got there?

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.040
So I think that this is
relatively straightforward.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.000
The part that gets
confusing is this later part

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.630
about the probabilities and
keeping everything straight.

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.709
And so what Barabasi
did next, is

00:57:20.709 --> 00:57:22.750
he said, all right, well,
what we're going to do,

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:26.620
is we're going to talk
about the probability, P.

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.670
Now this is an actual honest
to goodness probability.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.026
The big P is actually
a probability,

00:57:34.026 --> 00:57:35.650
and that's as compared
to a probability

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:40.310
distribution, little p.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:44.239
And I'll put in a little curly
here thing, so it's a little p.

00:57:44.239 --> 00:57:46.780
This is saying if you want to
get an actual probability here,

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.071
then you have to multiply
that probability distribution

00:57:49.071 --> 00:57:51.890
times some range delta k.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:53.960
If you want to know
that the probability

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:58.310
that some node has between
some number and some number

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:02.220
of edges, then you
multiply it by that range.

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:02.720
Right?

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:09.070
Probability distribution,
this is an actual probability.

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.310
And as befits an
actual probability,

00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:16.230
we're going to say, OK the
probability that the i-th node

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:22.300
has k edges, that are
less than some value k.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.640
And remember this thing is
actually a function of time.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.590
But we have an expression
for ki as a function of time,

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:32.381
it's equal to this.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.480
So we can solve when we show
that this probability is also

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.960
the same as this
other probability.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.400
That the i-th node was
added after some time

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.940
t that can be written as this.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.050
So this is saying,
the probability

00:58:55.050 --> 00:59:00.310
that some random, say i-th
node, has fewer than k edges,

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:03.990
is the same as saying
it's the probability

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.360
that the i-th node was
added after some time, t,

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.430
which is this thing.

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.450
Because the number of
edges will grow over

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.610
time for each of these nodes.

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:22.230
Do you understand that kind
of conceptual statement

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.426
that was made there?

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.040
Yes?

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.710
Any questions?

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.270
All right, so the probability
that this i-th node was added

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:41.082
after this time, is also of
course 1 minus the probability

00:59:41.082 --> 00:59:42.540
that it was added
before that time.

00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:58.350
Whereas time, little t
here, this is at the time

00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.310
that you're actually looking.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:03.002
So this is saying, oh well, if
little t is 100, for example,

01:00:03.002 --> 01:00:04.710
it's saying all right,
at that time point

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:07.240
after I got 100 nodes, we
want to say, all right, what's

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.500
the probably that some
random i-th node was

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.420
added before this quantity.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.430
And this is just again
some other kind of time,

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:14.855
if you'd like.

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.710
I think this is the part that
it is especially kind of weird.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.210
So this is also
equal to this thing.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.260
And I think
reasonable people can

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.770
argue about exactly what
you should write here,

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:36.610
but let's figure out the
basic argument first.

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:40.730
So there's this probability
is equal to this thing.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:49.020
So this statement is really that
at some time t we have how many

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:49.520
nodes?

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.490
We have m0 plus t nodes, right?

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.650
So this is something here.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.170
And of course there are edges
going around doing things.

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.400
And what we want to know
is, what's the probability

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.500
if I grab one of
them, we're going

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.610
to call that the i-th node.

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:11.050
What's the probability
if I grab one of them

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:17.310
that it was added
before sometime here.

01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:20.290
And it's useful to just imagine
this is as just being some time

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:28.350
t, just so that we don't get
confused by all the symbols.

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.080
You say, oh well,
that probability

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.167
is really just the probability--
well how many nodes total do

01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:36.840
we have here, m0 plus t.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.820
How many nodes were there that
were added before this time t?

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:45.334
Well that's going to be t, you
might want to say t plus m0.

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.750
There's a question of whether
you include those nodes that

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:50.100
started there or not.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:53.650
Given the equations that
Barabasi wrote down,

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:55.137
he kind of assumes
that we're only

01:01:55.137 --> 01:01:56.845
counting the nodes
that were added later.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.180
So I'd say if you
want, you could either

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.350
add an m0 up there,
or get rid of this m0,

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:06.300
depending on what you like.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.270
But broadly there's this idea
that we have this many nodes,

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:14.262
and this many of them were
added for some time t.

01:02:14.262 --> 01:02:16.470
And that's how we get this
m squared t over k squared

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:20.040
was just that time t divided
by the total number of nodes.

01:02:23.199 --> 01:02:24.990
And this whole discussion
about whether you

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:26.479
count the initial
m0 nodes or not,

01:02:26.479 --> 01:02:28.020
it doesn't matter
because we're going

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.590
to take the limit as
t goes to infinity,

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:30.548
and that all goes away.

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.000
Are there questions about this?

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:44.360
There is something kind of mind
twisting about this argument,

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.890
even though we're really just
picking big T objects out

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:53.357
of essentially little t objects,
but somehow something funny

01:02:53.357 --> 01:02:53.940
goes on there.

01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:02.347
Any questions about that?

01:03:02.347 --> 01:03:05.700
AUDIENCE: Could you just go
through the argument one more

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.200
time?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
sure, sure Right so

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.330
I think that what's confusing
about it is the fact that we're

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:18.970
asking whether the i-th node
was added before some time t.

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:22.890
And this time t is equal
to something that's funny

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.100
based on what we've just done.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:32.560
But it's useful to just
ask, if at time little t

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.000
you look at this
network and I ask

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.760
you, all right, was it
added before this time,

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.130
big T. Let's just
for concreteness

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:45.480
say m0 is equal to--
we start with 10 nodes.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.710
And we say, OK, at time t
equal to 100, I ask you,

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.880
what's the probability that if
I grab a random node, what's

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.050
the probability it was
added before some time

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:57.555
big T equal 10.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:07.800
Well you would say,
very roughly actually.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.520
We can say let's actually,
we can even if you'd like,

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.380
say we're not going to count--
we're not going to count

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.530
those m0 initial nodes.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.613
So we're just going to be
looking at nodes that we

01:04:16.613 --> 01:04:17.790
added later, if you'd like.

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.810
And then when you would say,
all right well, at time t 100,

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:23.320
we've added 100 nodes.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.640
And I'm asking, if I grab
one of the nodes, what's

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.360
the probability that the node I
grab was added in the first 10

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.900
time steps.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.400
Well you'd say, it's
going to be 10%,

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.070
because there were 10 nodes that
were added before time big T,

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:41.824
and we added 100, so it's really
just this divided by this.

01:04:41.824 --> 01:04:43.990
And with the question of
whether you want to include

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:46.990
m0's or not.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:53.210
So I think that that argument
is surprisingly straightforward,

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:56.900
but somehow it gets
really confusing is

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.600
that the time t we're referring
it's depending on the k's

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.960
and t's and so forth.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.450
But that's a way
of keeping track

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.600
of how are things scaling
as a function of time.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.540
But if you boil the
argument down to this,

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.640
then it makes sense,
but then of course

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.730
then you look back at this and
you get confused you again.

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:20.280
Which is how I feel every year
when I prepare this lecture,

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.840
but I think it all does
make sense if you--

01:05:27.317 --> 01:05:29.400
Any questions about this
argument or that argument

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.980
or any part of it?

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.742
Yes?

01:05:32.742 --> 01:05:34.950
AUDIENCE: So the ti's are
very important [INAUDIBLE]?

01:05:38.245 --> 01:05:38.870
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:48.639
So this is just saying that
if I pick some random node,

01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:49.930
we're calling it the i-th node.

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.362
I'm asking what's the
probability that the time that

01:05:52.362 --> 01:05:54.460
was added was before something.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.770
So this is not one
of the variables,

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.760
and you'll see the ti
doesn't appear down here.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.870
Because this is just
saying-- I'm asking you,

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.877
if I grab some random
node, the i-th node.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.460
I'm asking you,
what's the probability

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.800
that it was added before some
other time, which is all this.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:14.290
And what you can see is that
it's a function of the time

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:19.590
that we look, because
if I go to longer times

01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:23.880
you know then indeed this
probability should it go--

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.478
What should it do?

01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:27.394
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:27.394 --> 01:06:31.975
PROFESSOR: OK, but it depends
on k's as well, right?

01:06:31.975 --> 01:06:33.466
What do I want to say?

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:47.300
Ultimately what we see here
is that as time goes infinity,

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.780
so after a long
time, then we reach

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.910
this stationary
distribution where

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:53.430
the base structure
of the network

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:55.920
is not changing anymore.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.510
And that's because there's
a t in both the numerator

01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:59.340
and denominator.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.230
So then the only
thing that is left

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:05.294
is this behavior
as a function of k.

01:07:05.294 --> 01:07:07.210
And this is really saying
that the probability

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:11.420
that some node was
added before some time,

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.980
is kind of the same
as saying that,

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.942
well, that you have
a lot of edges.

01:07:17.942 --> 01:07:19.650
And that's how we got
here to begin with,

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:22.190
because the nodes that
were added early end up

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:23.600
with a lot of edges.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.320
This is the so-called rich
get richer phenomenon.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.607
So if you're sitting
on a manuscript,

01:07:29.607 --> 01:07:31.440
and you're not submitting
it for publication

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.060
you should get on it
because the earlier

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.220
that it's published the more
citations it's going to get.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.080
But this is saying
that the probability

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:46.540
that some random node has
a small number of edges

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.170
is the same as that
the probability

01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:50.835
that the node was added late.

01:07:53.285 --> 01:07:55.285
And that makes sense,
because if it's added late

01:07:55.285 --> 01:07:58.670
it doesn't have very many
edges, hasn't had time to grow.

01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:03.170
And then from those
calculations you

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.730
get it at this
degree distribution.

01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:09.149
Yes?

01:08:09.149 --> 01:08:13.077
AUDIENCE: So for this
analytical [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:13.077 --> 01:08:16.023
we're assuming the links
could be [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:20.785 --> 01:08:21.410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.660
So we're taking, in principle
it's a discrete problem

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.550
and converting it into
a differential equation.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:30.710
And it's an interesting
question of I

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:35.680
don't know how big of an
error this ends up making,

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.950
and of course this
expression doesn't actually

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.640
end up having integers.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.180
But this is a way of making
it so that the errors don't

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.090
grow or so, right?

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:51.350
I think that it basically works.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.069
If you'd like you could actually
do the simulation with all

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:55.430
the discrete-- I
think that is actually

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.388
going to be the stochastic
dynamics that end up

01:08:57.388 --> 01:09:02.080
being more relevant than
the integer kind of issue,

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.533
but I haven't actually
looked into that though.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:13.840
Any other questions
about that so far?

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.367
Yes?

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:15.283
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:22.420
PROFESSOR: So there's no loss
of edges, no loss of nodes,

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.520
strictly verboten.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:31.970
I spent a lot of
time trying to plan

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:37.148
an upcoming trip to Germany last
night so German is on my mind.

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:47.870
So are we done yet incidentally?

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:48.910
Nearly right?

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:51.790
Because we have--
What we really wanted

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:56.130
is the degree distribution,
not this probability.

01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:58.770
So we have to take
a derivative still,

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:04.120
but as t goes to
infinity, regardless

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.320
of how you treat the m0's,
actually what we-- maybe we'll

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.630
take the derivative first.

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:14.730
So this probability
density is going

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:17.500
to be the derivative
with respect

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.030
to k of the actual
probability here.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.460
So we take a derivative,
this one derivative

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.370
that nothing happens,
case squared,

01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:36.690
it's going to turn
into a k cubed.

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:44.200
So we get 2m squared
t over k cubed,

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:52.110
we still have the t plus m0, but
when we let t go to infinity,

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:58.550
so after this thing has reached
its stationary distribution,

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:02.370
then we end up just getting
2m squared over k cubed.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:08.490
I just want to be
clear this is to the k.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:14.050
The key feature here is that
the probability distribution

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:16.920
goes as 1 over k cubed.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.430
What is interesting is that
when I first read the paper

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:31.260
I actually thought
that this exponent here

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.910
would be a function
of the linearity

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:36.160
of the preferential attachment.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.360
So I actually-- and of course
they say that it's not true,

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.020
but when I was halfway through
the paper I thought, oh well,

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.490
if you just let this go
as some power to the beta,

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.900
or so, that you would
maybe get something

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.580
like this was 2 plus
beta-- I thought

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.990
something like that, but
apparently it's not true.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:58.040
That if you do not have
linear attachment here

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.220
then you just don't get
power law distributions.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.053
They suggest other ways
that you could maybe

01:12:02.053 --> 01:12:04.860
get different exponents,
which is very relevant given

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.260
the fact that different
real networks indeed

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.850
have different exponents.

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:13.240
But I'd say that their
proffered explanation, which

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.590
is to include directed edges,
feels unsatisfying because not

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:21.240
all networks are directed.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.530
And this network
here is not directed,

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:26.950
it has next exponents
closer to 2.

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:30.010
So you really want to
have other mechanisms.

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:33.230
But this is as we mentioned,
is it's a thriving field

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:35.474
and people have explored
many different aspects

01:12:35.474 --> 01:12:36.140
of this problem.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.650
Are there any other questions
about this derivation, how

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.562
we got there, how
convincing maybe you

01:12:49.562 --> 01:12:50.770
think it should be or not be?

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.870
So I want to just spend the
last five minutes of the class

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:02.360
kind of setting up the
discussion of how we should be

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.010
searching for network motifs.

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.760
In particular there's
a natural question

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.200
which is, we have to decide
what the right null model is,

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.842
in terms of deciding what the
expected frequency of a network

01:13:14.842 --> 01:13:16.550
motif, like a feed
forward loop might be.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:30.490
So first of all, why is it
that we maybe should not

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:31.890
use an Erdos Renyi network?

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:44.627
Yes?

01:13:44.627 --> 01:13:46.668
AUDIENCE: Because it's
not very good for handling

01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:49.072
directed networks?

01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:49.780
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.460
So you'd say, oh, not
very good-- I can maybe

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:57.960
make-- there's a clear
analog to it-- you could take

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:04.170
a random undirected ER network
and say put arrows randomly

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:08.450
on each-- I mean I think
that there's a natural ER

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:10.710
version of a directed network.

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.455
AUDIENCE: There are constraints.

01:14:12.455 --> 01:14:13.330
PROFESSOR: Like what?

01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:20.092
AUDIENCE: Like when you
[INAUDIBLE] duplication,

01:14:20.092 --> 01:14:23.291
you don't randomly
assign the edge.

01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.290
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:27.030
OK, so one thing is that it
may be that biologically there

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:31.010
are constraints, but that
should manifest itself somehow.

01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:34.040
In the sense that if, you know
all that may be well and good,

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.410
it may be true, what
you're saying, but if we go

01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:38.160
and we look at a
transcription network,

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.160
if it looks like an
ER network, then I

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160
would say it just
doesn't matter.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.240
The fact that there's
microscopic things going on,

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.740
I mean if at the end of the day
it looks like an ER network,

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.047
then maybe it's
fine anyways, right?

01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:54.480
AUDIENCE: Hum.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.380
PROFESSOR: Or maybe not.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.477
You can argue either way.

01:14:58.477 --> 01:15:00.060
AUDIENCE: It depends
on what you want.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.370
If a particular
motif occurs a lot

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:06.814
it might be because
it's selected for it,

01:15:06.814 --> 01:15:09.230
but it's not what you were--
--it's for some other reason.

01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:10.229
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:13.290
So this is an
important point, that I

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:15.200
would say that in
Erdos approach,

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.389
he basically says if we
see a network motif more

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:19.930
frequently than we
would expect based

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.590
on some null model,
some null network,

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:24.850
then it's kind of
prima facie evidence

01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:26.815
that maybe evolution
was selecting

01:15:26.815 --> 01:15:28.480
for it for some reason.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.180
And what you're saying is
that it could be there's

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.040
a microscopic mechanism
that just leads

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.690
to those things happening,
and so it doesn't

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:37.590
have to be selection,
it could be

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:40.980
just due to the mechanistic
processes below.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:43.150
And I think that's
a fair concern.

01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:45.890
And it's related to a lot of
these other things, in that

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:48.020
just for example,
duplication will naturally

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:52.470
lead to something-- if you
start out with x regulating Y,

01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.710
and Y is duplicated then
now you have x regulating

01:15:55.710 --> 01:16:00.440
some Y1 and also some Y2.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.050
And this is the beginnings
of a network motif,

01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:07.270
and so it's a reasonable
thing to worry about

01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:10.570
but maybe we can correct for
at least a majority of this

01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:12.280
by using the proper null model.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.380
At least that would be the hope.

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.516
AUDIENCE: Well, that's why
you don't want necessiarilly--

01:16:19.516 --> 01:16:20.640
PROFESSOR: OK, that's fair.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.130
But then the question is,
what you null model should we

01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:25.420
be using?

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.522
Yeah?

01:16:26.522 --> 01:16:28.605
AUDIENCE: So you
feel like having

01:16:28.605 --> 01:16:31.585
the microscopic constraints
does not necessarily

01:16:31.585 --> 01:16:33.510
need to be in the null model.

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:36.738
I feel we can have a null
model but without using

01:16:36.738 --> 01:16:39.690
the microscopic constraints
and then just say, oh well

01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:41.430
that's another
possibility for why we

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.969
might have these divergences.

01:16:43.969 --> 01:16:45.968
I don't think they need
to be in the null model.

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.258
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's just that
then you can't say anything

01:16:48.258 --> 01:16:48.924
about evolution.

01:16:48.924 --> 01:16:51.090
AUDIENCE: Well fair,
but I don't should

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.270
have to-- I don't think
you have to say something

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:55.420
about evolution
afterwards necessarily.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.378
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and I
think that this question

01:16:57.378 --> 01:17:00.030
about how strongly you can
argue that evolution, selective

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:03.180
or something, and this is a
little bit of a judgment call,

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.260
because most of these
evolutionary arguments

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.220
are not ironclad,
it's more a matter

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.650
of making you feel kind of
comfortable with looking

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:16.670
for what the evolutionary
explanation might have been.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:21.560
This is just the nature of
looking at historical science,

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.490
right?

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:24.217
I mean, you can
speculate about what

01:17:24.217 --> 01:17:26.550
would have happened if Napoleon
had done something else,

01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:27.050
or whatever.

01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:30.380
But it's a speculation.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.540
Of course the hope is
that we can collect

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.959
multiple pieces of evidence
that make us more and more

01:17:34.959 --> 01:17:36.500
comfortable with it
and in some cases

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.290
we can do laboratory
evolution to get more comfort,

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:41.590
but laboratory
evolution doesn't prove

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:45.300
that that's what happened
a million years ago either.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.770
But I'd say it's more the
accumulation of evidence

01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:51.470
to make you feel comfortable
with an argument.

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:53.730
But you know, let's first
make sure we understand

01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:58.809
what the null model is, and
then on Thursday we'll decide,

01:17:58.809 --> 01:18:00.850
well we won't decide,
we'll discuss what we think

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:01.974
that means about evolution.

01:18:01.974 --> 01:18:02.870
Yeah?

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:08.517
AUDIENCE: So I think what we
the other part of the appendix

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.475
that we read about the
in and out distributions

01:18:10.475 --> 01:18:12.060
is important for the null model.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.685
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:18:12.685 --> 01:18:17.388
AUDIENCE: Because it seems
to me that the Erdos Renyi

01:18:17.388 --> 01:18:23.292
network might be a good model
for the in distributions,

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:24.770
but not for the
out distributions.

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:27.529
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:18:27.529 --> 01:18:29.070
And I think this is
really important.

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:32.330
I think that it's clear that
the actual transcription

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:35.270
network of E. coli, for
example, is not well described

01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:37.780
as an Erdos Renyi
random network,

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.310
but then it does beg the
question of what should we

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:41.590
be using.

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:44.566
And you could say, well, we
just make a power law network,

01:18:44.566 --> 01:18:45.940
but then you say,
oh, but there's

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.420
the in degree, and
the out degree.

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.400
How much do you want
to keep track of that?

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.152
And I think that there is
a fairly strong argument

01:18:53.152 --> 01:18:54.860
that what you should
do is what they call

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.540
this degree preserving network.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:07.610
In particular what that means is
that you take the real network,

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:09.360
so you take the actual
network that you're

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:15.650
going to be analyzing, and
there is some actual degree

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.140
distribution.

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:25.805
So there's 1 node has-- so k1
might be 106, k2 might be 73,

01:19:25.805 --> 01:19:30.040
dot, dot, dot, dot, up to
kn which is equal to 1.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.520
And of course I'm
not even talking

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.603
about it being directed,
but you do the same thing

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.526
with directed.

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:37.650
But then what you do, is
you kind of mix things up.

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.358
So you start with a
real network and then

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:42.522
you do something
to randomize it.

01:19:42.522 --> 01:19:44.230
And it's a rather
clever scheme, I'm just

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:45.470
going to describe
it briefly here

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.386
and then we'll talk more
about it on Thursday.

01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:51.210
What you do is you take
all of the actual--

01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:57.580
so let's say we have x1, some
x2 and here we have a Y1,

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:03.790
Y2, Y3, now let's say that these
guys are regulating something

01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:05.230
like this.

01:20:05.230 --> 01:20:09.520
What you do is you take
two edges randomly,

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.880
we'll pick this one
that one, and what we do

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.570
is we swap the targets.

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:19.660
So what we do is we make
this guy come over here,

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.440
and then this one
comes over here.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.240
So now what we do is we erase
this, and we erase this,

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:33.670
now we have a new network,
but intriguingly, the degree

01:20:33.670 --> 01:20:36.170
distributions for both
incoming and outgoing edges

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:41.000
are identical to what
we had before this.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.290
Every guy has the outgoing
edges, incoming edges,

01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:47.120
but they're just
different targets.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.710
So if you just do
this procedure many,

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:51.960
many times then
what you do is you

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.929
achieve some randomized
version of the real network.

01:20:55.929 --> 01:20:58.470
And then what you can do is you
can ask how many feed forward

01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:59.360
loops are there.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.700
How many, this, that--

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.720
And so there's a fair
argument that this

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.182
is in some ways the
proper null model

01:21:08.182 --> 01:21:09.390
to be asking the question in.

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:10.100
And indeed, for
example, there are

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.600
many more feed forward loops
than there would be in an Erdos

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.421
Renyi, but still what you see is
that you lose many feed forward

01:21:16.421 --> 01:21:16.920
loop.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.870
So this then the
argument for feed

01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:21.270
forward loops
being selected for.

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:24.060
We'll talk about this and
we'll quantify it on Thursday,

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.180
but I'm available for
the next half hour

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.090
if anybody has any questions.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.823
PROFESSOR: OK, good afternoon.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.820
So this week we talk
about quantum gases,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.930
ultra-cold atomic gases.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.080
And sure, they're ideal Bose
gases, ideal Fermi gases,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.360
but I will spend one
or two minutes on each,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.740
because that's exactly solvable.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.250
It's in all the textbooks.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.560
That's simple.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.700
Quantum gases become interesting
because of interactions.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.610
And in my lecture today
and my last lecture

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.070
I want to introduce you
to Bose gases and Fermi

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.110
gases with inter actions.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.180
And they both turn superfluid,
and the superfluid properties

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.800
are determined by the
interactions between the atoms.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.110
So the purpose of those
lectures is number one,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.740
to acquaint to you with
important phenomena

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.690
in cold gases-- superfluidity,
superfluidity in lattices,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.090
superfluidity just in
free gas, in a normal gas

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.270
without lattice, and
superfluidity of fermions.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.090
But at the same
time, I also want

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.470
to have sort of a theme for you
how we deal with interactions.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.110
And that kind of theme
is how theoretically we

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.400
reduce unsolvable
Hamiltonians to Hamiltonians

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.850
which can be solved.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.170
And you will see that
actually appearing

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.240
in different situations
with similarities,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.220
but important differences.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.110
So just to remind
you, we started out

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.210
with the interacting Bose
gas in a homogeneous system.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.615
We have a very general
way to describe

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:09.250
scattering two particles with
initial momentum disappear

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.760
and two particles
with momenta appear.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.320
This is a scattering event.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.750
Now this means we have products
of four operators, which

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.760
is very difficult to solve.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.690
And the Bogoliubov approximation
which we discussed on Monday

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.420
replaces the operator for
the condensate for the zero

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.900
momentum state with a Z number,
saying that N 0, N 0 plus 1

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.180
is the same-- a little
bit waving your hands.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.410
But it's also you can say
the macroscopic limit when

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.250
we have a photon field
with many, many photons,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.650
we can use a Z number
in our Hamiltonian

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.650
to describe the electric field.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.520
So that's the same spirit.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.470
So maybe I should emphasize it.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.090
This is for atoms.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.121
What you're used to do with
photons for your whole life.

00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:56.620
OK.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.060
With that we have
transformed the Hamiltonian

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.740
into a bilinear expression.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.920
And so at the moment your
bilinear expression--

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.720
you do a Bogoliubov
transformation.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.110
You simply diagonalize it by
finding a new set operators

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.320
where the cross term
between a and b or between a

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.240
of k and a of minus k disappear.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.340
And then you've solved it.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.350
And this is what we arrived at
at the end of the last lecture.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.700
With those
approximations, we have

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.250
diagonalized the Hamiltonian.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.650
Our Hamiltonian is now, you
can say harmonic oscillator

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.040
Hamiltonian, or
you can see it has

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.430
become a gas of non-interacting
quasi particles.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.620
Each of those operators
creates a quasi particle,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.360
and the quasi particle
energy is U of k.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.880
And I explained to
you that as expected,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.070
the quasi particle
energy is simply

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.710
particles with momentum
h-bar k for high momenta,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.460
because in high excitation
of Bose quantums

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.000
it is a free particle.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.400
But a low-lying excitation
is affected in a major way

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.880
by all of these
interactions with

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.610
the Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.880
And that turns the quadratic
dispersion relation

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.350
into a linear one,
or you can say

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.500
that turns the free particle
into a photon or something.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.890
So that's my review
of the last class.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.050
Are there any questions
before we go further?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.740
Colin.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.073
AUDIENCE: Does this require
low density and [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:34.267
or one or the other?

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:36.850
PROFESSOR: We come a little bit
later to that, but in the end,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.500
there is a small parameter.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.790
The small parameter will be N
a cubed-- the gas parameter--

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.090
N, the density, a cubed,
the scattering length.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.960
It's usually the dimensionless
combination of the two

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.940
which decides whether we are
in the weakly or strongly

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.670
interacting limit.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.180
There is another assumption
which we have made here,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.560
but it's related to that-- as
you will see a few moments--

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.010
that most of the are
in the condensate.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.620
We assumed N0 is peak.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.500
The condensate depletion-- the
number of atoms which are not

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.630
in the condensate,
t equals 0 is small.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.520
But let me just
first show you-- I

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.080
want to mix in
theory and experiment

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.350
how sound can be observed.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.240
I should actually say this
experiment is sort of dear

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.220
to my heart, because
at some point

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.320
it clicked to me how the
new world of atomic physics

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.550
connects with condensed
matter physics.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.950
Soon after we had realized
Bose-Einstein condensates,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.560
a famous condensed matter
theorist said hey, Wolfgang,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.849
you should now observe sound.

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:38.640
Sound is important.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.580
Yeah, OK, but how do
you observe sound?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.150
You know, use a piezo
and just kick the system

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.550
and create a sound wave.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.130
And I said, oh, gosh, this
guy doesn't know with that

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.280
if you put anything in contact
with the quantum gases--

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.540
a piezo-- the gases
will just stick to it.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.577
He has no idea
what our system is.

00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:57.785
But then I said wait a
moment-- we have to translate.

00:05:57.785 --> 00:05:59.820
He says use a piezo.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.100
Well, I have to translate.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.840
In atomic physics
how do we kick atoms?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.620
With a laser beam.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.720
And in that moment,
I had the idea

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.110
that we can take a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.970
suddenly switch on a blue
de-tuned repulsive laser beam.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.980
This will do exactly as a
piezo-- create a density

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.630
perturbation, and then
the density perturbation

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.600
will propagate with
the speed of sound.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.720
And that worked.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.030
That was just when Bose-Einstein
condensations were very fresh.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.910
One of the first
scientific experiments

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.230
done-- we switch on
the laser and you

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.520
see color-coded in red the
density perturbation which

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.080
propagates out of it.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.580
And the slope of this line
is the speed of sound.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.090
And here we determined
the speed of sound

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.380
as a function of density.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.840
So that's how phonons--
or at least how

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.180
the speed of sound
and wave packets which

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.750
propagate with the speed
of sound can be prepared.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.880
I come back to phonons
and collective excitations

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.830
in a few moments.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.385
But let me first say
when we have diagonalized

00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:08.890
the Hamiltonian we know
everything we want to know.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.720
I just focused on the
quasi particle energies,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.330
but you also know the
ground-state energy.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.300
And actually here Colin,
you see that the corrections

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.340
to the ground-state
energy scale with N

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.070
a cubed, so this is really the
small parameter in this system.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.060
But we can also find out what is
the ground state wave function.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.880
And let me use it to introduce
an important concept to you

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.940
called the quantum depletion.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.890
When you have two atoms in the
condensator at zero momentum

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.510
and you switch on
the interactions,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.265
the delta function interaction
couples zero momentum state

00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:50.740
to higher momentum states.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.850
So therefore, the
effect of interactions

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.840
is that the condensate is
not just at zero momentum.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.010
It has some probability,
or some admixture,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.000
of finite momentum states.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.120
This is the ground state.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.400
This is how the Hamiltonian
is diagonalized.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.385
So from the Bogoliubov
approximation,

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:12.130
where we introduced
this V and U parameter

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.890
to transfer from one
set of Bose operators

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.150
to another set of
Bose operators,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.260
those coefficients
give us the population

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.410
of those momentum states in the
[INAUDIBLE] of the condensate.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.310
So if I now ask, what is
the condensate fraction?

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.070
What is the number of atoms
in the zero momentum states?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.669
It's all atoms, but those
who have finite momentum.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:39.330
And we find again the
small parameter N a cubed.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.190
Now this quantum
depletion allows me now

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.280
to make a distinction
between the cold atomic gas

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.440
condensates and
superfluid helium form.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.480
In cold atomic gas condensates,
this correction is about 1%.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.430
So therefore, I can say
with 99% probability,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.410
or with 99% weight,
the condensate,

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.790
the many-body wave
function of the condensate

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.200
is just the zero momentum
state to the power N.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.030
And this very complicated
admixture of correlation

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:19.800
into the ideal gas wave function
is only 1% for alkali gases.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.160
But for liquid helium,
the condensate fraction--

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.030
even at zero
temperature-- is only 10%.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.930
So when people use
neutron scattering--

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.870
it would be a long story in
itself how this is done--

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.850
but when they use neutron
scattering to analyze

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.060
the liquid helium
at low temperature,

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.640
and figure out what is the
fraction of atoms which

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.370
have zero momentum,
they found 10%.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.700
The quantum depletion is 90%.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.150
But that's just the
difference between a quantum

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.310
gas and a quantum liquid.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.880
And in the quantum liquid--
in liquid helium-- N

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.915
a cubed is on the
order of unity.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.370
OK, I mentioned this
dispersion relation.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.920
These are sort of
quasi particles.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.820
And I at least
showed you how you

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.260
can measure the slope of the
quasi particle dispersion

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.000
relation by propagating
sound waves.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.300
But let me now tell you how we
can observe quasi particles'

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.290
elementary excitations directly.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.710
And this is actually simply
done by light scattering.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:32.940
If you scatter a photon,
and the scattered photon

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.720
loses energy h-bar U. And
it is scattered at an angle.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.860
Therefore, it
transfers momentum q.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.910
These forces can
only happen if there

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:52.510
is an elementary excitation
with momentum q and energy h U.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.280
So in other words,
on a photon basis,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.270
you can see photon
by photon, if you

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.860
scatter a photon, the photon
transfers momentum and energy.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.290
The process can only happen if
you can form a quasiparticle

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.680
with this momentum and energy.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.330
So since this is sort of the
direct way of mapping out

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.320
whether the system
has the possibility

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:19.744
to absorb momentum q and energy
h nu, this has sort of a name.

00:11:19.744 --> 00:11:22.160
The scattering probability is
called the dynamic structure

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.660
factor.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.680
And the dynamic structure
factor is just an integral

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.550
over all the possibilities
that a many-body system can

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.690
absorb momentum and energy.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:38.730
Now there is one
nice feature which

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.802
was introduced by
us at MIT, and that

00:11:40.802 --> 00:11:43.260
is if you're going to measure
the dynamic structure factor,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.926
often you do it with
neutron scattering.

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:48.230
You scatter neutrons or x-rays
and they scatter spontaneously

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.870
at an angle, and
you need a detector

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.430
to detect the
scattered particles.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.470
But in our case, because
the gas is so dilute,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.670
the distance between
atoms is on the order

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.240
of the optical wavelengths.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.350
We don't want neutrons.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.570
We don't want x-rays.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.690
We want photons, because
the wavelengths of photons

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.850
is perfectly matched
to the properties,

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.260
to momentum transfer and
such we need for our system.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.200
But photons-- we
have photon lasers.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.920
So instead of in a painstakingly
way analyzing the frequency

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.140
and the momentum of
scattered photons,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.360
we don't do the spontaneous
scattering process.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.180
We do a stimulated process.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.425
We use two laser beams,
and we stimulate a photon

00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:34.320
to be scattered into
the other laser beam.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.490
And by having the two laser
beams at frequency difference

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.690
delta omega, we're
really asking the system,

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.580
are you ready to absorb
delta omega energy?

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.330
If yes, then you
have a quasiparticle.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.090
So this is how we do
quasiparticle spectroscopy.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.820
And a few years
later, this method

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:58.310
was defined by the
[INAUDIBLE] Institute.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.630
And what you see
here is they varied

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.380
the angles between the
two laser beams, realized

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.370
different momentum
transfer, and what

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.190
you see is the low dispersion,
the linear dispersion

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.200
relation for low
momenta, and then

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.970
the quadratic part
at high momentum.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.340
So this is called
BEC spectroscopy.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.060
It's a variant, you can see,
of Raman spectroscopy where

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.530
you go from a zero quasiparticle
state to a one quasiparticle

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.830
state through a
simulated Raman process,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.875
and this is how the dispersion
relation is determined.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.820
OK so I've so far
dealt with aspects

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.200
of a homogeneous Bose-Einstein
condensate where,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.250
of course, if you're
a homogeneous system,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.590
you formulate everything
in momentum space.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.090
But now we want to
deal with the situation

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.640
that our condensates
are finite in size.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.990
And in addition, they're
usually in a harmonic oscillator

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:08.020
potential, and therefore their
density is inhomogeneous.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:13.350
Let me start the discussion with
the inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.440
condensate by showing
again a picture which

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.900
brings in some
memories of '90, '96.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.130
It was the first
time that we could

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.850
see the Bose-Einstein
condensate in the trap.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.820
Before people have just
seen it by time of flight

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.900
when it was pretty
much already destroyed

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.040
or it was just flying out.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.980
But here we see the trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.870
and we could even
take multiple pictures

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.280
of the same condensate.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.380
So you can see that
this was the first time

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.080
that a condensate
was seen alive.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.260
What you see here is actually
the bimodal distribution.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.400
You see the condensate and
then due to speckled pattern,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.640
the Fermi cloud
looks fragmented,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.395
but this is just a
speckled pattern due

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:58.400
to the signal to noise.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.740
But here you really see now--
not in ballistic expansion

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.030
as I showed you on Monday--
but really insight to the size

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.860
and shape of the condensate.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.380
OK, how do we describe it?

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.920
Well, the message is pretty
much exactly the same way

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.010
as we did with the Bogoliubov
approximation and such,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.970
but instead of in
momentum space,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.960
we do it now in position space.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.720
Actually, I have
to say this week,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.370
I go through a lot of material.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.960
But what I'm trying
is to give you

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.780
sort of a spirited
and animated overview

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.730
that you really know
what is important.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.260
Where is the same
concept appearing again

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.300
in a different way.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.590
The details-- I've
posted, actually,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.687
the original
articles, references.

00:15:44.687 --> 00:15:46.270
Some of are school
notes, some of them

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.490
written by myself
on the backside.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.180
So yes, it's a little
bit different character

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.680
than other lectures.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.750
I want to show you
a lot of things,

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:59.160
and put a special
emphasis on the ideas.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.850
OK, so in second
quantization, we

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.270
are now using field operators
which create and annihilate

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.460
particles at position R.
This is the single particle

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.400
Hamiltonian-- kinetic
energy and potential energy.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.720
And our interaction term has
now, again, four operators--

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.740
two interrelation operators,
two creation operators,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.460
but they're now formulated
in position space.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.730
We do exactly the same as we
did in the homogeneous gas.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.590
We assume the potential
is short range.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.130
That means delta function.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.040
And that means we
can get rid of one

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.670
of the integrations
in r and r prime.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:44.430
But we still have product
of four operators.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.490
We can formally solve the
equation by writing down

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.090
Heisenberg's situation for the
equation of motion for those

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.620
field operators, but of
course this cannot be solved.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.090
Remember products are
four operators are hard.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.280
We have to reduce
it to two operators.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.829
And this is actually done by the
Bogoliubov approximation again.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.740
But it's done here
in the following way.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:16.390
Remember, in the momentum space
we replaced a0 and a0 dagger

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.750
by the square root of a0.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:24.160
What we do here is we say this
is sort of a quantum field.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:31.010
And when we have a superfluid,
this field operator

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.790
has an average value.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.580
It's actually the macroscopic
superfluid order parameter.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.720
So we replace the operator
by an average value

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.860
which we assume is large,
because many, many particles

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.110
are in the superfluid state.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.220
And then we have
fluctuations which are small.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.430
And what we will do is-- it's
pretty clear-- when it comes

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.000
to the fluctuations, we will
neglect higher products--

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.060
products of four
fluctuation operators.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.605
And we are down to C
numbers and, as you

00:18:02.605 --> 00:18:04.260
will see, two operators.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.960
We can-- and this is
even more dramatic--

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.850
it wouldn't make sense
in momentum space,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.870
but it does make sense
in position space--

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.340
we can even do a
first approximation

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.470
where we completely
neglect those fluctuations.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.190
And then what we have
is when we simply

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:28.600
insert a [? Z ?] number
into this Hamiltonian.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.310
We have then an equation
for this number,

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.870
for this function psi.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.600
And this is the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.730
or it's also called
Gross-Pitaevskii equation,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.990
which is now the analogy
to Schrodinger's equation,

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.000
but now for the macroscopic
wave function which

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.250
is occupied by many,
many particles.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.470
And in addition to
the kinetic energy

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.760
and the trapping potential
in the external potential,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.740
it has a term which is
proportional to the density.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.620
And this is just
mean field repulsion

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.060
which one atom feels
exerted by the other atoms.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.080
I should say--
just to connect it

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.250
to what I've said earlier
about the quantum depletion--

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.740
that you can regard the
function psi as the best

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.340
approximation to an ideal
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.470
So if you want to write
your many-body wave

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.300
function as a function
psi to the power N,

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.350
all particles are in
the same quantum state,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.720
then a variational
calculation would

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.960
say that this function psi
should obey this equation.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.560
If you want to read
up what I've said,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.150
I've posted a recent paper,
which I found very pedagogical,

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:53.510
where they derive the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.570
without even using an
operator psi dagger,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.940
without using any
second quantization.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.810
They just say we have an
Hamiltonian for an interaction

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:08.780
system, and we try to write
the complicated, many-body wave

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.810
function as a wave
function to the power N.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.250
And then you put this
ansatz into your Hamiltonian

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.330
and do a variation optimization
which single-particle wave

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.020
function psi, if
taken to the power N,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.220
minimizes the total
energy of N particles,

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.970
including interactions.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.500
And the answer is this equation.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.160
So there are many
ways this equation

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.200
is sort of very natural.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.510
Now you all know about
single-particle physics--

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.640
kinetic energy in an
external potential.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.310
Let's now learn what this
density-dependent term does.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.220
Well, it's pretty clear.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.650
There is a price to
be paid for density.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.330
And while the total
integrated density, of course,

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.600
is given by the total
number of particles.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.460
That means if you lower
the density somewhere,

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.890
you have to increase
the density.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.350
But because this is
a non-linear term,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.090
if you have an average
density and you lower it

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.340
here and increase it here, you
have actually more repulsive

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.170
energy than if the
density is flat.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.780
So this term has only one goal.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.660
It wants to flatten
out densities.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.530
So therefore if we
have a box potential

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.240
and you know the
ground state in a box

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.180
is just half a period
of a sine function.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.964
This is a non-interacting
condensate.

00:21:41.964 --> 00:21:43.380
This would be the
macroscopic wave

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.810
function in a box potential.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.360
But if you now put in
strong interactions,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.290
the strong interaction's going
to flatten out the potential.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.190
They flatten out the
potential, and only at the very

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.570
last moment-- all
right, now it's

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.550
time to go down because we have
to meet our boundary condition.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.520
And the length scale where
you eventually go down-- it

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.100
has a famous name,
the healing length--

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.720
is the length scale
where the kinetic energy

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.080
due to the curvature
of the wave function

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.330
is now comparable to
the interaction energy.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.560
If the system would
curve down earlier,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.130
it would cause too
much repulsive energy,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.150
because the density
is not kept flat.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.280
If it would curve down too
late, the enormous curvature

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.020
would mean a lot
of kinetic energy.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.520
And this is just
the best compromise

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.570
between those two criteria.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.150
So that's how you derive
the healing length.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.580
The healing length is
now the length scale

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:45.010
over which the system is willing
to meet boundary conditions,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.080
and not stay flat,
as flat as possible.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.845
Yes.

00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:51.594
AUDIENCE: Just curious--
in that equation,

00:22:51.594 --> 00:22:57.180
the atom has the mass
of each individual--

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.476
PROFESSOR: The mass is
the mass of a single atom.

00:22:59.476 --> 00:23:02.260
AUDIENCE: Single atom,
it's not-- sorry,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.260
I wasn't here last time.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.580
But the quasiparticles are
the same mass [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.880
PROFESSOR: In a Bose-Einstein
condensate they are.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.070
We haven't changed the mass.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.350
But we're not talking
actually about quasiparticle.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:18.810
We're actually really talking
about here qualitative features

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.020
of the solution of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.670
And the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.990
is sort of a single particle
equation for particles of mass,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:32.650
of the original bare mass
M. It's a macroscopic wave

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.520
function, but I sometimes say
it describes the wave function

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.520
of a single particle where
all the other particles are

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.610
included at the
mean field level.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.120
So therefore, it is really
this, the atomic mass,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.460
and not any form of
collective mass here.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.640
Well, if you would now
ask how do interactions

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:56.510
transform the first excited
state in the box potential?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.410
Well, then it's again flat
this as much as possible.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.760
But then if you want to
maintain the parity of the wave

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.430
function, then it's
only close to the zero

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.570
crossing within a healing length
that the system says OK, now I

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.360
change sign.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.080
So that's sort of what is inside
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.440
Now once we realize that, we
can take it to the next level

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.781
and say, well, if you
neglect-- let's say

00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:28.280
we're interested
in the ground state

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.530
and we neglect this
boundary region where

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.130
the kinetic energy
becomes important-- maybe

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.920
we can simplify the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.846
by neglecting the
kinetic energy.

00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:43.580
If potential energy dominates
by far, we can neglect that.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.670
And then we should
get a good description

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.510
which will not be valid in
the wings of the wave function

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.210
but in most of space.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.941
But now if you look
at this equation,

00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:56.565
it's no longer a
differential equation.

00:24:56.565 --> 00:24:58.120
It has no derivatives.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.530
It's just something
which applies

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.500
to the wave function psi itself.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.140
And we can simply solve that.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.580
The solution of that
is that psi squared--

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.370
the density-- is
nothing else than there

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:20.000
is a constant minus the
inverted trapping potential.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.550
So therefore in this
Thomas-Fermi approximation

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.390
where we neglect the
kinetic energy completely,

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.010
you just take your trapping
potential, turn it upside down,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.790
and then you fill
it up with density

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.500
until you have accommodated
the number of atoms

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.890
you want to accommodate.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.084
And this is, of
course-- the constraint

00:25:41.084 --> 00:25:43.250
in the number of atoms is
determined by the chemical

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.490
potential.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.100
Or if you have a more
complicated W-shaped potential,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.420
the same construction.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:54.070
Flip it over, fill it up,
gives you the condensate wave

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.180
function, the
density distribution

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.150
of the condensate
in this potential.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.940
I don't want to belabor
it, but coming back

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.680
to the question of
the small parameter,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.240
if you look at
those equations, you

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.290
can identify a parameter-- this
is now the small parameter,

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.060
or the parameter
in the system which

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.030
is the important
dimensionless parameter.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.950
It depends on the
number of atoms,

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.470
and it depends now on the ratio
of the scattering length--

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.590
which characterizes
the interaction--

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.860
and the harmonic
oscillator length.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.520
You can say the
harmonic oscillator

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.720
length is the ideal wave
function harmonic oscillator.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.790
So this parametrizes the
importance of kinetic energy,

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.180
whereas the scattering
length parametrizes

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.160
the importance of interactions.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.930
And all those solutions
can be nicely written

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.750
as what you would
have in an ideal gas,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:59.600
and then this parameter X. So
in typical experiments, N a,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.871
N is a million.

00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:03.370
The scattering length is smaller
than the oscillator length,

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.440
but N is a million, and this
parameter X is usually large.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.370
So therefore-- and I'm
simply just talking

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.840
about this solution-- we have
the situation that the chemical

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.720
potential is larger
by a power of X

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.400
than the ideal gas solution,
which would just be the ground

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.910
state with its zero point energy
in the harmonic oscillator

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:31.620
potential, or the width-- the
size-- of the wave function

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.690
is larger than the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:40.100
but only with an exponent,
which is one-fifth.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.290
Well, we can see that.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.580
These are now, again,
somewhat improved pictures

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.670
of condensates inside the trap.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.860
For the expert, the
previous picture

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.160
was dark-ground imaging.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.960
This is now
phase-contrast imaging.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.510
And if you take a
profile, we clearly

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:02.370
see the condensate wave function
and we see the thermal wings.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:07.450
When we look at the size of
the condensate wave function,

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.594
you realize what I just meant--
that the ground-state wave

00:28:11.594 --> 00:28:13.260
function, the harmonic
oscillator length

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.980
is 7 micron in the
axial direction,

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.650
but here you have 300 micron.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.850
So this condensate is completely
dominated by interactions.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:30.720
And it fulfils very nice, and
pretty much the whole shape,

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.150
except maybe some
details in the wings,

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:40.030
are quantitatively described
by the simple approximation

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.270
I have explained to you.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.020
So just a little
bit show and tell.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.660
We have this
Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.680
The Gross-Pitaevskii equation
has, as Schrodinger's equation,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.320
a time independent form
to get the ground state.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.240
It has also a time
dependent form.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.840
You simply replace the
energy by the derivative

00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.750
of the wave function.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.580
This is the time-dependent form.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.170
Everything is very simple, and
you can do many-body physics,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.991
but on your computer,
you pretty much look

00:29:07.991 --> 00:29:09.365
for single-particle
wave function

00:29:09.365 --> 00:29:11.690
and take them to the power N.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.280
So some areas where the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.820
has quantitatively
explained experiments-- one

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.590
is the expansion of a
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.540
It's this famous
situation when you

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.570
have an elongated condensate
and let it expand.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:31.760
It expands faster in
the radial direction.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.970
One simple argument
is the pressure

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.900
of the mean field is larger and
leads to faster acceleration.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.150
So therefore, if you have
a cigar-shaped condensate

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:45.230
and release it, it
turns into a disk.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.790
It inverts the aspect ratio,
going from a cigar shape

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.030
to a disk shape.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.270
And that has been beautifully
and quantitatively described

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.960
by the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.550
Here we have measured
the interaction energy

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.740
as a number of condensed atoms.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.370
And I mentioned to you that
this X parameter comes often

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.750
with power 1/5 and 2/5.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.154
And this here is a
fit to the power 2/5,

00:30:10.154 --> 00:30:11.570
beautifully
confirming the theory.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.400
So the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation was

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:26.680
invented in 1962, about 50 years
ago by Gross and Pitaevskii

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.260
to describe vortices.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.450
Actually, Lev Pitaevskii
is still alive,

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.200
going strong, and
publishing papers.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.210
One of his latest predictions
was solitons in Fermi gases,

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:46.000
and I know in Professor
Zwierlein's group,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.760
one of his lab just looked
at the same physics,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.440
and compared to the
theory of Lev Pitaevskii.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.610
And this year we
are celebrating--

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.200
I forgot, the 85th or
90th birthday of him.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.866
PROFESSOR: 90?

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:01.990
AUDIENCE: There's a poster.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.180
PROFESSOR: I know there's
a poster next to my door,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.600
but I forgot which anniversary.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.430
So I mean, he's an legend.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.110
But he's still walking.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.750
He's still doing science.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:18.840
So if you meet him, you go
back to 50 years in history.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.700
Anyway, it is this
Lev Pitaevskii,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:27.410
and he invented his equations
to describe vortices.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:32.640
So anyway so we have this
nonlinear Schrodinger equation.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.660
Let me just show you
what vortices are

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.340
and how they are formed.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:42.710
Vortices come-- if you solve
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation--

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.090
if you ever any quantum
fluid or quantum gas,

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.410
and you add angular momentum,
the angular momentum cannot

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.820
lead to rigid body rotation.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.500
This would violate the fact
that the velocity field has

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.640
to be irrotational to make
sure that the phase of the wave

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.320
function is well defined.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.620
So if you rotate the system,
it can absorb angular momentum

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.050
only by forming vortices.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:13.390
And vortices are singular points
of the wave function-- singular

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.770
points where the density is 0.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:21.100
In other words-- I don't have
time to be exhaustive here--

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.090
but when something
rotates, there

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.397
is a dynamic phase you
can say, because there

00:32:26.397 --> 00:32:28.230
are matter waves
going in circles.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.320
And the integral
of the phase has

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.525
to be an integer number
of 2 pi, otherwise

00:32:33.525 --> 00:32:35.650
you would not have a
well-defined phase of the wave

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.790
function.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.920
And if you now say you make
a circle, which is 2 pi.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.170
You make the circle
smaller, smaller, smaller.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.410
In the middle of the
circle, you go around.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.620
The wave function
changes by 2 pi,

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.200
but what should the wave
function do on one point?

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.990
Which number between 0 and 2 pi
should the wave function peak?

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.010
Well, the wave function
says I can't peak.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.500
I just go to 0.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.360
And a 0 value has no
phase and I'm fine.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.640
That's exactly what the
wave function tells you.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.290
So therefore if you want
to describe vortices,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.000
you want to now describe the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.140
but with the boundary condition
that the wave function

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.520
goes to 0.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.530
And if you want to
describe one vortex,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:20.130
you want the wave function to
go 0 in the center of the cloud.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.010
And so you make a
corresponding Ansatz.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.310
You allow the phase to
wrap around by 2 pi,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.530
when the angle phi is varied.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.210
And then when you solve
it, you have, of course,

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:37.280
put in that there should be a
0 of the density at the center.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.230
And it's now nice for me to--
there's an important review

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.120
paper which describes
all that and more--

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.610
but it's nice to
show you now the two

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.680
extreme cases of the ideal
condensate without interaction,

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.190
and the strong
interacting condensate.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:57.090
The ideal condensate-- well, we
are in the first excited state

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.480
of the harmonic
oscillator potential.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.580
And this is the dashed line.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.120
And of course, the size
of the whole, the 0,

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.090
is pretty much on the order
of the oscillator length,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.960
because there is no
other length scale

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.440
in the ideal
harmonic oscillator.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.949
But if you have the
interacting system,

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.360
remember what
interactions are doing.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.630
They want to keep the density
as constant as possible.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.300
Well, we are not
in a box potential.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.050
We're in an inverted
parabola potential.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.489
And remember, our
Thomas-Fermi solution,

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.650
which neglects kinetic energy,
is the inverted parabola

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.780
up to here.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.285
And then the tail is
when we can no longer

00:34:36.285 --> 00:34:38.429
neglect the kinetic energy.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.720
But if we now say, OK, fine,
but now in addition, we

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.679
want a vortex in
the center, the wave

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.650
function out there says no.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.040
We do what minimizes
kinetic energy,

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.850
and what minimizes
repulsive energy.

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.520
We follow the inverted
parabola, and only

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.970
at the very last moment-- on
the scale of the healing length,

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.700
the system meets the
required boundary condition

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.400
that the density goes to 0.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.510
Anyway, with this
qualitative understanding,

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.930
you can get a lot out of those.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.300
You can immediately
understand the salient feature

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.100
of the solution.

00:35:15.274 --> 00:35:16.242
Question?

00:35:16.242 --> 00:35:18.178
AUDIENCE: I know we're
not talking details,

00:35:18.178 --> 00:35:20.350
but is there a simple,
maybe clear reason why

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.802
when you spin a
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:35:22.802 --> 00:35:25.085
you get many vortices, but
when you spin your coffee

00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:28.285
in your cup, you
just get one big one?

00:35:28.285 --> 00:35:28.910
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:39.720
So the question is, if I have
a wrap-around of 4 pi in phase,

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:48.575
whether the system should have
a doubly charged vortex, or two

00:35:48.575 --> 00:35:50.740
singly charged vortices?

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.660
What is the
difference in energy?

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:58.760
Well, what happens is doubly
charged vortices are unstable.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.842
My group, at some point,
were the first to create

00:36:00.842 --> 00:36:02.300
doubly charged
vortices, but we saw

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.815
that they immediately decayed.

00:36:04.815 --> 00:36:05.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:06.370
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.060
PROFESSOR: Initially,
we couldn't observe.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.810
We just saw that
it was unstable.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.560
But it's a decay
into two vortices.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.220
But it's easy to understand.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.280
If you put two vortices
on top of each other,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.110
what is the energy of the
system compared to one vortex?

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:29.550
Well, the energy of a vortex is
the rotational field around it,

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.420
and if you superimpose
two vortices,

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.450
the velocity around the
doubly charged vortices

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.500
is twice the velocity
of one vortex.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.300
And therefore, the kinetic
energy is four times.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.210
If you have two
vortices which are

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.620
far separated that it has
its own velocity field.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.580
It has its own
velocity field here.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.970
And when the two velocity
fields come together,

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.150
the velocity is
already so low that you

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:58.400
don't have to consider that,
then those two vortices have

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.550
an energy which is two times
the energy of a single vortex.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.980
So therefore, when
the two vortices,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.260
they start out with four times
the energy of a single vortex,

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.170
and when they dissociate
and repel each other,

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.850
they have shed half
of their energy.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.230
So this argument
tells you immediately

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.850
that vortices are
in effect repulsive.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:23.530
And therefore, any
multiple-charged vortex

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.170
will spontaneously decay.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.110
It's also this net
repulsion between vortices

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.800
which makes the vortices
arrange in a regular lattice.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.090
The regular lattice
which you saw before

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.120
is Nature's answer to
how can we minimize

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.270
the energy of all
those vortices?

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.990
And the idea is let's keep the
average distance between them

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.230
as large as possible, and the
answer is a hexagonal lattice.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.870
Yeah.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.060
AUDIENCE: So a few
slides back, when

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:01.120
you write the G-P equation, when
you plotted sort of for the box

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.920
potential, the ground state
and the excited state comparing

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.510
the G-P equation to the typical
single-particle [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:11.472
And so I guess I'm a
little bit confused

00:38:11.472 --> 00:38:15.040
about how excitations manifest
themselves in the system.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.730
Because in some sense, if you
were to solve the G-P equation,

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:25.180
would you arrive at a
spectrum of solutions?

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.150
Then I guess I'd be confused
at whether excitations manifest

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.490
themselves into that
spectrum of solutions,

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:35.990
or rather than they become
excitations, sort of deviations

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.706
from the mean field as
including the [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:39.706 --> 00:38:41.580
PROFESSOR: You are now
asking about something

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.288
more complicated.

00:38:42.288 --> 00:38:43.740
You're asking what
are the excited

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.690
states of the many-body system?

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.900
And actually, we have
already found one answer.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:53.200
And this is if you want
these small excitations,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.020
it's one particle
becomes a phonon,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.990
or one particle becomes
a quasiparticle.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.300
What we are talking
about here is

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.840
what happens if the
whole macroscopic wave

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.020
function is in an excited state.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.600
So we are asking here in
the box potential what

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.030
happens if you force all N atoms
to have one node in the wave

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.620
function.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.590
And this is what I'm
talking about here.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.400
So the excitation
energy of this state

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.300
here is much, much higher
than of single quasiparticle

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.010
excitations.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:29.580
I'm not sure if I'm addressing
your question here, but--

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.585
AUDIENCE: So with
single quasiparticle

00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:34.209
excitations, are
those essentially sort

00:39:34.209 --> 00:39:35.682
of deviations from
the mean field?

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.280
PROFESSOR: No, they
are-- you really

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:52.390
look for many-body physics--
main field deviations--

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.550
probably.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:40:00.500
I mean, what you do
is in that sense, yes.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.070
You're allowing in this
Ansatz that psi operator

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:07.040
is psi average
plus fluctuations.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.710
You now look for
fluctuations, and you're

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.200
looking for the
energy eigenspectrum

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.090
of those fluctuations.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.840
And the answer are
quasiparticles.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.000
So it is, actually,
the Bogoliubov solution

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.090
for the spectrum of
the fluctuations.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:30.440
And the answer is the dispersion
relation I presented to you.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.740
Whereas here we
are asking what are

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.600
excited states of the
macroscopic wave function?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.330
It's a very, very
different question

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.660
which we've addressed here.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.510
Yes.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.259
AUDIENCE: So when you
stir the condensate,

00:40:43.259 --> 00:40:48.310
do you view it as-- do you
stir, sort of, at the trap

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.312
frequency, so I do sort
of N single excitations?

00:40:51.312 --> 00:40:55.866
Or do you stir at N
times the trap frequency,

00:40:55.866 --> 00:40:59.608
so you get one sort of
N particle excitation?

00:40:59.608 --> 00:41:01.590
PROFESSOR: Well, the
experimental answer

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.140
is you want to stir at the
quadrupole frequency, which

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.100
is square root 2 times
the trap frequency.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.080
Then you create
quadrupolar excitations.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:14.660
The quadrupolar excitation can
be regarded as a standing sound

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.990
wave, but you create
a macroscopic number

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:19.730
of those excitations.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.450
So you make, actually, the
whole condensate wave function

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:25.680
oscillate in a
quadrupolar pattern,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.390
but it's a rotating
quadrupole, and that

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.620
eventually then rearranges
itself and leads to vortices.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:40.070
So I think the correct answer
is the most efficient way

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:45.350
to create vortices would be to
excite quasiparticles, but then

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.150
create so many-- and this may
relate to Matt's question--

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.490
create so many quasiparticles
that you have really

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.570
a time-dependent and oscillating
macroscopic wave function.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.990
So eventually, you have
a coherent excitation

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.200
of quasiparticles.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.780
And that eventually means
the condensate moves

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.310
in a quadrupolar pattern, but
it's a quadrupolar pattern

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.290
with rotation, and
that eventually

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.940
turns into many vortices.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.500
But that's really a very rich
question which you're asking,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.210
which has been studied-- a lot
of different aspects of that

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:24.960
have been studied.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.760
OK, so we've talked about
Bose-Einstein condensates

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.350
in a homogeneous system, just
sort of to lay the groundwork.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.570
We've talked about
Bose-Einstein condensates

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.150
in traps in
inhomogeneous system.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.070
Now we want to talk about
Bose-Einstein condensates

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:48.850
in optical lattices.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.050
Well, there are two reasons
why we want to do that.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:56.390
One is we want to use the
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.490
to obtain deeper insight into
the properties of matter.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:05.640
And a lot of forms of matter
appear in periodic lattices.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.990
So if you put a
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.580
into a periodic
potential, we can at least

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.700
understand some
of the properties

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.870
of crystalline
matter, or electrons

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:22.200
which are block waves
in a periodic potential.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.470
So this is one reason why.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.630
The other reason why we want
to go to optical lattices

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:31.530
is the following-- ideal
Bose-Einstein condensates

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.580
are trivial.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:39.020
Weakly interacting Bose-Einstein
condensates are entertaining,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.570
and you can write a lot of
papers, have a lot of fun

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.800
with it, develop your methods--
also mildly intellectually

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.460
interesting because how those
weak interactions manifest

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.690
itself in vortices and all.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:53.580
It's really rich
and interesting.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.760
But the conceptional
problems appear

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.560
when you go to
strong interactions.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.420
Strongly correlated matter is
where mean field descriptions

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.430
no longer work.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.340
This is really the frontier
of our understanding

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.440
of many-body systems.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:13.917
And when you want
to be there, you

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.750
want to create a strongly
correlated system.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.020
And strongly correlated systems
means that the interaction

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.330
energy dominates
over kinetic energy.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.300
In Bose-Einstein
condensates you can only

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.360
go so far with
increasing interactions--

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.210
why are Feshbach resonances?

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.770
Because you get into some
inelastic collisions.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.080
So that's one knob to turn.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.490
You go to larger and larger
of scattering lengths,

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:38.530
and crank up the interactions.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:42.600
But if atoms strongly interact,
they start to do bad chemistry.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.790
They start to spin flip.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.020
They do other things.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.410
And in some cases you
keep it under control.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.310
In others, you just can't
keep it under control.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.270
But another way to get
to strong interactions

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.570
means you reduce
the kinetic energy.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:59.030
It's the ratio of the
two which matters.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:02.390
And when you put particles
in a lattice, well,

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:05.410
the lattice actually
reduces the kinetic energy.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.200
You may know from
condensed matter physics

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.500
that in a lattice there is
an effective mass, which

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.520
is higher than the
[INAUDIBLE] mass.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.220
Therefore you've reduced
the kinetic energy.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.020
Or if you want another
hand-waving approximation,

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.630
the kinetic energy is
given by the bandwidths.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.390
And if the tunneling
becomes slower and slower,

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.580
the width of your
band becomes narrower,

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.880
and your kinetic energy is less.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.800
So anyway, I can give you many
hand-waving approximations

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.810
why in a lattice,
kinetic energy is reduced

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.120
and repulsive energy
is probably enhanced,

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.100
because instead of having
your atoms spread out,

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:47.160
they're bunched up
at each lattice site

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.960
into a higher density cloud.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.190
So anyway, maybe you're
interested in parity

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.510
potentials, or you're
interested in quantum systems

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.070
with strong correlations.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.590
For whatever reasons, you
want optical lattices.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:05.270
Now I have here a
few slides which

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.280
introduce periodic
potentials, but it is really

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.010
just the single particle
physics in a periodic potential.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.030
It has nothing do
with quantum gases.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.780
This could be the
first lecture of how

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:20.230
to describe
electrons in a metal.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.330
So let me just quickly
go through assuming

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.350
that almost all of
you are familiar.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:29.480
But I use those slides also just
to give you a few definitions

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.850
and introduce a few symbols.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:36.050
So this is simple, boring,
exactly understood physics.

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:39.090
We have a Hamiltonian
which has kinetic energy,

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:43.170
and a periodic potential which
is our lattice potential.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:48.090
It's rather trivial to solve,
but exactly for your wave

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.690
function, you use
Bloch's theorem

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:54.260
and divide it by an exponential
factor with quasi momentum

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.870
times a periodic function.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:00.180
And if you now solve
Schrodinger's equation,

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.210
you want to use Fourier space.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.900
You Fourier analyze
the wave function.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.010
You Fourier analyze
the potential.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.730
And since the
potential is periodic,

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:16.550
sine square potential has
only three Fourier components

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:23.240
at 0 plus/minus 1 times the
periodicity of the lattice.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:28.800
You do a Fourier expansion for
your periodic wave function.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.480
And if you insert that into
Schrodinger's equation,

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.600
well, the Fourier transform
has turned the differential

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.120
equation into an
algebraic equation,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.380
because the second
derivative simply

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:46.970
becomes now k
squared or q squared.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.245
So in other words, you have
a set of linear equations.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.630
There is an index
which is the band

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.340
index-- how high
do you want to go?

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.170
And usually you truncate it.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:01.360
But it's the same.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.730
It is that same
trivial story which

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:07.620
is told in all textbooks of
condensed matter physics.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.810
If you have no band structure,
well, you have the parabola,

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.570
but to prepare for
band structure,

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.850
I've opened it down here in
the first Brillouin zone.

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.250
And if you now
introduce a lattice,

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:23.810
you introduce band gaps, and you
go from the left to the middle

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:28.190
to the right for stronger
and stronger lattices.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:30.500
So the case which
I will focus on,

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.610
because it is the most extreme
case away from free space,

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:41.580
is this case which is called
the tight binding limit, where

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.220
the potential energy of
the lattice is large.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:51.880
And large means compared
with the kinetic energy

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.980
at the Brillouin
Zone, which is k

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:57.170
squared-- k is the lattice
momentum-- k squared over 2 m.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.260
And that's the recoil energy.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.350
So that our dimensionless
parameter here

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.880
is the depth of the
lattice measured

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.000
in recoil energies
of the photon,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.650
because that is
the kinetic energy

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.290
of the free gas at
the Brillouin zone.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:19.190
OK there are few things which
immediately simplify that.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:20.910
Once we're in the
tight binding limit,

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:24.610
our lattice is really
deep, and each side

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.710
forms a harmonic oscillator.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.530
And the harmonic
oscillator frequency

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:32.650
is analytically given by
the depth of the lattice.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:37.150
And the solution here
for the lowest band

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.190
is that the lowest
band-- the energy

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:43.780
in the lowest band, the
dispersion relation is-- well,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.170
we have a harmonic oscillator
in each site at x y z.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:49.810
So the average energy
in the lowest band

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:54.940
is the 0 point energy in x, y,
and z-- three half h-bar omega

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.000
0.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.780
And then we have a
cosinusoidal band structure

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.570
where q is the quasimomentum.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.930
And what appears here as the
only interesting parameter

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:07.600
is j.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:15.990
And j is I think this 4
should be 4j is the bandwidth.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.310
So what appears here now
for the first time is j.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:26.030
It appears here
as the bandwidth.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:30.250
But let me immediately give
it another interpretation

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.940
as a tunneling matrix element in
the following way-- right now,

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:39.030
we have formulated the physics
in Bloch wave functions

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.150
which are infinitely extended.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.580
The Bloch wave functions
are for the lattice

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.770
what plain waves
are for free space.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:50.780
But if you have
tight binding limit,

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.860
there is another limit
which is important.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:58.340
Namely, a particle is localized
and hops around in the lattice.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.130
The localized particle, of
course, is in free space.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:06.540
It would be a wave packet-- a
superposition of plain waves.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.490
So let's do the
same in the lattice.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.060
Let's construct
superpositions of Bloch waves.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.910
And these are our wave packets.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.420
And the wave packet is now
called the Wannier function.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.510
And there is a
mathematical procedure

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.530
how you should pick
the phases here

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.710
to get the maximal
normalization.

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:28.210
But the simple picture is
those Wannier functions are

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:31.730
very, very close to the
Gaussian ground state

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:35.050
solution of the harmonic
oscillator on each side.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:39.080
The wings are different, but
I don't want to go into that.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:43.740
You transform from an
orthonormal basis of Bloch wave

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:48.630
function to another orthonormal
basis Wannier function.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.760
And the Wannier functions are
as well localized as possible.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.800
That's the procedure.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.970
And now we can simply
rewrite our total Hamiltonian

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:03.385
or everything we're interested
in, not in Bloch wave functions

00:52:03.385 --> 00:52:06.960
but in Wannier wave functions.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:12.250
And what comes out now is,
is that the bandwidth j

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:17.860
is nothing else than our
Hamiltonian with kinetic energy

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.540
in the periodic potential.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.600
But j becomes now
a matrix element

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.040
between two Wannier functions.

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:31.990
But the Wannier
functions have now-- I'll

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.010
put in some indices
in a moment--

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.890
connect now two different sides.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.540
So it is-- you have
Wannier function.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.760
You have the Hamiltonian
and connect it

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.690
to another Wannier function.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:49.050
So it is the amplitude
that, with the Hamiltonian,

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.890
the particle can hop from
one side to another side.

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:56.390
So therefore j, which
was the bandwidth,

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.890
is now the tunneling
energy divided

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:03.020
by h bar-- the tunneling
rate from on one side

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.910
to the other side.

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.100
For very deep lattice,
everything is analytic

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.460
and it can easily be solved.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.210
And I mentioned already in the
tight binding approximation,

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:16.060
you should think about
your Wannier function

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.310
as just localized
Gaussian eigensolutions

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:22.070
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.190
Yes?

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:28.660
AUDIENCE: So qualitatively, this
question sounds sort of silly,

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:32.140
but normally when we write
down the solution for j,

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.810
we're only considering
nearest neighbor.

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:39.275
But from the math,
I don't immediately

00:53:39.275 --> 00:53:44.230
see why we wouldn't
include i equal to j.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:46.790
PROFESSOR: Give
me one more slide.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:53.870
So I should've
actually-- what I should

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:57.920
have done is that--
j has an index here.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.580
I just didn't want to
overload you with indices.

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.330
I mean, this is sort
of just telling you

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.010
what j is in its simplest form.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.610
It is loaded with indices and
I well show you in a moment

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.780
where those indices come in.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.920
So I just wanted to
give you the idea

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.750
if we want to have
Wannier function.

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:20.850
We hop from one Wannier
function to the other one,

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:23.060
and the operator
is the Hamiltonian.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:28.840
And therefore, there
should be an index j and l.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:34.280
And maybe-- let me just do the
next step first and then come

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.030
back to it, but I
wanted to tell you here

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:39.040
what I'm aiming at--
namely interpretation of j,

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.460
of tunneling from
one side to the next.

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:47.400
But right now I haven't really
told you which j I really mean.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.930
There should be-- based
on the right-hand side,

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:53.040
there is a j which
has two indices.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.480
And I will make the indices
disappear in a moment.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.730
But before I make those
indices disappear,

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.350
let me introduce the other
relevant parameter, which

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.850
will also have
indices, and that is we

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.540
have to bring in
the interactions.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.150
We want to describe
an interacting system.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.680
We describe an
interacting system

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.490
using the short-range
approximation

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:20.690
by assuming that two particles
interact with a delta function.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:26.360
And if you have two particles
on site, each of them

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.370
has a density which is the
Wannier function squared.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:33.950
And the product of the
two densities integrated

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:38.910
gives us the expectation value
for the repulsive energy.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.440
And this is given here.

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.000
So the moment we
introduce interactions,

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.820
we are now interested in
the interaction energy

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:57.150
between two particles which in
this case occupy the same side.

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:01.010
OK so I've tried to introduce
was what sort of j is.

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.730
j is a matrix element
between two Wannier functions

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:05.750
with a Hamiltonian in between.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:10.430
And u is the matrix element
of two Wannier functions

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:13.730
with the interaction
operator in between.

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:15.860
And now I want to
use that concept

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:21.200
to take my full
Hamiltonian and transform

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.570
from field operators localized
at x to Wannier functions.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.650
So they B operators are
now creation operators.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:31.820
They create an atom
in a Wannier function.

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.920
In other words, B
dagger means you

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.370
have a particle in a
Wannier function at site i.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:40.380
And I just use that as
a basis transformation

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.380
and the exact transformation
of this Hamiltonian

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:47.250
is now into this form.

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:47.750
So

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:52.850
What I have right now is, I have
the tunneling matrix element

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:54.570
between particles
at site i and j,

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.140
and I have to sum
over all of them.

00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:15.060
And in terms of interaction,
I can calculate this matrix

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.620
element by using Wannier
function with four

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.540
different indices
and ask what happens.

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.880
And this is simply an
exact way of rewriting it.

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.190
And here I've given
you the definition.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.720
So if you want to
forget everything

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:34.800
I told you about j and u, I've
done an exact transformation

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:38.490
from field operators to Wannier
function creation operators.

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:45.050
And this introduces tunneling
terms like this from site i

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:47.070
to site j.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:51.940
And these here includes products
of four Wannier functions

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.370
which are responsible
for the interaction term.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:57.960
Actually, if this is
not complicated enough,

00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.670
I've suppressed
band indices here.

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:03.050
I should also now sum
over all possible bands.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:07.540
But OK, I want to come now
to the leading approximation

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.020
in a tight binding model.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.210
And that is where--
I mean those Wannier

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:12.910
functions are overlapped.

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.770
Two neighboring Wannier
functions barely overlap.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:19.050
If I go further away, the
overlap becomes even smaller.

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:22.950
So the most dominant terms are
nearest neighbor interactions.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.450
And the nearest
neighbor interaction

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.230
is where i and j differ by 1.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:30.440
And this is what I
call j without indices.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:35.970
And similarly, when it comes
to the interaction term

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:40.620
where we have products
of four Wannier functions

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.020
and we want to get the
overlap of all four,

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.650
and then multiply it with g,
the prefactor of our delta

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.260
function to get an
interaction term,

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.530
well the best overlap is if
all indices are the same.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.780
And this is what I call U.

00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:00.750
So in that limit, in
that tight binding limit,

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.300
my Hamiltonian is
now very simple.

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:08.530
It consists of a tunneling
term parametrized with j,

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:16.470
and an on site interaction
term parametrized with U. Yes.

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.830
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
i, j and k are all the same,

00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:22.710
so the interaction
is with itself?

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:29.790
PROFESSOR: No, two
particles per site.

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:32.460
When the four
particles are the same,

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:40.590
it turns into-- this
Hamiltonian here has

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:42.510
all indices are the same.

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:49.680
And if you calculate that, it
turns into the product of 2 b.

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.520
b dagger is the occupation
number at each site.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.690
But if you're careful
with commutators,

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:58.980
it becomes occupation number
times occupation number

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.140
minus 1.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.700
If you have only one particle
per site, this term is 0.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:09.930
So technically U is, if
you put in 2 times 1,

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:11.980
if you have two
particles per site,

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.460
U is the interaction energy
between two particles.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.240
Just use this
expression to figure out

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.740
what it is for three or four.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.280
But for one particle, you get 0.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.230
The self interaction of a
particle is absolutely 0.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.235
One particle does not
interact with itself.

01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:33.570
AUDIENCE: That gets back to my
question with the [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:40.120
So when you have i equals j, the
[INAUDIBLE] term, do you just--

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.670
PROFESSOR: No, I assume,
i j is nearest neighbor.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.966
I assume that the index
i and j differ by 1.

01:00:46.966 --> 01:00:49.215
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean your
argument was that the best

01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:50.915
overlap is between
nearest neighbors.

01:00:50.915 --> 01:00:51.540
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.390
AUDIENCE: So an overlap
with the Wannier functions

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.145
at the same site is sort
of the kinetic energy term.

01:01:01.145 --> 01:01:04.070
Is it approximately 0,
or you just absorb that

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.310
into the chemical potential?

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:07.430
PROFESSOR: This is a 0.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:14.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So we're only

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:18.635
looking at nearest neighbor,
so are we essentially saying

01:01:18.635 --> 01:01:23.254
the case where i equals j is
approximately 0 [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:23.254 --> 01:01:25.045
AUDIENCE 2: Because
it's the matrix element

01:01:25.045 --> 01:01:25.870
of a Hamiltonian.

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:29.830
So p, the candidate, plus
the lattice operator.

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:32.800
So if I take my
Wannier function,

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.770
which is built out of
eigenvalues for that equation,

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.245
[INAUDIBLE] bunch
of energy terms.

01:01:38.245 --> 01:01:40.720
On every site [INAUDIBLE]
they're the same.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.690
Because you have a common
[INAUDIBLE] energy that you can

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:44.720
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.886
AUDIENCE: Well then just
multiple it by [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.340
PROFESSOR: My gut
feeling is-- and this

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.580
is why nobody considers
it-- it's just

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:59.660
a constant energy, which is
probably something like the 0

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.150
point energy times the number
of particles, which is not

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.600
affecting any dynamics.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.510
It's pretty much a constant
which can be simply dropped.

01:02:11.814 --> 01:02:13.230
Let me just go
back to that slide.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:19.570
I hope-- let me just
look up the reference.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.820
I haven't looked at it recently.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.930
When we do this
exact transformation,

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:26.760
there should be a
reference whether i

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.010
and j, what happens
when i equals j.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.869
I think it's just
a constant term.

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:34.327
AUDIENCE: Because
if you're summing

01:02:34.327 --> 01:02:35.857
over every single
lattice site, so

01:02:35.857 --> 01:02:38.100
you get the number of
particles times 0 [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.766
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
even mathematically

01:02:39.766 --> 01:02:43.160
it gives just a constant term,
here, which is [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:43.660
Thanks.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.530
It was good to clarify it.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:50.680
OK, I think within
the next 20 minutes,

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.986
I can step you through
the superfluid to Mott

01:02:53.986 --> 01:02:54.860
insulator transition.

01:02:57.490 --> 01:03:03.100
First, references for what
I've just said are given here.

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:11.940
But let me now come take
this Bose-Hubbard model

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.930
and discuss its
two limiting cases.

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:19.560
One case is where U
is much larger than j.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.500
The other case is where
j is much larger than U.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.740
These are the two
limiting cases,

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.820
and it will turn out
that one is an insulator

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.980
and one is a superfluid.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.150
And that makes perfect
sense, of course.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:37.040
If U is much larger than
j, I can set j equals to 0

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.410
if I can neglect it.

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:42.330
No tunneling means no transport,
and that means an insulator.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:47.250
It's also clear that when
there is no tunneling,

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.720
that the system is
really described

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.690
by a product of so and so
many particles per site.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.260
So it could be one
particle per site.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.020
And I have a product
over all sites,

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.270
or two particles per site.

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.010
So this will be
the ground state.

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:08.610
And it's called the ground
state of the Mott insulator.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:10.610
It's also trivial
to discuss what

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:13.050
happens if j is much,
much larger than U,

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:17.620
because then I simply neglect
U, and I have a free gas.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.300
Well, a free gas of
Bloch wave function,

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:26.910
but that's the same as a free
gas of planar wave function.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:30.600
It's just that quasimomentum
replaces momentum.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.950
And if you have just
an ideal Bose gas

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:36.490
in a periodic lattice instead
of Bose-Einstein condensation

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:38.520
in the lowest
momentum state, you

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.490
have Bose-Einstein condensation
in the lowest quasimomentum

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:43.480
state.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.400
The lowest quasimomentum
state is a superposition

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.170
of all Wannier
function-- I mean,

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:51.580
the 0 momentum
state in free space

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:57.830
is a superposition of all
position delta functions.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:59.870
The plane wave is delocalized.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.740
And the lowest
quasimomentum state

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.290
is just completely delocalized
over all Wannier functions.

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:07.910
But this is nothing
else than the q

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:11.660
equals 0 quasimomentum
Bloch wave.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.410
The interesting
question is-- and this

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:17.270
has led to hundreds if not
more papers in the literature--

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:21.230
how do we go from one
limit to the other limit?

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.690
And now you would
say, well, maybe we

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.850
should use what
has worked so well.

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:28.490
We should use the
Bogoliubov approximation.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.330
Just assume we
have a condensate,

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:36.580
replace all those kind of a 0
operators for the lowest Bloch

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.610
waves.

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:41.390
However, this doesn't work,
because the interesting thing

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:44.750
here is to find the
transition from the superfluid

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.125
from the Bose-Einstein
condensate

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:48.710
to an insulating state.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.800
The nature of this
approximation is

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.960
that you need N 0 to be large.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.200
But we're interested when the
condensate wave function turns

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.670
to 0, and in the
insulator it becomes 0.

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.970
So we are actually interested
in the opposite limit.

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:06.950
And indeed, if you
would ignore everything

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.590
I've just said that
doesn't make sense

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.260
to make this approximation
and make it nevertheless,

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.500
you will find that you never
get the insulating state

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.200
because you've pretty much
eliminated the possibility

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.316
to describe an insulating state
by doing this approximation.

01:06:21.316 --> 01:06:22.690
So I want to show
you now that we

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.680
have to do another mean
field approximation, which

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.800
is actually nice.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.890
It's very different from this
Bogoliubov approximation,

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:34.850
but it's also a mean
field approximation

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.830
which will describe our system.

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:43.010
So the goal is now
that I want to find

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:47.540
an effective Hamiltonian
which describes

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.090
the transition
from here to there.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:53.190
And the important
approximation I will use

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:58.300
was is the following-- again,
I have to get rid of operators.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.500
Products of two many
operators cannot be solved.

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.290
And so what I will do is I
will use products of operators,

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:08.960
write them as average
value plus fluctuations.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.730
And then when I
multiply that out,

01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:15.240
I take the product of
the average values,

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.050
and I include the
fluctuations in leading order.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:23.370
So I take delta A times B
and delta B times A average,

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:27.360
but I neglect the product
of those fluctuations.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.070
You can say I neglect the
correlation of fluctuations

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.480
here.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.240
So this is spelled out here.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.870
But the sign is important.

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:45.390
Just look at this equation--
A delta B plus delta B with B

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:48.440
plus A average times B average.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:55.920
If I absorb A times B by
upgrading delta B to B,

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.170
but I do the same here,
I have to subtract

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:01.780
1 product of the
two average values.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.510
It's actually this minus sign
which will play a role later,

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:09.110
but here you see already that
I will make this decoupling

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:11.600
approximation-- that I
decouple the fluctuations

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.160
from each other and I
write it in this way,

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.240
there is an
important minus sign.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:24.000
OK, so we want to start
in the insulating state.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.620
And we're going to figure out
how does the system develop

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.569
superfluidity out of
the insulation state?

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:33.110
And the perturbation
operator which takes me out

01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:37.290
of the insulating
state is tunneling.

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:41.470
So therefore, the operator which
is responsible for breaking out

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:44.890
of the insulating
state is the operator

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:49.060
which induces tunneling
between neighboring sites.

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.890
And the tunneling operator
in this Hamiltonian--

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:56.580
remember, the Bose-Hubbard
model had j times B dagger B--

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.550
this was our tunneling
term-- this involves now

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:02.240
products of operators.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.330
And I told you we want to get
rid of products of operators

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:07.470
to get something we
can easily solve.

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:10.370
So we use now this
product of operators

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:14.310
on two neighboring sites.

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:20.660
And we use exactly this
decoupling approximation.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:26.210
So therefore, we replace each
operator by an average value,

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:28.880
and we neglect the product
of the fluctuations.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.899
And then we obtain this.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:34.750
And I explained to you where
the minus sign came from.

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:45.659
So now I call this average
value of the operator B l,

01:09:45.659 --> 01:09:48.529
I call the superfluid
order parameter psi.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.820
I think I could have
chosen psi to be complex,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:01.410
and then B l dagger B l
would have complex conjugate.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:05.450
But it's sufficient here
to restrict the discussion

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:08.690
on real numbers, and it
makes the notation simpler.

01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:12.040
So anyway, I introduce that.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.650
And what happens now
is the following--

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:19.770
that I have my Hamiltonian.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:23.510
The Hamiltonian had
the interaction energy.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:33.110
But the tunneling term
is now very simplified,

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:35.520
because instead of
tunneling from one site

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.660
to a neighboring
site, the other side

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.640
is sort of absorbed
by the mean field,

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.730
by the superfluid
order parameter psi.

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:51.470
And therefore, and this
here gives me a psi

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:55.270
squared term which appears here.

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:58.720
Trust me, this is just
an identical rewrite

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.850
of the previous Hamiltonian
by using this decoupling

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:05.160
approximation.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.860
So what we have gained now
is something really dramatic.

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:13.540
We had many sites and
tunneling from site to site.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:20.020
But if you look at
it now, we simply sum

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.850
the effective Hamiltonian
over site index l.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.460
So our effective
Hamiltonian is now

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.950
the sum of an identical
Hamiltonian per site.

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.760
The sites no longer
interact with each other.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.930
Each site interacts with all
the other sites described

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.530
by the mean field by the
superfluid order parameter psi.

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.800
So therefore, our
many-body problem,

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.380
which is still a
many-body problem,

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.720
but has turned into an effective
Hamiltonian for each site,

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.910
because each side has
the same Hamiltonian.

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:53.410
Colin.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:57.730
AUDIENCE: What happened
to the j psi squared term?

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.132
PROFESSOR: This here?

01:12:00.132 --> 01:12:00.840
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.740
PROFESSOR: OK so I can say
instead of solving for the sum,

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.850
I can just solve for
each site individually.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:17.780
And this is now my effective
Hamiltonian for each site.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:23.510
Now I want to catch the
onset of superfluidity.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:27.240
So I want to get the
system when psi is small.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.690
And therefore, I can just
ask-- I don't know what psi is.

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.060
It's part of my solution.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.290
But I'm interested
in the moment when

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:39.720
psi begins to take off from
0, when superfluidity emerges.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:45.280
So what I can therefore do is,
I can regard psi as an epsilon

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.930
parameter, as a small parameter.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:52.310
And the psi parameter
comes with an operator V.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:57.700
And this operator V is nothing
else than B l dagger plus B l.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.030
So in other words,
what I'm doing is,

01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:04.370
I'm separating my Hamiltonian
into a Hamiltonian which

01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:06.960
is diagonal in the
quantum numbers

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.680
of the isolating state--
just one, two, three

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.600
particles per site.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.340
And psi squared is the Z number.

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:17.170
Psi squared is also
diagonal in that.

01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:19.560
And now the possibility
of tunneling,

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.720
the possibility of
superfluidity is now

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:29.610
perturbative in this
term psi times V.

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:33.460
OK, I don't want to explain,
actually, this expression.

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.020
It just formalizes
[INAUDIBLE] intermediate step.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.970
When we have the
chemical potential,

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.380
and we raise the
chemical potential--

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.330
we go from zero to
one particle per site

01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:45.950
to two particles per site.

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:48.180
And whatever the
chemical potential is

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.410
determines whether we have
one or two particles per site.

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:56.350
This is just telling me as a
function of chemical potential,

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.550
what is the ground
state of the insulator?

01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.960
So now we take this ground
state-- it's actually

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.240
much easier described
in words then

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.210
by this formula-- we
take this ground state

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:14.900
and do perturbation theory in
our term psi times V. Remember,

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:20.620
the operator is B dagger
B. And the epsilon is psi.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:26.220
So in second-order perturbation
theory, we get psi squared.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.480
And then V, because B B
dagger, is very simple.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:37.490
It only couples one occupation
number N to N plus 1

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:40.440
and N minus 1,
because B and B dagger

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.120
destroy or create a
particle per site.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.520
So therefore, I can
immediately write down

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.830
what this matrix element is
in second-order perturbation

01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:52.570
theory.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.930
I mean, these are all--
sorry, it's all defined here.

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:57.020
I know I'm losing you now.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.970
Nobody will tell me what is the
difference between U bar and U,

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.950
but it's trivially defined.

01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:07.330
So the idea is we have
the isolating system.

01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.020
We do perturbation
theory in tunneling.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:17.180
And the perturbative operator
is psi times B plus B dagger.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.160
The B plus B dagger
matrix elements

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.555
are trivial, because
they admix to N particles

01:15:22.555 --> 01:15:25.450
per site-- N plus
1 and N minus 1.

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.794
And this is what
we've done here.

01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:29.710
AUDIENCE: And the j is
just occupation number?

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:34.259
PROFESSOR: The j is the
occupation number of our site.

01:15:34.259 --> 01:15:35.550
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:41.044
So in the bottom equation, what
happened to the psi squared?

01:15:41.044 --> 01:15:42.460
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
this is the sum.

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.394
The psi square is missing.

01:15:44.394 --> 01:15:46.804
AUDIENCE: I guess I
had the same question

01:15:46.804 --> 01:15:50.184
for the equation next
to the green thing.

01:15:50.184 --> 01:15:52.860
Is there supposed to be
a psi squared in there?

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:56.360
Because originally, there's
a psi squared and an h0.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.090
PROFESSOR: No, this is the
ground state where psi is 0.

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:00.600
And now we do
perturbation theory

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.500
in psi V. These are the
unperturbed energies which

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.640
appear in the
energy denominator.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.530
The wave functions
we are using are

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:12.280
Fock states-- number
states-- per site.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:17.070
And here we couple occupation
number j to all possible N's.

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:21.050
But because of B and B dagger,
N has only two values--

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:22.741
j plus 1 and j minus 1.

01:16:22.741 --> 01:16:23.990
And this is what's given here.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.270
It's mathematically trivial.

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:31.820
The notation is more complicated
than the physics behind it.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:36.110
But now comes again-- I think I
need five minutes and I'm done.

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:37.920
But now comes the
interesting physics.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.080
We have to ask what
are we doing here?

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.720
It's all the mathematical, and
the math is really simple here.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.860
What we have done is we have
looked at the isolating state,

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:53.700
and we have done perturbation
theory in psi times B plus B

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.770
dagger.

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.710
And now we get an
energy correction

01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:59.760
which is psi squared.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.300
And what are we
really doing here?

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.440
Well, you can say
the following--

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.330
we started with a
hypothesis that we

01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:11.720
have a superfluid state
characterized by psi and psi,

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.300
at the onset of
superfluidity-- is small.

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.210
But now we have
done the calculation

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.590
assuming that there is a psi.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:21.370
But now we are turning around
and said have we really

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:24.450
done the system a favor by
introducing superfluidity?

01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:27.810
In other words, has our
perturbation theory in psi

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.250
lowered the energy of
the state or raised

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.000
the energy of the state.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.920
So in other words, we've done
a hypothetical calculation.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.920
Hey, what would the
system feel like if there

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.630
were a little bit
of superfluidity?

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:43.730
If the system says great,
I've lowered my energy,

01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.970
then we know we are in
the superfluid state.

01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:48.830
When the system says no,
I raised my energy because

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:52.090
of the psi, then the system
has rejected our idea

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:54.120
to introduce superfluidity.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.520
So therefore, the question
we are raising now

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.830
is after we have done the
calculation, for what values

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:07.100
of U and j is it favorable
to introduce a psi or not?

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.390
Now I was expecting the
question of some of you

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:12.030
that in second-order
perturbation theory,

01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:15.690
second-order perturbation
theory always lowers the energy.

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:18.850
But remember, this is why I
emphasized the minus sign--

01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:24.910
we had a psi squared term
which came from that, which

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:28.450
came from the last term of the
decoupling approximation, which

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.090
had a minus sign.

01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:34.120
And therefore, we
have in psi squared

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.755
one term which came
from this special psi--

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.530
and I emphasized in the
decoupling approximation.

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:42.500
And we have a contribution
of psi squared

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.480
which comes from
perturbation theory.

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.030
And the two together can
actually change their sign.

01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:51.695
So what we have right now is
if you describe the ground

01:18:51.695 --> 01:18:55.910
state as a function of psi,
we have our unperturbed energy

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:58.500
of the Mott insulating
states, and then we

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.390
have a term in psi squared.

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:06.620
And we should-- and we could,
but we don't-- calculate

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:09.740
the next order in
psi to the four.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.290
And it turns out in fourth-order
perturbation theory,

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:14.490
this term is always positive.

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:17.300
So what happens now
to the total energy

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:22.120
when this term A2, which we
have exactly analytically

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.610
calculated-- if this term A2
is larger or smaller than 0.

01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:33.090
Well, if you have a parabolic
term and a quartic term,

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:38.390
in this case, both the
quadratic and the quartic term

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:40.850
are opening up
like in a U shape,

01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:44.510
but here the total energy
turns into W shape.

01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:47.240
And the interpretation
is fairly simple.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.390
Under those
conditions, the system

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:54.010
prefers to have psi equal
0, whereas here, it's

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:58.120
like the system wants to
have a psi parameter which

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.960
is finite, either
positive or negative.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.110
And whether it's
positive or negative

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:05.520
is sometimes called
spontaneous symmetry breaking

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.190
between two
degenerate solutions.

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.160
What I'm showing
here is, of course,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.680
very similar to the
Ginzburg-Landau theory

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.980
of phase transitions, where
you have an effective potential

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:19.370
and the phase transition
takes place when

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:21.980
the second-order
coefficient changes sign,

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.890
and the effective potential
turns from U-shaped

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:27.020
into W-shaped.

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.260
So that's what we have done.

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:34.240
So anyway, I think this
is a nice problem where

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.980
the interpretation
is, I think, much more

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.120
subtle than the
calculation itself.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.410
But we've calculated
the phase transition.

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:44.200
Everything is analytic.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.090
Here is the analytic
result, which

01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:48.515
I know with very
indigestible notation.

01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:56.070
I followed exactly the paper
by Vanderstraeten, [? Stouff ?]

01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:58.860
and collaborators, which
is posted on the website.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.060
You can plot this phase
diagram in this way.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.200
But if you use what
is more common,

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:09.260
normalize the chemical potential
by U and normalize j by U,

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:13.470
you get these wonderful
lobes of the Mott insulator

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.940
where you see that,
if you increase

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.790
the chemical potential, you
have N equals 1, N equals 2,

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:23.192
N equals 3, Mott insulator,
and in between you

01:21:23.192 --> 01:21:25.530
go through superfluid regions.

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:29.290
However if your
tunneling is larger,

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:32.920
if your tunneling is too
large, you're only superfluid.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.330
So this is sort
of the way how you

01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:39.890
derive this rather
rich phase diagram

01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:43.190
of bosonic atoms in
an optical lattice.

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.260
Green is an insulating state.

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.990
And white is the
superfluid state.

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:52.350
Let me just conclude by
showing a few slides how

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:54.090
this can be observed.

01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:57.410
So in one case, we have
an insulating state

01:21:57.410 --> 01:22:00.410
with a definite number
of particles per site.

01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:02.680
And here we have
superfluid state,

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.790
which has the normal
fluctuations in number.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.830
Here's another cartoon picture
of an condensate in the lowest

01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:15.130
Bloch wave function.

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:19.430
And here you have
localized number states.

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:22.810
Often, you observe the
transition by taking the system

01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:25.430
and releasing it
in time of flight

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:27.470
into ballistic expansion.

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.850
If the superfluidity
is coherent,

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:33.760
the wave function on the
different sites is coherent.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.310
And what you get is a
multi-slit interference pattern,

01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:40.320
which is a diffraction pattern.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.830
And you see these characteristic
diffraction patterns.

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:46.320
It's an in-slit
diffraction pattern

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.360
which characterizes the
coherence in the initial state.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.870
However if you have a
completely isolating state,

01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:56.950
you have a Gaussian wave
packet on each side, which

01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:59.900
has nothing to do with
the next neighbor.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.420
And then the Gaussian
wave function simply

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.550
expands in a structureless way.

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:07.600
And so the transition
from here to there

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.670
happens exactly when
the ratio of U over j

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.900
crosses the value
we have derived.

01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:19.140
There's another
technique of observing

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.240
that which is more recent.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.800
This is a quantum
gas microscopes

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.240
where you do the same
physics in two dimensions,

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:31.210
so you have only one plane
where this physics takes place.

01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:34.860
And you can observe atoms
now with a microscope.

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.710
So each green dot
here is an atom.

01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:41.720
If you sort of zoom in.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.780
And if you now study
the region where

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:49.050
you go through the superfluid
to the Mott insulator,

01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:56.030
you see that you have
exactly one atom per site.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:24:00.530
If you increase the atom
number, you have an insulator

01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:02.800
with one atom per site.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.450
And in the middle,
you have state

01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:08.530
with two atoms per site,
which-- for reasons

01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:11.800
I don't want to discuss-- are
color-coded here in black.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.070
And that sort of
goes on and goes on.

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:18.430
So you can really
resolve site per site

01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:21.430
the occupation of the
number of atoms per site.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.580
So I think I'll stop
here with the Bose gases.

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.440
When you think the
Mott insulator is

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.410
the end of the story, all
motion has been frozen out

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:34.920
and you have one
particle per site, well,

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.170
it could be the

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.640
spin up and spin down, we
can talk about spin ordering.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.410
But this would be a
whole different lecture.

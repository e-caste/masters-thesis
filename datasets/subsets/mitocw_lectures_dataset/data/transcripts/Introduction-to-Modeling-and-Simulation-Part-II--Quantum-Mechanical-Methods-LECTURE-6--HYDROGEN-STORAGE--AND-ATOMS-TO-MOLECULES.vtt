00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.450
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
What we're going

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.060
to do today is now, as I
mentioned, shift gears.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.540
And we're going to go from
atoms and molecules to solids.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.150
So the outline for today is,
well, OK, so here we are.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.190
But remember, last
time we didn't really

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.380
talk about hydrogen storage.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.020
And some people--
well, like two people--

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.450
wanted to hear about
hydrogen storage.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.350
So I thought what I'll do is
I will just briefly discuss

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.130
this problem--

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.040
this energy problem, which
is a very interesting problem

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.130
and really, as I'll
show at the very end,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.070
is another one of
these huge phase space

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.350
problems where quantum
mechanical modeling is

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.440
going to be important.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.090
OK.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.270
And then we'll move on to
understanding what happens

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.560
when you have a crystal.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.790
When you go from these atoms and
molecules to an ordered array

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.970
of atoms and molecules,
which is a periodic crystal,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.517
what changes?

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:19.100
And there's something
really important

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.190
that changes in this
wave function that we've

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.403
been caring so much about.

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:25.820
And that's due to something
called Bloch's function, which

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.660
we'll talk about.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.400
And it results in the
orbitals becoming curvy.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.900
OK.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390
So that's kind of
the punch line.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.015
That's what we're
going to build up to.

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:39.440
And then next week
we'll pick up from that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.220
and talk about what that means.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.840
OK.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.860
Any questions at all?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.180
Thoughts?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.170
Hopes?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.900
Fears?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.040
Aspirations?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.470
OK.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.130
Right.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.930
That's my hydrogen storage
introduction slide.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.360
And what are the two problems
for hydrogen storage?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.350
Two challenges?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.510
Who can tell me?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.777
Yeah?

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:04.860
AUDIENCE: Making hydrogen.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.270
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Right.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.350
AUDIENCE: And then storing it.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.174
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Why do
we need to make hydrogen?

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:09.882
AUDIENCE: The Earth's
gravitational field

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:12.082
is [INAUDIBLE] so
it all evaporates.

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:13.040
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.880
Well, not all of it.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.480
There's still some of it.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.170
There's some of it with
which we make from.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.880
But where is it?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.320
It's tied up.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.920
It's busy.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.490
You know?

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.340
And you got to say,
hey, I need you.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.410
Get off of that methane
molecule or get off

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.830
of this other molecule
and come over here and be

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.510
an energy carrier for me.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.360
That takes energy to make the
hydrogen be available to use

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.300
as an energy carrier.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.854
And then the other
problem is what?

00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:46.730
AUDIENCE: Storing it.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.938
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Storing it.

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:48.582
Right.

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:49.540
Because it's very hard.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.970
So I'm going to talk
about the second problem

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.920
because, again, there's sort
of a molecular solution that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.080
really exciting where
computation can play a role.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.580
OK.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.662
So I'm just going to
spend the first 15,

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:04.120
20 minutes here
talking about this.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.505
I think this is--

00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:11.070
there are high opinions
about hydrogen-- gesundheit--

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.150
storage.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.280
And the hydrogen economy--

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.650
the hydrogen economy
is this sort of vision

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.100
that President Bush put forth.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.310
And he really kickstarted
a large research program

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.810
in this vision where
you would be able to--

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.510
a simple chemical reaction
between hydrogen and oxygen

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.800
generates energy.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.850
What's that called?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.510
There's a device that does that.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.603
That's a fuel cell.

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:41.270
We're not going to
talk about that part.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.485
We're not talking about what
you do with the hydrogen

00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:45.110
because there's all
kinds of challenges

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.650
there too, by the way.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.570
OK.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.340
So there's really
great research going

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.820
on in fuel cells, which are
what you put the hydrogen into

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.255
to make electricity.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.660
There is a new
national commitment.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.310
And there's going to be--

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.170
first car driven by
a child born today

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.110
could be powered by
hydrogen and pollution free.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.950
Yes.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.730
For $10 million per car.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.590
OK.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.320
I mean, I think a lot of
people were excited about this.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.100
But this is a very
large investment

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.420
for government research,
which is very little money.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.480
And in a technology
that clearly has

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.330
at least 50 years
of research that's

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.840
needed before you're
going to see a trial.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.520
So maybe this should have said
a child's future grandchild

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.720
born today.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.140
And that would be cool.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.390
OK.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.930
And yet, there are some
really great programs going on

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.445
to test the hydrogen economy.

00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:48.820
And those are the
kinds of things

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.113
we need to do now to lay
the groundwork for all

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:53.780
the challenges that
have to be overcome.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.287
Again, I'm just going
to talk about one

00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:57.370
of them, which is storage.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.100
But so I don't--

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.190
now, then Obama came in
and he slashed the budget.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.980
Actually, he tried to kill it--

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.460
the hydrogen research in this
country to 0, which I thought

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.720
was interesting because
in that administration

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.492
the sense was well,
it's a great technology.

00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:18.700
But it's a very long way off.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.290
Let's try to work on--

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.770
reshuffle our investment a
little into other things.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.940
Things that might
give a shorter return

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.570
in terms of technologies that
are needed in clean energy

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.240
more rapidly.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.660
OK.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.680
I've already shown this.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.610
I love this history of hydrogen.
When you have a moment, just

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.710
read some Jules
Verne where he said--

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.450
I think I already
read this quote.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.390
But he said, "I believe that one
day hydrogen and oxygen, which

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.060
together form water will
be used either alone

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.300
or together as an inexhaustible
source of heat and light."

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.840
I think that's really cool
that was in the 1800s.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.420
And then there are
some things that

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.560
happened along the way like that
blimp thing that I showed you.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.310
But see, now that has caused
a lot of misunderstanding

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.680
about hydrogen in that
it's, yes, it can combust.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.730
But how dangerous is it?

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.470
So I'll show you
a slide on that.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.970
Right.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.920
So the problem in the storage is
that the low volumetric density

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.110
of anything that's
a gas requires

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.610
something that can densify it.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.130
So you got to
compress it basically.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.770
Here's your metric gasoline.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.240
Remember, gasoline is this
beautiful high energy density

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.460
way of storing energy.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.510
32 megajoules per liter
compared with liquid hydrogen--

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.250
if you can liquefy it, it's 8.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.350
And gas under very
high pressure--

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.070
5,000 PSI is only 3.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.670
So even if I squeeze
this hydrogen gas a ton,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.450
it's still only a tenth of the
energy density of gasoline.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.950
OK.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.180
So that's why storing enough
hydrogen on board is hard.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.950
And it adds a lot of
weight and volume.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.220
And this would be how much--
this is a little less.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.290
This is about 3,000 PSI--

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.900
200 bar-- so that would
be a gas tank of hydrogen,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.910
which is currently how some
car manufacturers are making

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.320
hydrogen powered cars--

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.820
again, $10, $20
million per vehicle--

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.600
that store hydrogen this way.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.060
OK.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.538
If you could liquefy it, you
can get down to smaller tanks.

00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:36.830
What I want to tell you about
is something that I think

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.340
is really exciting here, which
is a chemical storage approach.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.250
OK.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.470
Now, right.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.292
OK.

00:07:48.292 --> 00:07:50.500
Of course, you can imagine
that when you store things

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.970
at this high pressure or at low
temperatures and high pressures

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.900
you have very challenging
engineering and packaging

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.710
issues.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.350
And that's one of
the biggest concerns.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.315
And because there's also
a lot of misunderstanding

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:06.440
of the safety of hydrogen--

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.590
I'm not saying it's
completely safe.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.820
But people actually are
looking at the safety

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.540
of having something
under that much pressure.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.010
OK.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.470
And so actually, when you
have a hydrogen powered car,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.280
you tend to do a drop test,
which isn't really true.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.500
They just are doing drop
tests on the containers

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.250
that they're developing.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.750
And

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.000
They drop it so that
it's going to impact

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.030
the ground at 52 miles an hour.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.039
And I guarantee you that
one exploding drop test,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:45.520
and the market is going to have
some serious issues whatever

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.620
the cause of it is.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.800
But this is a real
concern is the safety--

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.480
forget about whether
it's hydrogen.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.270
But if you store anything
under that high pressure,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.880
there are serious safety
concerns and real packaging

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.620
challenges.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.280
OK.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.370
Remember, it's not just
how the package operates

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.960
when you buy it,
it's how it operates

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.940
after 10 years of
corrosion and operation.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.480
OK.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.390
So I think chemical storage is
a really interesting way to go.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.380
It does not involve
high pressures.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:17.880
OK.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.780
Basically, in chemical
storage, what you have is

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.460
you have essentially a sponge.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.870
You have a material
that soaks hydrogen up.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.730
So it literally just
absorbs hydrogen

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.130
and it changes into a hydride.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.710
And then you pull
the hydrogen back out

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.280
and it's just a sponge.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.520
OK.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.840
Now the problem is that--

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.815
and there are lots
of references.

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:45.940
And there's lots of great
places to read about some

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.523
of this stuff.

00:09:46.523 --> 00:09:49.070
And I've put them here--
put some of them here.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.430
This is a really nice review.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.470
And the problem is if you
look at the periodic table,

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.605
you see a lot of times we're
excited about materials design.

00:09:57.605 --> 00:09:59.230
And we look at the
whole periodic table

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.190
and say, what
should we do today?

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.840
Right?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.100
Don't you all feel that way?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.005
That's how I feel.

00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:06.130
Every morning-- like what
am I going to make today?

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.920
Polonium!

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.400
No.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.230
Ciborium.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.360
Where's ciborium?

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.860
There it is.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.850
OK.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:17.990
That's a neat material.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.660
Ciborium carbide is
higher than diamond.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.530
It's harder than diamond.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.030
Right?

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.980
Now it's a problem
that see ciborium only

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.220
exists for 10 to the minus--

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.650
I don't know-- 5
seconds or something.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.600
But still, for that
short of a time

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.820
you can make really
hard materials with it.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.200
But see-- now-- OK--

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.670
it's a little tangent.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.480
For hydrogen storage, you got a
big problem, which is density.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.980
Right?

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.870
So if you're going
to use a sponge

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.890
to soak hydrogen up and then
release it when you need it

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.440
and then soak it back
up, the sponge can't

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.070
weigh 1,000 times more than
the hydrogen. That's a problem.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.570
Right?

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.390
Because then you're just going
to add thousands of pounds

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.310
of weight to your car.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.720
So that really limits
what you can use.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.350
And so only the light
elements are really

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.520
going to be useful here.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.900
And then you have a short list.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.370
And then you say,
I don't want them

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.180
to be really that poisonous.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.700
It might not be a good thing
in the back of your car.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.040
Right?

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.620
And so then the list--
you can essentially

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.800
argue that the list is about
eight elements that you

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.850
might store.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.100
And that's just not a
lot of room to play.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.510
That's why this is challenging.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.610
As I'm going to show
you, there actually

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.740
is more room than you think.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.390
More and more room
as research goes on.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.610
OK.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.250
And so there are a lot
of materials that do fall

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.510
into-- when you combine these
eight elements together,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.780
you can make many
different materials.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.460
And they do fall into
a range of categories--

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.800
kinds of structures,
kinds of elements,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.085
and so forth that can
pick up hydrogen. Yeah?

00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:53.460
AUDIENCE: I'm
absolutely curious.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.730
What is metallic hydrogen
or how is it made?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well, that's--

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.370
Yeah.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.930
Let me get to the
metal hydrides.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.430
OK.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:11.210
So these are some examples of
the densities you can get to.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.880
OK.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.140
Look at the density of methane.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.860
That's a great hydrogen
storage material.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.990
Why is it totally useless?

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.752
Somebody tell me.

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:23.362
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] carbon.

00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:25.070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, carbon isn't bad.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.420
What?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.350
Not so toxic.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.020
Not a problem.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.100
We can handle that.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.020
AUDIENCE: Explosive.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.895
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK.

00:12:33.895 --> 00:12:34.490
Explosive.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.590
That could be a little
bit of an issue.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.660
We actually like that
it's explosive-- the way

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.190
we use it today.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.365
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:43.990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's hard to densify.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.930
You sort of have
the same problem.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.950
All right.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.050
What if I could
make liquid methane

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.790
at really high densities?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.060
Why would that still be a really
challenging hydrogen storage

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.170
material?

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.880
It's such a great
weight percent density.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.890
Exactly.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.120
You see, a sponge that's going
to-- a chemical sponge that's

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.340
going to absorb hydrogen
and give it back out when

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:16.130
I want it, it's got to be just
the right amount of binding.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.510
It's got to want the hydrogen
just enough to hold onto it

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.080
but not so much that
it won't let it go.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.800
Right?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.110
And it turns out
that's really hard.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.280
That window of binding
is really hard to tune.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.760
And here it's way too
hard, way too high.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.320
So methane-- the carbon is
holding on to those hydrogens.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.440
And you need to go to thousands
of degrees to pull them off.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.570
You're not going to put
a 1,000 degree Celsius

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.070
furnace in your car--

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.800
heating system-- to pull off
the hydrogen. First of all,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.200
you just explode
your gas probably.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.030
But also because it
takes so much energy.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.280
Right?

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.230
So it's the kinetics.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.847
It's getting this
hydrogen in and out

00:13:57.847 --> 00:13:58.930
that has to be just right.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:05.540
And that's where these metal
hydrides are quite interesting.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.880
They have lower densities.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.560
Higher though than
the targets set

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.280
by DOE, which was 6% at
least some years ago.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.990
I forget what their
target is today.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.870
So they're in a pretty good
range to be interesting.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.310
And there's been a lot of work.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.530
And I just put a few kind
of papers and examples here.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.310
There's been a lot of work
on these different materials.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.670
And in particular,
functionalizing materials

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.990
in different ways to
see how they pick up--

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.270
how these kinetics change--
how they pick up hydrogen.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.011
In this case, you're still just
looking at the weight percent.

00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:42.320
OK.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.820
Yeah.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.737
And same in this case.

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:46.190
I'll get to the kinetics
in a few minutes.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.140
These are the sponges.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.160
Look at this.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.750
Sodium alanate doped with
a little bit of titanium

00:14:53.750 --> 00:15:00.280
can give you up to 3.7% or 1.8%,
depending on how you make it.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.530
And that's what it looks like.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.070
There it is before you
fill it up with your fuel.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.905
And there it is
when it's filled up.

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:08.780
And then it's just going
to go back and forth

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.972
and back and forth.

00:15:09.972 --> 00:15:11.180
That's the concept, at least.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.090
So that's basically just
restating what I said.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.130
The metal soaks up and releases
the hydrogen like a sponge.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.460
It becomes a part of
the chemical structure

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.890
of the material, so
it doesn't require

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.560
high pressures or cryogenic
temperatures for operation.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.730
But it's the irreversibility
that's the problem.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.270
How do you get to
the right kinetics?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.090
Now, here's a chart that
I'm not going to go through.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.150
But it's, again, just
more data for you

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.510
to look at, if you want.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.010
And you can see that there's
a lot of work going on here.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.260
There's a lot of really
interesting research going

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.160
on in this area for
looking at materials

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.760
that can form a hydride or not.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.540
So they can-- like
sodium alanate

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.490
can be sodium alanate, just
sodium aluminum, the metal.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:09.770
Or it can soak up the hydrogen.
And this table gives you

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.380
what weight you can expect.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.750
And it gives you things
like what temperature

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.560
are you going to need to
go to get the hydrogen out,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.520
because that's a really
important parameter.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.150
And so I'm going to
finally come to-- oh.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.690
Now, I have a few sides here
that I won't go through.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.880
But they're just here
for you to look at,

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.310
just looking at a few cases
of different materials

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.420
that have gotten a lot of
attention in the last 10 years.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.320
And what I do is I tell
you why they're interesting

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.830
and what their challenges are.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.540
So we go through a few.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.070
There's aluminum hydride.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.650
You go from the pure
aluminum to aluminum hydride,

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.120
back and forth.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.120
You can get up to 10% weight.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.070
But it's almost
completely irreversible.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.320
Now, this is the
interesting thing

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.000
that I want to tell you about.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.640
And this is where you
start to get really

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.420
cool phase space opening up.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.069
Again, that's what I get
really excited about.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.990
You look at a problem in energy.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.069
And you try to find new ways of
opening up material's design,

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.660
axes for designing materials.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.990
And this is one of them.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.569
It turns out that--

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.000
you see in-- let's
take magnesium.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.859
So I showed you
aluminum, sodium.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.050
Here's magnesium,
so another example

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.400
of one of these sponges,
these metal sponges.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.050
And when it's sponged, no,
soaked, it looks like this.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.720
It's got hydrogen in it.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.007
And it's actually a pretty
decent weight percent,

00:17:42.007 --> 00:17:44.060
7.7 weight percent.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.970
The problem is that this
is the amount of energy it

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.820
takes to get the hydrogen out.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.220
That's too much.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.520
What you need for an onboard
hydrogen storage is you

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.890
need that delta
H to be somewhere

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.100
in the range of 20 to
50 kilojoules per mole.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.900
And what is so cool is that--

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.750
what's been shown-- and this
is just a bunch of data.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.990
But I want you to
think size going

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.710
this way and the tuning,
that delta H parameter,

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.270
on this axis.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.120
What's been shown is that,
when it's a bulk material--

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.760
it's out here at 75--

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.512
and as you go down to smaller
sizes, that gets tuned.

00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:28.220
And look at that.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.970
It tunes all the way down into
the point where it's completely

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.200
reversed the stability even.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.740
And so what you see is that,
just by changing the size,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.610
just by nanostructuring the
material, what you're doing

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.830
is you're changing the kinetics.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.200
You're changing the
desorbtion energy

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.080
by changing the size
of the material.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.970
So that's an axis.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.890
That's a tunability axis.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.020
Now, why is this interesting--

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.520
to what?

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.360
To our class.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.550
Why is this interesting
to quantum mechanics?

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.690
Well, because these
are all quantum

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.230
mechanical calculations.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.280
And you can see that, even just
the different levels theory,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.650
oh, you now know what some
of these mean, because these

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.060
are different DFT functionals.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.390
Just look at those, three
different DFT functionals.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.115
Well, they give
you similar trends.

00:19:18.487 --> 00:19:20.570
But you can see that there's
still some variation.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:26.210
If I go to classical potentials,
it's very, very hard to know,

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.910
when I engineer something
into a new domain like this,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.250
if it's right.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.500
So this is really
a problem that's

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.895
best suited for accurate
quantum mechanical methods,

00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:41.270
because you're going to make
a classical potential that's

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.860
fit here, basically.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.710
But all of the interesting
stuff happens as you go down

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.300
to smaller sizes.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.140
So it goes down
into this window.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.483
So notice that I might
want it in this range.

00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:53.900
I might want the
desorbtion energy

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.170
to be in this range, which means
I have a very narrow window

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.090
of size that I can pick.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.870
I better get that
right, that size right,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.510
if I'm going to try to make
predictions of new materials.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.330
And that's where-- again, and
then the phase space opens up

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.260
even more as you talk about--

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.600
this is nanoscaling phase space
that allows you to tune delta

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.810
H. But you can also tune it by
alloying different materials.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.710
So now, you have this
really cool playground.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.220
I have a bunch of different
metals, sodium, aluminum,

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.660
magnesium.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.490
I have size.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.860
And I have composition.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.260
What is going to give
you the best fuel?

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.870
What's going to give
you the best kinetics?

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.200
Perfect problem for computation
and, really, a problem

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.110
that quantum mechanics
is needed for.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:50.280
So that's my 20-minute
hydrogen storage ramble.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.947
Any questions about
it before we move on?

00:20:53.947 --> 00:20:56.280
And I'd be happy to talk more
with people about hydrogen

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.238
storage, if you'd like.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.860
It's cool problems.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.360
OK.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.390
Now, I want to turn to this
goal of going from atoms

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.780
to crystals, to solids.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.990
Now, what we're
going to do today

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:24.320
is just lay some of the basic
theory that we need to know.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.690
And then next week, we're
going to start looking

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.330
at the ramifications of that.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.720
We'll end with a band structure,
which is really exciting.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.090
How many of you have
seen a band structure?

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.170
Yeah.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.760
Is it fun to look
at band structures?

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.350
Have you gotten to that point?

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.660
Yeah, it's really so-so.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.930
We'll get there.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.770
We're going to feel really
excited about band structures,

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.750
because it's just it's
really cool stuff.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.325
And it happens because
you go to that.

00:21:52.325 --> 00:21:53.700
So now, we're at
this point where

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.010
we want to know about
crystals and not

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.950
just atoms and molecules.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:04.710
So what happens that we
talked about so far is this.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.110
We talked about this on Tuesday.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.040
I have my atomic
levels, say, S and P.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.020
And when I bring them
together to form, say,

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.990
a molecule, a dimer,
like H2, well,

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.290
then they can form
combined-- they

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.750
can form molecular orbitals.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.940
So that's the molecule there.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.190
And we talked about how
you can get bonding status

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.857
and antibonding states,
because you have

00:22:30.857 --> 00:22:33.310
wiggles that are overlapping.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.580
And so they can be in phase
and out of phase and so

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.900
forth in the wave functions.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.850
And then you square
it to find out

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.620
the probability distributions.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.780
But now, when I go
to a crystal, you

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.090
see you're taking this
to the next level,

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.750
to the next infinite level.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.090
So now, you don't just
have another atom there,

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.100
you've got an atom everywhere,
all the way out to infinity.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.300
And what ends up happening
is that, as we'll see,

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.280
is that, instead of getting
just these combined molecular

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.270
orbitals that overlap a wave
function with another wave

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.670
function, you get these bands.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.170
You get these bands
of energy states.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.670
And the structure of those
bands is the band structure.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.190
And they're very-- these
don't just look like this.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.390
They actually wiggle, which is
what's really cool about that.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.160
Oh, there's the wiggle.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.180
Yeah, they wiggle.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.400
I mean, that-- I just went
from all doing all this,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.920
drawing this a whole
bunch of times.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.160
And now, I'm saying
they're wiggling.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.240
So they look like this.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.820
How is that possible?

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.240
How can an energy level wiggle?

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.972
What's it wiggling into?

00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:53.180
That's what we're getting to.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.258
That's called reciprocal
space or k-space.

00:23:56.258 --> 00:23:57.800
So that's what we're
going to get to.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:05.390
And I think you all know
this, but, of course,

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.790
when you talk about a
molecule, you don't usually

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.458
talk about a metal.

00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:12.750
I mean, you talk about the
spin states of the molecule.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.890
You can ask whether
it's magnetic or not.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.300
But you don't usually
say it's a metal.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.910
When you have a solid,
well, we know these terms.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.160
It can be an insulator,
which would mean

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.960
that you have bands filled.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.410
And we fill them, just like
in the atoms and molecules.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.880
We get our bands.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.280
We get our wiggles states now.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.880
And we fill those
with electrons,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.550
just like we did with
the atoms and molecules.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.340
And if you fill them up, and
you're in the middle of a band

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.570
when you stop, you're a metal.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.440
If you're here, and you
stop at the top of a band,

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.740
and there's a big jump to the
next band, it's an insulator.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.430
If it's a little jump,
it's a semiconductor.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.240
Anybody know what the gap of
a semiconductor is, typically?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.428
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:59.428 --> 00:25:00.970
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
One point what now?

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.344
Say that again.

00:25:02.344 --> 00:25:04.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.180
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, that
sounds about right, 1 to 3.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.680
And what's an insulator?

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.180
AUDIENCE: Anything
higher than the--

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.400
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Anything higher, maybe?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.410
Yeah, 5, maybe.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.100
Yeah, I love it.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.960
And then there's the term
wide bandgap semiconductor,

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.840
which is really a term
that's used when you really

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.150
wish your material
were a semiconductor.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.818
But it just has
a really big gap.

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.610
And most people would
call it an insulator.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.780
We say, it's a wide
bandgap semiconductor,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.010
so I hope it could be
useful for electronics.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.930
Now, I think most of you
have seen crystal symmetries.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.360
I mean, you certainly
saw it if you took 3012.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.775
How many of you have
not seen crystals?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.580
So this is not about
having a deep understanding

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.878
of crystal symmetries.

00:25:56.878 --> 00:25:58.420
But there is something
important that

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.410
comes about from having periodic
potential, which is the focus.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.340
So I just have--

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.350
I didn't want to go
into details here.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.340
But I will just give you the
very basic elements, again,

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.770
in a couple of minutes.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:15.020
When you have a
repeating pattern,

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.860
you can identify what repeats.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.890
And that's the unit
cell in the crystal.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.790
It's a very powerful way of
picturing an infinite material.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.385
Because how many atoms do I
need to represent silicon?

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.410
How many of you know?

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.910
What's the structure of silicon?

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.762
Anybody know?

00:26:41.762 --> 00:26:43.410
AUDIENCE: Cubic.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Cubic, OK.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.042
AUDIENCE: Tetrahedral?

00:26:46.042 --> 00:26:47.500
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Tetrahedral, yes.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.190
What's the symmetry?

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.460
Come back to that.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.200
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Any others?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.480
We'll come back to it.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.100
But-- oh, yeah, you
have unit cells.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.840
And they get repeated--

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.820
the cell is repeated--

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.180
on the lattice.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:19.630
The lattice defines the
repeatness, the repeatiness,

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.440
repetition.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.900
No, none of those
are good words.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.110
But the lattice
defines how it repeats.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:31.330
Is it going to repeat like
this, in a rectangular way?

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.150
Is it going to repeat
in a square way?

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.980
And you fill all of space.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.640
If you fill all of
space, then it's

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.140
a particular kind of lattice.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.100
Now, because a
crystal is periodic,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.570
the whole point here is we don't
have to model all the atoms.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.290
Because if we did,
we'd need to model 10

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.100
to the 23rd, which
would be a bummer.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.590
And so what's cool is
that, since it's periodic,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:04.720
we can just model the ones
that periodicalize, or repeat.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.220
And these are the
crystal symmetries

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.080
that fill all of space.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.590
So this is all, for those
of you who had 3012,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.790
I know this is just review.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.130
You have, basically,
seven symmetry classes,

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.920
crystal classes, sorry.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.815
Some of you talked about cubic.

00:28:25.815 --> 00:28:27.190
And then you have
different types

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.190
of unit cells, which, basically,
is just whether you have,

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.910
in the repeat cell,
atoms in every corner,

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.300
in every corner in the center,
in the faces, all faces,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.100
some faces.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.032
Those are four options.

00:28:41.032 --> 00:28:42.490
And when you bring
it all together,

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.280
you have 14 of these
kinds of lattices,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.410
which are the ones that
can fill all of space.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:50.820
Those are Bravais lattices.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.470
This is all mostly
review, right?

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.390
And it's not critical.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.650
But, yeah, is this feeling--

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.230
are you feeling good about this?

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.280
Yeah.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.070
You like it.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.770
So here's two different
kinds of crystals.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.630
And then you have the
crystal lattice, which

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.955
is determined by these dots.

00:29:10.955 --> 00:29:13.080
And then you have the basis,
which can be anything.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.850
You can put a basis on the dot.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.910
Now, this is how we're going to
talk to our code, by the way.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.640
When we model a
solid, this is what

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.850
we're going to tell it,
because it needs to know.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.170
It's going to need to know.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.450
When you run your SIESTA
code-- and we'll do that--

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.390
we'll run some SIESTA
calculations next week--

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.570
it's going to want to know
what your lattices, well,

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.130
what symmetry lattice you have.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.510
Is it FCC?

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.970
Is it simple cubic?

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.610
And then it's going to want
to know the lattice spacing.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.400
And then it's going to want to
know everything in your basis.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.280
Is it one atom in your basis?

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.587
Is it like FCC, with
two atoms in your basis,

00:29:50.587 --> 00:29:52.170
which sounds a lot
like silicon to me?

00:29:54.858 --> 00:29:56.650
Or is it something
like, with Mickey Mouse,

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.190
which cannot be entered
into a computer?

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.970
So that's how you're
going to input structures.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.670
Now, here's where it
gets really interesting.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.380
And this is where--

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.500
this is really the
key of today's lecture

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.840
is the next five,
six lines, next bit.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.080
There is something called an
inverse lattice, which is also

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.100
called reciprocal space.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.170
And I think because--

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.800
I think you did learn all
this, if you had 3012, yes?

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.790
So you all feel--

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.400
do you feel your oneness
with reciprocal space?

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.520
Yeah, I'm seeing
some strong nods

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.580
and some not-so-strong nods.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.420
So this is a really
important concept

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.370
that, essentially, gives this.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.800
It gives us the wiggles.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.400
This reciprocal
space is the language

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.310
we need to describe the wiggles.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.670
So just to review
for most of you,

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.700
with each real space lattice,
like the square that I

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.400
showed you, you can make
a reciprocal lattice.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.890
And it's the set
of vectors that are

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.600
commensurate with the
real space lattice.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.280
And you can define them
very, very ingeniously.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.714
If the real space lattice
is vectors a, b, and c--

00:31:18.714 --> 00:31:21.850
oh, like here,
it's a 2D lattice.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.780
So this would be like a.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.990
That would be vector a.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.606
And maybe, this
would be vector b.

00:31:29.606 --> 00:31:30.730
This would be vector b.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.230
Which one?

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.730
Any thoughts?

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.160
We're just brushing up here.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.330
But you call them a
star, b star, and c star.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.200
And the way they're defined
is in a very important way.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.360
First of all, a star--

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.270
that's the reciprocal
vector-- times a is 1.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.110
So there's a normalization.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.610
And secondly, there's something
a little more mathematically

00:31:55.610 --> 00:32:00.410
rigorous, which is that it's the
cross product of the other two.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:04.630
So a star is the cross
product of b and c.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.050
b star is the cross
product of c and a.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.013
So you can write down--

00:32:10.013 --> 00:32:11.680
basically, when you
have your real space

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.480
lattice and-- hello there.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.560
[DOOR CLOSES]

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.340
Why do I have those little n's
there in front of those vectors

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.640
to define my real space lattice?

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.500
This is what we use
to talk about lattice?

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.630
Why are those n's there?

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.480
AUDIENCE: Signify
the twilight zone.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.370
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
The twilight zone?

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.240
Very good guess.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.684
What does n usually mean
when I put it in an equation?

00:32:45.684 --> 00:32:46.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.260
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: A what number?

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:48.650
AUDIENCE: Integer.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.940
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Some integer, yeah.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.570
Why?

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.010
I don't know.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.150
We just like n for integer.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.780
It just happened.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.330
So why would those be integers?

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.630
a1, a2, a3 are the
vectors of the lattice.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.120
And now, I have integers there.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.370
Why?

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.865
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:08.865 --> 00:33:10.990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
because this is my lattice.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.400
This is my lattice.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.490
It goes off to infinity.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:22.630
so it's n is 1 to get here,
2 get there, 3 to get there.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.610
That's why it's n.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.770
It's an integer times
the lattice factor.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:30.700
And it gets me to any
other lattice point,

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.310
depending on what my n's are.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:38.890
Now, the same-- in
reciprocal space,

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.890
you construct another
lattice, which

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.540
is given by these mathematical
expressions, as I said,

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.880
just cross products
of the first lattice.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.830
And you get a
reciprocal lattice,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:55.780
which we like to call G.
We say that those have

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.000
their own lattice vectors and
their own integers in front

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.070
that take you anywhere you
want in the reciprocal lattice.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.670
Now, a couple of
important things, one

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.800
is, if I take e
to the iG.R, where

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.570
R is a lattice
vector in real space,

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:23.290
and G is a lattice vector in
reciprocal space, I get 1.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.670
That's important.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.969
You'll see in a minute why.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:32.810
But also, if I happen
to write a function that

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.050
looks like something like this,
where I have it as an exponent,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.110
e to the i some
reciprocal lattice vector

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.830
times R, where R can now
be anywhere in real space--

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.780
R is just a vector--

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.040
it's not a lattice vector--

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.380
then that function
will automatically

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.370
be periodic in the real space.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.150
Isn't that cool?

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.492
That function will
automatically be periodic.

00:34:57.492 --> 00:34:59.200
That sounds like
something we might want.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.790
Now, here's a simple picture.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.730
This is a real
space BCC lattice.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.670
And when I construct the
inverse lattice using

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.250
the mathematical rules
I just showed you,

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.040
I get this, which is cool.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.930
BCC turns into FCC.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.460
When you do the
inverse lattice, you

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.870
get a new lattice,
which happens to be FCC.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:37.670
So it's just a new space,
but it's reciprocal space.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.930
Now, why is this so important?

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.800
We're getting there.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:49.660
Within this reciprocal
space, you can define a zone.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.110
And you can define
it very simply.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.340
You just draw-- you just
go out to your-- you

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.480
just go out to the
next point here.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.380
And you draw your
bisection lines.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.630
So you go out to these points.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.690
And you draw lines.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.230
In this case, it's a 2D lattice.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.310
So the area that's
carved out is a zone.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.075
And that, when you do it with
just to the first neighbors,

00:36:15.075 --> 00:36:18.630
when you do it like that,
and you draw the lines,

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.120
you get the Brillouin zone.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.900
Did you guys talk about
Brillouin zone in the fall?

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.350
It's just this very
first zone, first--

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.250
I don't want to get
too technical here.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.680
But it's the zone we care
about in the calculations.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.500
This part of the
reciprocal space

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.160
is all we need,
this Brillouin zone.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:50.570
He was a cool guy.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:57.260
And you can go out--
you can keep doing this

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.760
and go to the next
nearest neighbors

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.720
and drop bisecting lines
and create the next volume.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.370
And here are just
a few examples.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.067
The first Brillouin
zone is what we're

00:37:07.067 --> 00:37:08.150
going to be interested in.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:15.020
This is what it looks like
for BCC and FCC lattices.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.690
And then you can go out to
further and further points.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.910
And you get some really
interesting volumes here.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.790
Again, I'm not going to
go too much into this.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.340
But we do care about
this Brillouin zone.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.685
And I'll tell you why when
we get to the band structure.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.200
No, I'll tell you why right now.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.150
You see-- and then
I'll come back to it,

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.240
because it might not make
total sense right now--

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.130
you see, the Brillouin
zone is an area of--

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:55.770
it's a volume, in 3D, of
space, of reciprocal space, not

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.180
real space, reciprocal space.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.110
And what ends up
happening-- so again,

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.060
I'm jumping to the
punchline here--

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.190
but I want to tell to
you while you're thinking

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.800
about this Brillouin zone--

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.420
is that, you see, when you
move around in reciprocal space

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.500
within this first Brillouin
zone, what ends up happening

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.760
is that the wave function
can change, depending

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.410
on where it is in that zone.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:32.087
Now, that's a result of
having a periodic potential

00:38:32.087 --> 00:38:33.920
and this thing called
Bloch's Theorem, which

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.890
we're going to talk about next.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:42.320
But that is what leads the
variation in the energies

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.390
is what leads to the curviness.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:49.400
This curviness, if you
want to think about it,

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:59.320
is a tour through
the Brillouin zone.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.530
I take a tour through
this special zone

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.220
in reciprocal space.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:09.150
And I find that the
wave function varies.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.900
So I may take a tour by going
from the middle of the zone

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.370
out to one of these edges.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.750
Maybe I'll go up to the middle
of the plane here of the phase

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.970
and back to the edge.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:23.790
And you cruise around
this Brillouin zone.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.800
And that's what
gives you wiggles.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.870
That's how you get the wiggles.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.690
I mean, the crystal is
what gives you the wiggles.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.450
The way you calculate
them is by cruising around

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.370
in reciprocal space in the code.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:47.060
By the way, in this
part of the class,

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.450
I'm very purposefully not
going into technical details

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.200
of the codes.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.500
However, if anyone
is interested,

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.690
I would be very happy
to work with you

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:00.200
or share with you more details
about how the codes are doing

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.250
these calculations, what's the
math under the hood, what kind

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.960
of loops are happening.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.800
And you're certainly
welcome to download codes.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.320
There are free ones that--

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:18.930
for solids, you can download,
for free, SIESTA, which

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.410
is what's running on the hub.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.690
You can download PWSCF.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.770
You can download ABINIT.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.880
These are just a few
that come to mind.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.523
They're free.

00:40:30.523 --> 00:40:31.440
You can download them.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.570
Most of them, I think you
can run on your laptop.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.160
And if you're
interested in going more

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.743
under the hood in the codes, I'd
be very happy to talk to you.

00:40:37.743 --> 00:40:40.500
But that's not the focus
of this part of the class,

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.880
as I've said.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.200
For molecules-- as I've said,
there are many codes here--

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.270
this is just a very
short list-- but there's

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:58.390
GAMES and NWCHEM, which are
a few that come to mind,

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.320
both free.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.420
And then there are
bunch that you pay for.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.270
If you want to spend
some money, if you

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:09.570
got 5, 10 grand to spare,
first, come see me and--

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:10.644 --> 00:41:12.880
--I'm kidding.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.150
But you can buy VASP.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:21.370
Or you could buy a
code called Gaussian,

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.890
which are both-- we heavily
use VASP in my group.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.390
These are very good
codes, actually.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.683
But they cost money.

00:41:26.683 --> 00:41:28.600
They have some-- these
different codes are all

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.300
doing the same thing.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.550
They're all doing Schrodinger.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:35.010
And they're all using their
approximations we talked about.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.840
And they have different
advantages and disadvantages,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.200
which, again, I'd be happy
to talk with people about,

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.770
if they'd like to
dig a little deeper.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.430
Now, all of this stuff
about the Brillouin zone,

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.730
which comes from the
symmetries of the crystal,

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:55.170
comes into play because we
have periodic potentials.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.090
That's it.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:57.930
That's the point.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:11.600
So I now went from a potential
that looks like this.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.360
Well, let me try to--

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.440
if there's an atom here,
there's a potential well

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.860
that an electron might feel as
it gets attracted to the atom.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.750
And I went from putting, maybe,
two atoms together to now

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.788
having an array of them
that go out to infinity.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.050
Now, that has repercussions.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.590
And so the potential,
now, can be written.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:46.690
So you could try to
write the whole thing out

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.130
as a function of all of space.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.130
Or you can just say,
hey, for every plus R,

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.520
I get back to V, because
that's basically what it is.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.290
It's a periodic
potential in the lattice.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.640
So the potential now, every
R, which is a lattice vector,

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.800
is the same.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.440
Now, it turns out this is
actually really hard to solve.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.490
And in textbooks, in
quantum textbooks,

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:14.740
like if you take a solid state
physics class, what you'll see

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.030
is that they'll show
this picture, especially

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.767
from a long time ago--

00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:22.600
there's some really
good solid state physics

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.590
texts from the '70s.

00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:27.520
And you look at some
of those older ones,

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.895
they'll show those pictures,
say, it's too hard to solve.

00:43:29.895 --> 00:43:31.840
And I love that, because
it's not anymore,

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.130
because we can use
computers to do it,

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.700
which is what we're going
to do in this class.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.058
But back then, and
even longer before,

00:43:39.058 --> 00:43:40.100
it was too hard to solve.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:48.880
And so people would basically
model a crystal going back

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.150
exactly to the problem of
an atom and the potentials

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.650
being so hard to
solve analytically

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.730
unless they're simple.

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.050
They simplified this.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.700
And if you make
it a periodically

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.740
repeating square
well like that, you

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.400
could solve it analytically.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.080
And for those of you
who are interested,

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.610
this is called the
Kronig-Penney model.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.960
And you can look up--

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.460
I think that's how
you spell Penney.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.040
You could look up the solution
to that online, if you want.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.850
It won't happen-- we're not
going to do it in the class.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.780
But beyond simple
things like this,

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.830
which is not a very realistic
crystal, although you

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:32.750
do get some key physical meaning
out of this, beyond that,

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:39.210
you need a computer, which
I think is pretty cool.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.890
So now, we get to
Bloch's Theorem,

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:47.340
which is what gets us to
this dependence, this wiggle,

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.570
this wiggle.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.060
So we're setting it up.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.650
We have reciprocal space.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:57.000
We defined this first
zone in reciprocal space.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.700
We said that, if you go through
the zone, things change.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.650
Bloch's Theorem is the reason.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.540
It's the reason
why things change

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.950
as you tour through this zone.

00:45:07.558 --> 00:45:09.850
There are different ways to
talk about Bloch's Theorem.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.650
Here's a fairly simple
way to look at it.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.620
So if you write the reciprocal
lattice vector like this,

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.320
2 pi-- and the
2's are just there

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.630
to make math a
little easier, so you

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.070
can write it however you want.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.170
This is that integer.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.690
There's the reciprocal
lattice vector.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:34.950
If you write it like that, then,
if you take this exponential--

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.420
[SNEEZE]

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:42.020
--gesundheit-- which I've
already alluded to before,

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.260
and you do that,
actually, explicitly out.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.230
So R is a vector in real space.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.540
R is a vector in real space.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.880
Now, if I dot R with G, which
is a reciprocal lattice vector,

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.520
then I get the reciprocal
lattice vector dot that.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.660
And that's just alpha, beta,
gamma, or just the coefficients

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.370
of the real space
lattice vector,

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.538
because R will be
somewhere in real space.

00:46:08.538 --> 00:46:11.080
And so I can represent it, in
terms of the real space lattice

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.710
vectors time some coefficients.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:17.770
And what you can see when you
do this, it's very simple math.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:19.870
What you can see is
that, as you vary where

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.440
you are in real space,
then, well, these things

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.340
are going to change.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.040
Alpha, beta, and gamma would
change between, say, 0 and 1.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.350
And the function e to
the iG.r changes as well.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:40.100
But you can see from
this little derivation

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.720
that, since these are integers,
this function is always going

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.990
to vary with the periodicity.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.000
So this is what I said.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.530
Here's the math behind it.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.090
I said this before.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.020
So you now have a
function, e to the iG.R

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.343
And that's the reason why.

00:46:56.343 --> 00:46:58.260
If you just spend a few
minutes staring at it,

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.980
you'll see why this is true.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.745
You have a way of making
a function automatically

00:47:03.745 --> 00:47:04.245
periodic.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:11.030
Now, why do I care?

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:14.410
Well, because if I
have this periodicity,

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:17.020
if I have this ordering--

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.700
here, it's drawn is
an approximation.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.840
Here, it's drawn as
maybe more realistic,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.150
what my potentials look like.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:32.740
Then the values of some
function, like the density,

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.020
should be what at
each lattice site?

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.320
Well, I have it there in blue.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.283
AUDIENCE: They'd be
identical [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:41.283 --> 00:47:42.450
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Thank you.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.240
Thank you very much.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.910
Now, that seems obvious.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.980
I mean, I've got,
basically, an array

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.460
that goes on forever that's
the same every lattice vector.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.030
It's just the same thing.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.390
This is a pure, perfect crystal.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:03.480
There are no defects.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.200
It's completely unrealistic,
because, as you all know,

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.820
there are defects in reality.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.382
But we can put those into
the simulation as well.

00:48:11.382 --> 00:48:13.215
But for this derivation,
there's no defects.

00:48:13.215 --> 00:48:15.640
So you have infinite crystal.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.780
And what that means is that,
everywhere, the properties

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.600
should be the same.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.300
If I sit on this atom or this
atom or in between these two

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.175
and then in between
those two, the properties

00:48:24.175 --> 00:48:27.000
should be the same, if I
go by a lattice vector.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.230
Here's the kicker, though.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.720
The wave function
is not the same.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.150
And that's really the key.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:38.030
The wave function
is not the same.

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.800
It's almost the
same, but it's not.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.430
It's periodic.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.320
The wave function
is periodic but only

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.160
when it's multiplied
by a phase factor.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.710
And that is Bloch's Theorem.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.460
And there are three
or four different ways

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.450
that it can be derived.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.670
I will post them onto
the Stellar website.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.150
They're not something you need
to know for quiz or homework.

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.650
But that is Bloch's Theorem.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.280
It's that the wave function
in a infinitely repeating

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:12.800
periodic crystal is going
to equal some function that

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.450
is periodic, some
function that's

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.810
periodic that has the
periodicity of the lattice,

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.620
some function, u,
times the phase.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.570
And that, this is
that function u.

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.430
You see, it's periodic.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:32.900
It equals it, if you go plus
big R, plus one lattice vector.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.817
So if you move over by a whole--

00:49:34.817 --> 00:49:36.400
when I see lattice
vector, by the way,

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.780
let's bring it to reality.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.860
I just mean if
silicon were cubic,

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.790
I'd just be going from one
silicon atom to another.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:45.790
That's a lattice vector.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:54.570
And simple cubic, I'm thinking.

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:57.600
And so you have a
function that also

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.980
is the same in that
lattice distance,

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:04.040
as you go from, say, one atom
to another in the simplest case.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.140
But the wave function
is that times the phase.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.940
And that's really
important, because that

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.620
brings in a new variable.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.980
In fact, this is a
new quantum number.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.480
That brings in a
new quantum number.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.840
This is a quantum number, k,
that lives in inverse space.

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:38.500
So Bloch's Theorem says that,
if I go from one point in space

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.220
to another point that's
translated by just a lattice

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:48.430
factor, then I equal my original
wave function time this phase.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.750
And you can show--

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.280
I mean, this is
actually trivial,

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.360
because this is
a complex number.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.570
So when you square
it, you can show

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.390
that the squares are the same,
which is really important.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:02.290
The charge density in
the lattice is periodic.

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:04.930
Does everybody see that?

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.150
The charge density in a
crystal should be periodic.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.880
Between any two
silicon atoms, the bond

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.510
is the same for as long as
you can see, 10 to 23rd bonds.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.580
It's a whole lot of sameness.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.860
And you can see that the
equations show that it is.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:23.960
But the wave function
can vary by this phase.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.630
You can also show that if
psi k, this thing that I'm

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.530
going to talk about more, is
a solution to the Schrodinger

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.913
equation, then psi k
plus any reciprocal--

00:51:37.913 --> 00:51:39.080
this is a reciprocal number.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.370
Remember, this is a number.

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:44.570
k is a vector in
reciprocal space.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.610
That's the Bloch's Theorem.

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:50.450
That's a reciprocal vector
that lives in reciprocal space

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.860
dotted with the lattice vector.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.610
And if I add the reciprocal
lattice vector to it,

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.630
then that also
must be a solution.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:03.470
So that's also another
consequence of Bloch's Theorem.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:06.215
So here's the--

00:52:06.215 --> 00:52:08.480
I know some of you
might not quite

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.580
be feeling your
oneness with this.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.020
That's fine.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:15.830
We'll talk about this a
little bit more next week.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.480
I don't need you to go into
great fundamental depth

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.030
in Bloch's Theorem
and how it's derived.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:25.490
And I'll show you,
you can basically--

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:33.200
because proper derivations
require some more knowledge

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.950
of quantum mechanics.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:38.590
And I'm trying to avoid that.

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.950
But basically, one of the
easiest ways to look at it

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.910
mathematically is that
the translation vector

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:48.150
associated with the lattice
commutes with the Hamiltonian.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.060
Anybody know what that means?

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:51.560
Yeah?

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:55.027
AUDIENCE: Is that like
how we take ab equals ba?

00:52:55.027 --> 00:52:56.360
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, kind of.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.840
Yeah, so you can switch the
order of the operations.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.670
But that's, again, not--

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.590
we don't need to know that.

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.270
What we need to know is this.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.160
This is what we need to know.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.300
This is the punchline of it all.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.860
So we've gone through
some derivation.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.005
We won't do more
much more derivation.

00:53:15.005 --> 00:53:16.130
But this is the punch line.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.838
This is what you got
to take out of this,

00:53:17.838 --> 00:53:20.900
so please do take this away.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.310
When we had hydrogen atoms,
when we solved the Schrodinger

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:29.030
equation for a
hydrogen atom, we saw

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.550
that the way we did it was we
imposed spherical symmetry.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.070
So we had a symmetry.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.570
We did have a symmetry.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:39.200
It wasn't a crystal
symmetry, which I showed you,

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.340
14 Bravais lattices.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.200
But it was a
symmetry, spherical.

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.550
And when I imposed that, we saw
that there are-- these quantum

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.650
numbers came out, remember?

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:49.350
We did that.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.930
And that was so
cool, because it just

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.140
solved so many of the
issues of the time,

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.780
just the fact that
electrons were quantized

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.400
was so important.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.180
All right.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:03.070
Now, we have a new
kind of symmetry.

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:05.185
We have something called
translational symmetry.

00:54:05.185 --> 00:54:07.060
We're still solving the
Schrodinger equation,

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.590
but now it's a periodic solid.

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:11.320
And when this kind of
symmetry is in the game,

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:15.680
we have a different
kind of quantum number.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.970
That's what matters most here.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.800
We have a different
kind of quantum number.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:25.340
We have a quantum number that
is a reciprocal lattice vector.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.850
It's a vector in
reciprocal space.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.560
That's the key.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.260
And because we
have-- you see, just

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:37.100
like-- so these l's and
m's had their rules.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.860
This could be plus or minus
that and so forth and so on.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.210
And so you could--

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:44.960
they lived within I don't know.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.180
They lived within
in the counting

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:50.610
of the principal quantum number.

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:52.150
Now, we have a
different situation.

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:55.260
We have a quantum
number that can vary.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.330
It doesn't have to just be 0, 1.

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:00.750
Or it's not necessarily tied to
the principle quantum number.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.040
But it can vary.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:07.170
And its domain of varying
is that Brillouin zone.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:07.830
That's it.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.900
So that's where it can play.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.717
These guys have
variations dictated

00:55:14.717 --> 00:55:16.050
by the principal quantum number.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.660
This has variations dictated
by the Brillouin zone.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:23.480
That's really the key
here, the Brillouin zone,

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.805
which comes about
from reciprocal space.

00:55:26.805 --> 00:55:27.680
Is everybody with me?

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.500
Well, here's just a drawing.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.740
I don't even know where--

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.840
I should really have
a reference here.

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.428
This is one of my
Google image searches.

00:55:44.428 --> 00:55:45.220
And there are many.

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.140
And you can look
at drawings online.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:51.970
But if you have a very
simple wave function--

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.680
that's the real and
imaginary parts--

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.800
and you have some periodically
repeating function--

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.160
so that's my psi, and that's
my periodic function--

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.830
then you can get a
sense of this variation

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.750
that I'm talking about.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:08.390
This is a very simple
one-dimensional example.

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:11.120
So I have a one-dimensional
wave function.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.830
And I have a periodically
repeating function.

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.830
And remember, what
Bloch's Theorem says

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.350
is that that is
now how I'm going

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:20.480
to write a solution to
the Schrodinger equation.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:26.210
It's going to be a combination
of a plane wave like that,

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:28.440
where k is in the
reciprocal space,

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.440
and some periodically
repeating function.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.110
And just to illustrate that you
can get variation now, check

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:40.310
out what happens when I change
k from, say, something not

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:43.560
equal to 0 to something
like pi over a,

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.850
you can see that these
functions change dramatically.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:52.010
The wave function of
the crystal changes.

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.850
Everybody see that?

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.893
So that's really important.

00:56:57.893 --> 00:56:59.810
And the reason that's
important and the reason

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:03.050
this is all going to come
home for us as we move on

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:09.800
to seeing why this all matters
is that that means you have

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:16.380
energies that also depend on k.

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:22.580
The energies also depend on this
variation in reciprocal space.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.420
All right.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.230
So now, if I'm in
reciprocal space,

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.380
and I move from the
origin out to the edge

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:30.410
of the Brillouin zone, not
only am I changing my function,

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.210
I'm changing this.

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:38.360
I'm changing-- the position
of this level can vary now.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.260
It now can vary.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:42.770
It can move up or down.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:49.535
And that's the key
result, the one that's

00:57:49.535 --> 00:57:50.660
going to matter most to us.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:00.870
Is everybody-- any questions?

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:01.563
This is-- yeah?

00:58:01.563 --> 00:58:03.230
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, is the k

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.688
right here that
we're dealing with,

00:58:04.688 --> 00:58:06.865
is that the same as
the crystal momentum?

00:58:06.865 --> 00:58:08.240
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Very good, yes,

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.860
the crystal momentum would
be that times h bar, yes,

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:17.220
which is like momentum,
kind of, but not really.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.032
But it is, sort of.

00:58:19.032 --> 00:58:19.740
AUDIENCE: So it--

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.745
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Quasi
is a good word, momentum.

00:58:23.745 --> 00:58:26.872
AUDIENCE: So it it an
inverse lattice vector or--

00:58:26.872 --> 00:58:27.830
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:29.606
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:31.790
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Ah,
well, that is exactly it,

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.740
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:44.100
And you can get a feel for--

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:50.970
as you vary k, so then things
happen, like the momentum

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.970
can change.

00:58:53.970 --> 00:59:00.140
And that means the
velocity can change.

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.330
And if the velocity can change--

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:06.290
well, actually, the
mass can change as well.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.390
And if those things can change--

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:09.890
of course, it's not
really changing.

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:12.020
The mass of the electron
isn't really changing.

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:16.910
But the effective mass, the mass
that it feels in the crystal,

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:18.460
is changing.

00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.940
And, boy, is that important.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:24.910
And we'll talk about that,
because, from the way that--

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.670
here's my levels in
an atom or molecule.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:30.340
And now, remember, I
said that they do this.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:35.420
From the way they do this, how
heavy an electron feels itself

00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.930
to be in the crystal varies.

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:44.830
It has an effective mass that's
dependent on the wiggles here.

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:47.610
And because of that,
that's directly related

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:51.090
to how fast an electron can
cruise through the crystal.

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:53.620
It's directly related
to the mobility.

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.530
So the transport
properties are deeply

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:58.110
dependent on this wiggling.

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.000
So Bloch's Theorem
is a formal theorem

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.060
that tells you that you have
to write wave functions in such

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:10.050
a way that you have a dependence
on the inverse lattice.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:16.680
And then how that dependence
enters into a system

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.050
or a material is very complex.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.300
And it depends on solving
the Schrodinger equation

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.008
for the material.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:30.020
But you see, you can think
about it like this, if you want.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.730
Here's my inverse space.

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:36.030
And I'm going to change where
I am in reciprocal space.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.180
Remember, again, I only
have reciprocal space

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.870
because I have a crystal.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.660
I have a lattice.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.160
So I have an inverse space.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.380
And if I change where
I am in inverse space,

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.620
these would be my
new energy levels.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.880
You get a new set
of energy levels,

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.160
those e's that I just showed
you, for every point in space,

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.050
in k-space, every
point in k-space.

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.870
So now, this is just blown up.

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:05.440
It used to be the good
old days, last Thursday.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.120
We just had these levels.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.330
We just got through talking
about how you get these from--

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.490
you can build up two
atoms, three atoms.

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:13.780
And you get these levels.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.140
And they didn't go anywhere.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.890
And now, they've blown up,
because anywhere you go

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.270
in this reciprocal
space, they can change.

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.030
They can change.

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:26.170
So now, you need to
compute those same levels

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:30.310
in the computer for
different points in k-space.

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:33.670
And that's what a computer does
when it solves for a solid.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.720
That's what it does.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.390
That's basically the
difference, is you now

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:41.680
have an extra degree of
freedom that you didn't have

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.330
in your atoms and molecules
or an extra quantum number

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.830
that you need to explore, k.

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:51.390
So what are my levels at 0?

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.650
Well, there are these.

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:53.440
I don't know.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.480
Well, they're not here.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.320
What are my levels here?

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.070
They look like this.

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:57.070
Here, they look at this.

01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:58.740
And that's how the
computer does it.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.240
It computes the same thing.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.970
It computes the energy
levels, fills them up.

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:05.850
But at each point in k-space,
they can be different.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.850
And this is exactly
that difference.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.650
You change where
you are in k-space.

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:11.460
And look at that.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.680
This level starts going down.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.650
This level goes up.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:18.040
I don't know what's
going on here.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.270
Maybe that's this one.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.230
That one's going up.

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:24.360
All kinds of things can
happen as you cruise around

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.890
phase space, in k-space.

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:30.420
Those energy levels will change.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.947
And that is what leads
to a band structure.

01:02:32.947 --> 01:02:34.280
That's what a band structure is.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.960
It's just a continuous
change of energy levels

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.220
as a function of k-space.

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:54.690
And each of these bands is
still just an energy level.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.150
So how many
electrons go into it?

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:59.210
Still just an energy
level, it's just

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:02.600
a weird one that wiggles
depending on where you

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.310
are in the reciprocal lattice.

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:06.590
But how many electrons
do I put into this band

01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:09.310
as I fill them up?

01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:13.510
Two, I still just put
two electrons in here.

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.160
And then I put two
electrons in here.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.577
And then I put two
electrons here.

01:03:16.577 --> 01:03:17.500
Oh, but look at that.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.420
It was actually two bands.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.350
That's tricky.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:23.890
So you get these really
interesting behaviors,

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:26.320
where bands can merge
and become degenerate.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.880
Ah, but that's not really
that different, is it,

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.040
then the idea that
you could have

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.700
states like this, where I had--
this is just the atom, 1S 2S,

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.200
2P.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.360
I had three energy bands
that had the same energy.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.980
That's called degeneracy.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.080
Here it is in the hydrogen atom.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.360
There it is in a
very complex crystal.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.490
Well, it's actually
a simple crystal.

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:57.470
So you have
degeneracies, where--

01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:01.190
these would be like two levels
that are the same energy.

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.860
But now, I'm cruising
around in k-space.

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.100
And I get to a part of
k-space where they no longer

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:07.680
are the same.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.720
They actually split.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.650
This one goes down.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:13.100
And these two go up, let's say.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.260
And so their degeneracy splits.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.740
And you see that all the
time in band structures.

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.930
But there are a certain
number of total levels here.

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:23.347
And you fill them
up, just like we

01:04:23.347 --> 01:04:26.190
did for an atom or a molecule.

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:30.570
Now, somebody tell me what--
so that's a band structure.

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:35.090
We'll talk about the band
structure in all of its glory

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:35.810
next week.

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:36.980
But we're not done.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:41.380
Somebody tell me-- by the way,
this is a beautiful thing.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.230
Are we feeling that?

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:47.250
I mean, is it a little
emotional moment for you

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.170
guys, a little bit?

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.160
Yeah?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.100
I felt that.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.710
There's so much in
the band structure.

01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:59.310
There is so much
material science, so much

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:01.570
physics and chemistry,
in this band structure,

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:04.170
so much to learn about a
material, just from this.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.940
So we still have
occupied and unoccupied.

01:05:14.907 --> 01:05:16.240
That wasn't supposed to do that.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.500
Oh, why is it doing that?

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.055
OK, there we go.

01:05:24.055 --> 01:05:26.180
So you still-- that's what
I was saying-- you still

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.560
will fill them up.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.880
And then you'll have--

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.950
what is that?

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:30.700
AUDIENCE: Bandgap.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.130
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's the bandgap.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.470
But what's interesting
about this bandgap?

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.970
Yes?

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:37.970
AUDIENCE: It's indirect.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:39.670
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's indirect.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:44.500
And now, that's what
indirect means, you see.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.320
Can I get an indirect--
remember, we had the molecules.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.980
We had the molecules.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.400
This is a molecule.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.890
Those are my energy
levels of a molecule.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:57.810
And this was the gap.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.592
Can I have an indirect
bandgap in a molecule?

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:11.024
What do you think?

01:06:11.024 --> 01:06:13.940
AUDIENCE: If it's a
molecule of silicon.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.260
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well, even
if it's a molecule silicon,

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.925
can I have an indirect bandgap?

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:24.149
Why not?

01:06:24.149 --> 01:06:25.570
AUDIENCE: It's not periodic.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:26.470
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's not periodic.

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:27.010
Therefore?

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:28.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:31.550
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
there is nothing to vary.

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:35.830
K-space does
nothing for me here.

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:39.720
Yeah?

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.012
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
what an indirect bandgap is?

01:06:42.012 --> 01:06:43.720
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.137
And I'm going to
talk about a lot.

01:06:45.137 --> 01:06:46.940
Yeah, sorry, I jumped
a little ahead.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.220
I get a little excited.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.510
Indirect bandgap is
such a cool thing.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:54.560
And it's such a pain
point in silicon.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.660
You see, if I want--

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.250
what you're going
to do in homework 2,

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.620
and what we talked about
last Thursday, is that,

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.190
if I shine light onto
this material-- remember,

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.020
these are all occupied--

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.260
what I can do is kick an
electron up in energy.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.210
That's a photoexcitation.

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:13.010
And that's what allows
me to store energy

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.510
from the sun in the
molecules you're

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:18.180
going to work on in
your next problem set.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.630
But you see, that's
just a direct bandgap.

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.500
Why is it direct?

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.620
Well, because it's
just the bandgap.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.540
In a molecule, there's
no direct or indirect.

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.542
But this is direct,
because you just

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:30.750
have the energy from the sun.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:34.260
And that's the energy
that it needs to go up.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:40.280
Now, when you have k-space,
things are different.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.000
Because now, these things,
these energies, they wiggle.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.800
And here's the kicker.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.090
You see, what's the gap
now of this material?

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.757
Well, here, they wiggle.

01:07:57.757 --> 01:07:59.090
Don't look at that for a second.

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:00.970
Just look at this.

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.590
I now don't have a molecule.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:06.280
I have a periodically
repeating solid.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.510
And therefore, I get these
wiggles of each energy band.

01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:12.190
And now, I shine light on it.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:13.480
Where does this electron go?

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.180
Is this the gap of the material?

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.109
That's the key.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:17.979
Is that the gap?

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.170
Well, it's the gap at
this point in k-space.

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.240
But here's the real
important part.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.700
There is a lower energy
gap in this material.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.479
If I'm able to go from
this point k-space

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.319
to this point in k-space,
then the gap is only this big.

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:49.580
This would be
called a direct gap.

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.220
And this would be
called an indirect gap.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:04.893
And that is why silicon
solar cells are expensive.

01:09:04.893 --> 01:09:06.310
We will talk about
that next week.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:10.420
But that's why silicon
solar cells are expensive.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:18.880
You see, when you have to go
to a different part of k-space

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.750
to create your excitation,
well, you need help.

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.880
You can't do it with just light.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.560
You need some assistance.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.729
You've got to call it in.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:33.017
And that means it's
a lot harder to do

01:09:33.017 --> 01:09:34.809
and, therefore, a very
inefficient process.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.130
And as we talked
about last week,

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:40.600
and as you'll do
in your homework,

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.840
you want to absorb as much
of that sunlight from the sun

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.460
as you can.

01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:50.050
So if your gap--

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.698
our next application-- not
Tuesday but probably next

01:09:52.698 --> 01:09:54.490
Thursday, we might
start to talk about it--

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.830
will be solar cells.

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:58.690
And we'll talk about
solar cells then.

01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:03.460
But you don't want your bandgap
to be too high, because if it's

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.097
really high,
remember, you're not

01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:06.430
going to absorb much of the sun.

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.600
Now, it also can't
be 0 or close to 0

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:18.180
for a similar reason of the
solar fuels but different.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.480
But it's related.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.340
And we'll get to that later.

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:27.840
But the point is that this gap
is very high for a solar cell.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.830
This is a big gap.

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:30.990
You want it to have a small gap.

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:32.280
It does have a small gap.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.720
Silicon does have a small
gap from here to here, 1.1,

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.710
beautiful EV.

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.610
But it needs to call it in.

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:45.050
It needs help.

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.780
It can't just get that
from the light alone.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.830
And therefore, that's a very low
efficiency process and a very

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.520
low probability process.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.180
So yes, it can absorb
light, if it has

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.430
help at those lower energies.

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.620
But it's very infrequent.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.140
It's very improbable.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.550
And that indirect bandgap is
the reason why silicon is not

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:12.560
a good optical
absorber, does not

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.500
absorb light efficiently in
the parts of the spectrum

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500
that you'd like it to.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.810
It can absorb light, if
you make it thick enough

01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:21.610
in that part of the spectrum.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.990
But that's not what
you want to do.

01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:25.120
But you got to do it.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.842
So that's the indirect bandgap.

01:11:26.842 --> 01:11:28.300
Now, does everybody
see-- but, see,

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.440
it has a direct gap at gamma.

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.440
Does everybody see this?

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.725
It's a really cool important--

01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:33.872
[PHONE RINGING]

01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.590
--result. Tell them
you'll call them back

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:40.730
unless it's about the band
structure of silicon, whoever's

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.580
phone that was.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.790
Now, somebody tell
me what would happen

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:50.400
if I spaced my molecules--

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.030
this is a silicon solid.

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:54.280
Now, what would happen--

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.290
oh, let me, in the last
few minutes of class--

01:11:57.290 --> 01:12:00.020
uh-oh, what's it doing?

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.710
Yeah, that doesn't
look good, does it?

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.150
Somebody tell me
what would happen

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:09.130
if I spaced my
atoms in the crystal

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:10.230
further and further apart.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.700
What's going to happen
to that band structure

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.322
if I make them go further
and further apart?

01:12:19.322 --> 01:12:20.940
AUDIENCE: You'll smooth it out.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:21.380
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What is that?

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.950
AUDIENCE: You'll smooth
it out [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:23.820
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
You'll smooth it out.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.440
What will happen eventually?

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.740
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, exactly.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:34.050
So I can plot the band
structure of an atom.

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.700
And what would I get?

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.380
My variation in
case based will be?

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.660
What would the band
structure-- what

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.880
would the variation in
k-space for an atom be,

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.200
just an isolated atom?

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.195
AUDIENCE: Zero.

01:12:48.195 --> 01:12:49.570
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Zero variation,

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:51.820
exactly, everything's flat.

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.682
You're the same
everywhere in k-space.

01:12:53.682 --> 01:12:56.140
You're just back to the picture
that we've been working in.

01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.920
So let's just see.

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:07.180
Now, you'll use this to
do molecule calculations

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.150
for your next homework.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.070
But we'll do some calculations.

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.670
I just want to show
one last point.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.420
And we'll do some
calculations also next week.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.580
Oh, it's loading.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.610
The nanoHUB toolkit is loading.

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:29.990
How do I-- do you think--

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.490
tell me, while this is loading--

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.900
if it ever finishes--

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:38.960
tell me what you think is going
to be an additional convergence

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.280
parameter for solids.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.270
Think about this picture.

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:50.610
It looks like that
may never load.

01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:57.610
Think about this picture here
and tell me what you think

01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:59.440
is going to be an
important convergence

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.700
parameter for solids.

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.466
Yeah?

01:14:01.466 --> 01:14:03.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:06.180
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
it's exactly right.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.280
I mean, because
now, how am I going

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.730
to know if the
variation is correct?

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:13.860
This variation I'm
telling you is extremely

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.360
important for crystals.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.198
This is what goes
to a band structure.

01:14:17.198 --> 01:14:18.990
This is what gives you
your band structure.

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:20.220
Is it right?

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:23.700
Well, did you do enough
of these energy level

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.630
calculations at enough
points in k-space?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:32.400
The code will now have
that as an input, you see.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.680
Ah-ha, there it is, beautiful.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:44.280
I think this is a bust here.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.150
Ah, oh, this is exciting.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:53.240
This reminds me of the
days of dial-up modem.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.272
I just read about them.

01:14:54.272 --> 01:14:55.730
I don't know about
them, of course.

01:14:58.290 --> 01:14:58.970
So here you go.

01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.590
This is SIESTA.

01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:05.390
It's not letting me scroll
down again, beautiful--

01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:07.190
run JML viewer, solid.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.320
It's not responding.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.980
That's also interesting.

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.390
Oh, there's the scrollbar.

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:20.210
Can I run it?

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:24.145
It's really not-- yeah,
I can't even click this.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.300
Ah-ha, oh, yeah--

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.158
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Right.

01:15:28.158 --> 01:15:29.950
That's the first time
that's ever happened.

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:31.450
AUDIENCE: I got that last night.

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:32.590
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:36.280
Well, so anyway,
that would have been

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.600
a band structure of silicon.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.370
But what you can see
here, look at this.

01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:40.840
Oh, but look under here.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.610
You see, don't pay
attention to that.

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:46.110
Look at this, k-point density.

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:51.490
That is a new convergence
parameter for solids.

01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.520
Can I get a wiggly band
structure for silicon

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.500
with just one k-point
in my simulation?

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.430
You can, actually.

01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:58.810
And I'll tell you why.

01:15:58.810 --> 01:15:59.630
Will it be right?

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:01.850
No.

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:04.450
And I'm going to
pick up on that point

01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:07.480
to make sure we understand
this convergence parameter

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.780
when we start next week.

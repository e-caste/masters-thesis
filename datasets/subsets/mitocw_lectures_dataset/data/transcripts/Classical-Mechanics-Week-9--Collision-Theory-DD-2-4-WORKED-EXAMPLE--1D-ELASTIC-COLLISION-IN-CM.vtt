00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.640
Let's consider a
collision in a lab frame

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.620
in which one
particle is coming in

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.960
and the other
particle is at rest.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.710
So here's particle 2.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.890
V2 initial is 0.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.210
And we could say
that m2 is twice m1.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.850
And this is our lab frame.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.700
And now let's consider
the same collision

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.580
in the center of mass frame.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.590
And in that reference
frame, we have

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:43.150
particle 1 moving with
velocity V1 prime initial

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.260
and particle 2 moving with
velocity V2 initial prime.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.990
Now, the way we're going
to analyze this problem

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.740
is that we know the speeds
in the center of mass frame

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.870
relative to the lab frame.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.340
So we actually know
these initial speeds.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.039
And we'll write that
result down in a moment.

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.570
Because we know
the initial speeds,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.289
we also know that V1 final
in the center of mass frame

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:23.234
is just minus the
initial velocity.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:25.150
That's the beauty of the
center of mass frame.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.800
The velocities just
change direction.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.330
They don't change magnitude.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.350
Because we know this
we can get V1 final.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.630
And then it's just
a simple exercise

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.430
to go back to the lab
frame to calculate

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.080
the quantity, the velocity of
the object 1 in the lab frame.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.390
So that will be our
sequence of ideas.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:55.150
And the key fact that
we know is that V1 prime

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.480
is equal initially to
the reduced mass divided

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:13.530
by m1 times V1, 2,
where V1, 2 initial

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.390
is just equal to
V1 initial minus 0.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.579
So that's V1 initial.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:32.370
And the ratio, mu over m1, it's
very simple to calculate that.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.690
That's just m2 over m1 plus
m2, or our case, that's 2/3.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.430
And so from our result,
we now have very simply

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.880
that V1 final prime is
minus V1 initial prime.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.000
So it's minus 2/3 V1 initial.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.780
And that's a very
straightforward calculation.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.350
We can do exactly the same
thing with V2 final prime.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:21.180
V2 final prime is
minus V2 initial prime.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:33.120
And V2 initial prime is equal
to minus mu over m2 times V1, 2

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.460
initial.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.710
This ratio instead of being
2/3, it's a simple exercise.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:45.390
It will be m1 over m1
plus m2 is 1/3 V1 initial.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:53.280
And so we have solved for the
final velocities in the center

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.990
of mass reference frame.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.060
Now let's just double
check our results.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.570
We have V2 final is
minus V2 initial.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.400
So that's minus.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.340
But there's another
minus sign here.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.020
So we have 2 minus signs.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.430
So that's a plus.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.960
And that's why we have
a plus 1/3 V1 initial.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.660
And finally, if we want
to ask the question, what

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.329
are the velocities
in the lab frame,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.370
it's now a very simple exercise
to do reference frame change.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
We do need to know what
V center of mass is.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.250
That's V1 V initial over m1
plus m2, because remember

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.280
that V2 initial is 0.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.470
So that's another
factor, V1 initial.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.280
And now for conclusion, we
have that the final velocity

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.370
in the lab frame is
equal to the velocity

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.060
in the center of mass frame
plus V center of mass.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.800
And we just collect our
results, minus 2/3 V1

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.000
initial plus 1/3 V1 initial.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.630
So that's minus 1/3 V1 initial.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.890
The outgoing velocity of
particle 1 in the lab frame

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.660
and the outgoing velocity of
particle 2 in the lab frame,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:26.370
again, we have 1/3 V1 initial
plus another 1/3 V1 initial

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.080
is equal to 2/3 V1 initial.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.130
So we were able to solve this
problem by switching reference

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.440
frame using our basic fact
in the center of mass frame

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.700
that the speeds remain the
same but the direction changes

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.940
and able to solve this
problem without any

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.650
of the traditional ways of
applying the energy momentum

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.132
relationship and kinetic energy
or having quadratic equations.

[SQUEAKING]

[RUSTLING]

00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:06.762
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920
SCOTT HUGHES: All right.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.070
So welcome back.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.510
I had a little bit of a break.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.010
Before I get into--

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.357
I go over my quick
recap, you hopefully all

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:19.940
have seen the
announcements that we're

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.090
going to delay the due date
of the next problem set

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.710
until Tuesday.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.812
That's in part because some of
the material that appears on it

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:30.020
is what we're going to talk
about in today's lecture.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.710
So I want to make sure you've
at least seen a lecture on all

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.470
the topics before you try to
do some of the problems on it.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.648
In truth, you could probably--

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:41.940
based on things I talked
about in the previous lecture,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.232
you could probably deduce a
lot of what you need to do,

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:47.180
but still, it's good to go
over it a little bit more

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.420
methodically.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.628
And I'm trying to think.

00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:53.170
Is there anything
else I want to say?

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.670
Yeah.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.040
So then the next problem set
will be posted a week from--

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.010
is that right?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.542
Yeah, I think we post
a week from today.

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:02.000
So let me just get
back to what you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.208
were talking about last time.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.980
So I began introducing
some geometric concepts

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.310
and some quantities that
we use to describe matter.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.870
We've done a lot
of things so far

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.245
that's appropriate
for describing

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.320
kind of the kinematics
of particles,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.790
but that's rather restrictive.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.550
We want to talk about a broader
class of things than that.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.800
And I began by introducing
something which is, again,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.190
fairly simple, but
it's a useful tool

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.520
for beginning to think
about how we are going

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.910
to mathematically categorize
certain important types

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.740
of matter.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.573
Pardon me while I put
some of my notes away.

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:36.280
Also, pardon me.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.238
I'm recovering from a--

00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:39.400
I caught a terrible cold
over the long weekend,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.810
and I'm coughing incessantly.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.432
So I will be occasionally
sucking on a cough drop.

00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:47.890
So I introduced the quantity
called the number four-vector.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.980
And that is given by-- imagine
you have sort of a-- it's best

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.397
to think about this in the
context of something like dust.

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:56.170
So you have some kind of
non-interacting little

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.620
agglomeration of tiny particles.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.890
And in the rest frame of
an element of this dust--

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.440
so imagine you go
into-- well, I'm

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.710
going to define the rest
frame of that element

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.877
by saying imagine you've
got a cubic nanometer of it

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:08.860
or something like that.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.610
And you go into the
frame where everything

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.690
in that cubic nanometer
is on average at rest.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.660
We'll call n sub 0
the rest density.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.070
So I forgot to write that down.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.240
So that's the rest density.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.560
The rest-- pardon me--

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.880
number density.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.690
So I go into that rest frame.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.360
That tells me how many
little dust particles there

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.510
are per cubic volume,
per element of volume.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.480
Multiply that by the
four-vector that--

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.260
excuse me-- the four-velocity
describing that element.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.302
And we're going to call
that capital N. So that's

00:02:51.302 --> 00:02:52.740
a vector that describes--

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.260
its components describe
the number density

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.640
in some other
frame of reference,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440
in any frame of reference.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.960
And the flux, talking about
how those dust particles

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.153
flow from one
element to another.

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:05.820
So we spent a little
bit of time talking

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.830
about how to define
volume elements

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.970
in a covariant fashion.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.345
I'm not going to
go through that,

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:12.240
but part of the
punchline of doing that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.200
is that we're going to
define a sort of what

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.360
I call a covariant formulation
of conservation of number.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.290
It's going to be the
spacetime divergence

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.460
of that vector is equal to 0.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.040
That holds-- this equation holds
in all frames of reference.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.540
If I choose a particular frame
of reference, in other words,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.330
I define a particular time,
I define a particular set

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.100
of spatial
coordinates, I can then

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.260
break this up and
say that this is

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.470
equivalent to saying that
the time derivative of the t

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.460
component of that plus
the spatial divergence,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.640
the spatial confluence
is that they sum to 0.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.360
I can also take this thing
and integrate over a--

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.600
oops-- it would help to have
one element defined here.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.800
I integrate this over a
four-dimensional volume.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.870
And by my conservation law,
I must get 0 when I do that.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.710
Again, having chosen a
particular frame, defined what

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.290
time means, defined
what space means,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.740
I can then split this
out into a statement

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:25.090
that the time derivative of
the volume integral of the time

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.520
component of this
thing is balanced

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.270
by the flux of the number
across the boundaries

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.280
of a particular three-volume.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.740
I remind you this notation,
this sort of delta V3

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.930
means the boundaries
of the V3 that's

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.960
used under this integral.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.437
So we talked a little bit
about a few other four-vectors

00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:44.020
that are used.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.030
In particular I
introduced some stuff

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.920
that we use in
electricity and magnetism.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.870
But I want to switch gears.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.750
In particular, I want
to introduce and discuss

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.040
in some detail one of the
most important tensors

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.040
we are going to use all term.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.282
So I motivated this by saying
imagine I have a cloud of dust.

00:05:04.282 --> 00:05:05.740
And I won't recreate
one, because I

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.190
am getting over a cold.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.850
And I don't want to
breathe chalk dust.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.440
So I imagine I make a little
cloud of these things here.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.020
So far we've
characterized this thing

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.730
by just counting the
number of dust particles

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.360
that are in there.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.068
But that's not all
there is to it, right?

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.993
That dust has other properties.

00:05:19.993 --> 00:05:21.910
And so the next thing
which I would like to do

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.000
is let's consider the energy and
the momentum of every particle

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.120
of dust in that cloud.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.630
So let's just
imagine, again, we're

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.870
going to start with
something simple,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.578
and then we'll kind
of walk up from there

00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:43.850
to a more generic situation.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.980
Let's imagine that
my cloud consists

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.010
of particles that
are all identical,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.270
and each dust particle
has the same rest mass.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.680
So suppose this guy
has a rest mass m.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.520
So one of the things
that I might want to do

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.958
is in addition to characterizing
this dust by saying

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.000
that the number density--

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.488
[COUGHING] excuse me--

00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:22.030
in addition to saying
that the number

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.890
density in a particular
frame is n or n0,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.990
let's go into the rest
frame of this thing.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.020
I might be interested in knowing
about the rest energy density.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.340
So I'm going to denote the rest
energy density by rho sub 0.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.165
Each particle has
a rest energy of m.

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:06.990
Remember, c is equal to 1.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.623
So mc squared, if you want
to hold to the formula

00:07:13.623 --> 00:07:15.790
that we've all known and
loved since we were babies.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.500
So that's the rest energy.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.410
And then how many-- if I want
to get the rest energy density,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.200
I count up the number
in each volume,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.620
or the number per unit volume.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.920
So that's m times n0.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.990
So that's the rest energy
density of this thing.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.400
Great.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.100
Let's now ask, OK, so that's
what it looks like in the rest

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.190
frame of this dust element.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.410
Let's imagine that I now
bop into a frame that

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.516
is moving with some speed
relative to this rest frame.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.202
In this frame, the
energy density--

00:08:05.202 --> 00:08:07.410
I'm not going to say rest
energy density, because I'm

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.940
no longer in the rest frame.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:18.800
But the energy
density in this frame,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.640
which I will denote by rho
without the subscript 0

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.260
is going to be the
energy of each particle.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.880
So that's gamma times m.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.539
And the volume is
going to be length--

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:34.690
it's going to be a
little bit larger.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.190
Sorry.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.480
The volume is smaller because
of a length contraction.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:46.060
And so this guy actually gets
boosted up to gamma and 0.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.020
So in this frame,
the energy density

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.355
is larger than the rest energy--

00:08:55.355 --> 00:08:59.170
excuse me-- the rest energy
density with a gamma squared

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.380
factor.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.380
Straightforward algebra.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.963
But I want you to stop and think
about what that's telling us.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.700
If this rho were a
component of a four-vector,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.790
is there any way I could get a
gamma squared out of this thing

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.900
by bopping between
reference frames?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.710
No, right?

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.280
When I do that, it's linear
in the Lorentz transformation

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.150
matrix.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.670
There's no way with a
linear transformation

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.420
that I would pick up
two powers of gamma.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.630
This is not how a-- you
guys are probably all

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.240
used to from Newtonian physics
of thinking of energy density

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.690
as a scalar.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.430
This is not a Lorentz scalar.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.002
A scalar is the same in
all frames of reference.

00:09:39.002 --> 00:09:40.335
So this is a different quantity.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.880
So it's neither a four-vector
component nor a scalar.

00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:08.050
It's got two of those
things, so it's not

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.490
going to surprise you
that what's actually

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.907
going on here is we are picking
out-- what we've done here

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:15.450
is we've picked out a particular
component of a tensor.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.200
Let's think a little
bit more methodically

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.300
about what tensor that must be.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.630
So when I originally wrote down
my rho 0 here, I sort of just

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.210
argued on physical
grounds that it

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.470
is the energy of every particle
times the number of particles

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.870
per unit volume of that thing.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.160
Well, the energy that I
use in this thing doing it

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.520
in both the rest frame and
in the other frame, those

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.640
are the time-like components
of a particular four-vector.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:11:02.150
So we assembled rho
by combining energy,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:20.590
which is the time-like
component of the four-momentum

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:33.270
with number density, which
is the time-like component

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.820
of the number vector that I
just recapped a few minutes ago.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.570
So those are two time-like
components of four-vectors

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.070
here.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:53.250
So that rho is something like--

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.610
well, let's put it this way.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:00.910
I can write this as
pt nt, which tells me

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.850
that it belongs to a tensor.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:09.020
So let's define this
as some tt of a tensor

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.290
that I've not carefully
introduced yet.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.000
There is some underlying
tensor that we

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.630
have built by looking at the--

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.085
there are various
names for this.

00:12:18.085 --> 00:12:21.744
We'll call it the tensor product
of two different four-vectors.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.140
So if I write this in the kind
of abstract tensor notation

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.020
that I've used occasionally--
in some of your textbooks this

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.720
would be written with
a bold faced capital T,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.460
I will use a double
over line for this.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:10.110
We might say that this t is the
tensor product of the number

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.900
vector with the four-momentum.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:20.070
Now, the number vector
is itself just n0 times

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.750
the four-velocity.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.050
And my momentum, since all
the particles, I'm assuming,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:31.200
are the same is just the rest
mass times the four-momentum.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.440
This thing actually looks kind
of like the four-velocity times

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.140
four-velocity with a
prefactor And that prefactor

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.480
is nothing more than
the rest density.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.980
So another way to
say this is that if I

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.690
make my cloud of
dust, and I go in

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.330
and I look at every
little element in it,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:59.090
I take the rest energy density
of every element in that dust.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.255
I construct the
tensor that comes

00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:03.380
from making the tensor
product of the four-velocity

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.550
of that dust with itself.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.570
That is what this geometric
object is equal to.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.940
If you want to write this
in index notation, which

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:19.360
is how we will write
it 99.8% of the time,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:27.850
we would say that component
alpha beta of this quantity t

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.720
is that rest density
times u alpha u beta.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.970
So this is-- in terms
of the physics we're

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.692
going to do this
term, this is perhaps

00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:44.150
the most important quantity
that we're going to talk about.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.358
So it's worth understanding
what this thing is really

00:14:46.358 --> 00:14:47.300
telling us.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.570
So if I wanted to get these
components, the alpha beta,

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.300
out of this thing from this
sort of abstract notation

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.510
of the tensor, I'll remind
you that we can do this

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:03.220
by taking the tensor and
plugging into its slots

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.320
the basis 1 forms, which
tell me something about--

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.120
basis 1 forms are
really useful for sort

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.490
of measuring fluxes across
in a particular direction.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.920
And in fact, this quantity has
the geometric interpretation--

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:32.760
think of this as the flux
of momentum component alpha

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.768
in the beta direction.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.413
So if we look at this
component by component,

00:15:42.413 --> 00:15:43.330
it's worth doing that.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.066
So let's do the tt
or 00 component.

00:15:50.807 --> 00:15:52.390
So this is the one
we've already done.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:58.200
This is just rho 0 ut ut.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.760
It's just rho in that thing.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.680
According to the words
I've written down here,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:14.020
this is the flux of
pt in the t direction.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.080
So pt tells me about energy.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.330
The flux of energy in the
energy direction refers to--

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.528
so here's my water flowing
in the time-like direction,

00:16:24.528 --> 00:16:26.695
just sitting there apparently
doing nothing, but no,

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.280
it's moving through time.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.120
This is energy
flowing through time.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:45.370
It's energy density, all sort of
locked up in stable equilibrium

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.330
here.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.385
But if somebody comes in someday
with a nice cup of anti-water

00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:51.760
and combines it, we get to
have all that energy released.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.460
And we can enjoy that
for a few femtoseconds

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.470
before we evaporate.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.037
Let's look at the
other components.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.910
So T0i, you can
take the definition

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.660
and plug it in in terms
of the components.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.450
It's obviously ut
times ui, but still use

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.240
the definition by words.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:37.810
So this is the flux of p
sub t in the xi direction.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.280
This is talking
about energy moving

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.921
in a particular direction.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.423
This is nothing more than
energy flux, energy sort of flux

00:17:50.423 --> 00:17:52.840
that we are used to think
about, not flowing through time,

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.923
but flowing through space.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:05.380
Now, T0i, this is the
flux of momentum component

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:13.520
i in the t direction.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.480
So this tells me about
momentum density.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.900
So if I had this
stuff flowing, there's

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.030
some momentum associated
with that flow.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.850
You can count up the amount of
mass and every little volume.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.130
Divide by that volume.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:26.980
Take some ratios.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.615
That is the density of momentum.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:56.530
And finally, this last one,
flux of p i in the xj direction,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.270
there's really no
great wisdom for that.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.040
This is nothing more
than momentum flux.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.780
If I have a bucket of water
and things are sort of sloshing

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.370
around, there's some
momentum moving,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.830
and the whole assembly is
moving in some direction,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.777
we can get a flow of
momentum going in kind

00:19:11.777 --> 00:19:12.860
of a non-normal direction.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.568
As long as it goes in
a normal direction,

00:19:14.568 --> 00:19:16.240
it might be moving
along its flow.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.115
I'm going to talk about
that in a few moments

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.830
when I talk about a few
different kinds of stress

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.735
energy tensors.

00:19:22.735 --> 00:19:24.610
The key thing which I
want you to be aware of

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.235
is that under the
hood of this thing,

00:19:26.235 --> 00:19:28.360
we're going to talk about
different kinds of stress

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.880
energy tensors for a
little later in this class.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.843
But this basic
interpretation of the way

00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:34.510
to think about the
different components,

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.913
it holds for all of them.

00:19:35.913 --> 00:19:37.330
So this is good
intuition to have.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:57.403
One thing which
is worth noting is

00:19:57.403 --> 00:19:58.820
if you look at--
if you actually--

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.778
let's take the form of
the stress energy tensor

00:20:00.778 --> 00:20:02.873
that corresponds to the dust.

00:20:02.873 --> 00:20:05.040
So I'm going to write out
all four of my components.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.165
I've already given you T00.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:18.810
T0i, I can write that as
gamma squared rho 0 vi T0i

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.340
equals gamma squared rho 0 vi.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.147
This guy is gamma
squared rho 0 vi vj.

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:33.730
There's two elements
of symmetry here,

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.330
which I want to emphasize.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:41.210
Notice energy density
and momentum flux.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.560
Sorry.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.010
Energy flux and momentum
density, those words

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.730
are important.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.540
Energy flux and
momentum density,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.290
they're exactly the same.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.620
That is actually
true in all physics.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.658
It's clouded by the fact,
though, that in most units

00:20:57.658 --> 00:21:00.200
that we measure things, we don't
typically use speed of light

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.370
equal to 1.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.970
So when you look at these kind
of quantities in the physics

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:10.875
that you are more used to,
you would find your energy,

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:12.500
your energy flux,
your momentum density

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.210
will have different
units, because you'll

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.002
have factors of c that
come into there that

00:21:16.002 --> 00:21:19.510
convert from 1 momentum,
and energy, and time flow,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.200
and space flow.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.200
Also, you don't usually include
rest mass and rest energy

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.290
in the energy flows
and momentum densities

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.330
that you've probably been
familiar with in the past.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.905
So it's when we do
relativity, and we

00:21:35.905 --> 00:21:37.280
set the speed of
light equal to 1

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.820
that this symmetry between
energy flux and momentum

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.980
density becomes apparent.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.480
Question.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.294
AUDIENCE: The second one, do
you mean rho 1 will be there?

00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:49.800
SCOTT HUGHES: Sorry.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.330
This one?

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.008
AUDIENCE: Yeah, on
the right-hand side.

00:21:52.008 --> 00:21:53.550
SCOTT HUGHES: On
the right-hand side.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.360
This is--

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.680
AUDIENCE: Rho i.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.368
SCOTT HUGHES: No,
this is definitely

00:21:57.368 --> 00:21:58.660
what I mean to write down here.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.700
So this is-- what I've
done, I've taken advantage

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.230
of the fact that I can write--

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.730
let's see.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.897
Do I have it down somewhere?

00:22:07.897 --> 00:22:08.470
Yeah.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.970
Yeah.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.610
So what I've done
over here is I have

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:18.150
written the fact-- so u sub t,
ut is just the gamma factor.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.280
And I didn't explicitly
write out what t--

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.730
the i components, but you get
a similar factor that way.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.775
So no, that is correct that way.

00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:28.150
AUDIENCE: So that's why you
mean the first and the second

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:28.570
are the same.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.050
SCOTT HUGHES: Yeah.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.550
Yeah.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.850
And I just want to emphasize--

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.340
I mean, the key thing
which I want to emphasize

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.950
is when you do it in the physics
that you guys have generally

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.270
all seen up till now,
it won't look that way.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.580
And there's two causes of that.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.830
One is you're not used to
necessarily working in units

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.110
where the speed of light is 1.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.850
And two, rest energy is
built into these definitions.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.442
That shifts things a little bit.

00:22:46.442 --> 00:22:48.150
The other thing which
I want to emphasize

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.290
is notice this is symmetric
under exchange of indices.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.610
Now, it's obvious for dust.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.080
It comes right back to
the fact that these guys--

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.610
that those indices
enter like so.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.780
It's an exterior product of
the four-velocity with itself.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.830
I'm not going to go
through in detail,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.920
but there is a
physical motivation

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.870
that I will sketch
in a few moments that

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.210
argues that it must
be symmetric like this

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.570
in all physical cases.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.290
I have a detailed
sketch of this.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.960
I keep using the word sketch,
because my mind wants to say

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.700
proof, but it ain't a proof.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.220
It's sort of a motivation.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.490
And so I will post it for
everyone to go through,

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.220
but I will sort of illuminate
it in a couple of moments.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.470
Basically, if this is
not true, if it's not

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.810
the case this is symmetric,
a physical absurdity

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.740
can be set up.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.240
I'll describe that
in a few moments.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:49.330
So most of the
world is not dust.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.690
So this is a decent example for
helping to understand things.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.763
But we are going
to want to do more

00:23:54.763 --> 00:23:56.305
complicated and
interesting examples.

00:24:14.404 --> 00:24:14.983
Pardon me.

00:24:14.983 --> 00:24:15.650
Just one second.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.990
Let me just check
here with this page.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.910
Yeah.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.990
So for us, the way that
we are going to do this,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.990
there is a fairly
general recipe that one

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.620
can imagine applying to this.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.828
I'm going to save it for a
little later in the class.

00:24:31.828 --> 00:24:34.320
It sort of borrows some
techniques from field theory.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.840
Basically, if you can write
down a Lagrangian density that

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.990
describes the fifth system
that you're under study,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.390
there's a particular
variation you can do,

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.850
that stress energy
tensor emerges from.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.190
But for now, the key
thing which I want to say

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:53.780
is that we basically are going
to deduce what the stress

00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:03.360
energy tensor looks
like by essentially

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.128
going into a particular frame--
we'll call it the rest frame.

00:25:06.128 --> 00:25:07.920
It's usually the rest
frame of some element

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.050
of the material being studied--

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.200
and thinking carefully about
this physical definition

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.850
of what the different
components mean.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.743
This is not the most
rigorous way to do it,

00:25:16.743 --> 00:25:18.660
but it's a good way to
get started and develop

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.813
some intuition.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:53.370
So let me give one example
that for many of us

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.880
in astrophysics, this is
probably the one stress energy

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.095
tensor that we write
down and use over,

00:25:59.095 --> 00:26:00.720
and over, and over
again in our career.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.760
And it's rare we
do anything more

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.365
than this in many, many cases.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.730
This is called a perfect fluid.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.230
So what is perfect
about a perfect fluid?

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.810
It begs the question here.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.420
What is perfect
referring to here?

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.900
So a perfect fluid
is a fluid in which

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:32.140
there is no energy flow in what
I will call the "rest" frame.

00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:37.850
I put rest in
quotes, because you

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.340
have to sort of define it
from the context of what

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.240
your fluid is here.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.615
Basically, what
it means is I can

00:26:42.615 --> 00:26:45.440
find a frame in which
each fluid element there

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.760
is no energy flow there.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.430
If a frame exists
where that happens,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.730
there's a candidate
to be a perfect fluid.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.980
And I also require there
to be no lateral stresses.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:06.070
Lateral stresses
refer to this Tij

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.960
when i and j are not
equal to one another.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.290
So this sort of
refers to-- imagine

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:15.040
that I have some-- let's
say going into the board

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.700
is the y direction.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.420
So if there's like some
y stress that is somehow

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.340
being transported
in the x direction,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.123
that would be a lateral stress.

00:27:24.123 --> 00:27:26.290
Physically, this is actually--
that kind of a stress

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.340
is hugely important when
one is studying fluids.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.110
And one characterizes
it by a quantity

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.960
known as the viscosity.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.990
Viscosity tells me about how
stress gets transported--

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.000
how momentum, rather,
gets transported

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.585
in a non-normal direction,
against the direction

00:27:43.585 --> 00:27:47.040
in which the fluid is moving.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.600
So my perfect fluid
has no viscosity.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.560
And I'll just conclude.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.290
I want to make-- there's a
very important point here.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.040
A fluid that has no
viscosity is a fluid

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.830
that doesn't get anything wet.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.170
So this refers to when you
pour water on yourself,

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.045
the reason your hand
gets wet is that there's

00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:09.940
some viscosity that actually
prevents it-- causes there

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.700
to be sort of a shearing
force, which causes the water

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.030
to stick to your skin.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.980
So a perfect fluid,
this has been described

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.520
as the physics of dry water.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.687
So it is-- anyone who's
in applied math will know.

00:28:23.687 --> 00:28:25.770
They'll sort of roll their
eyes and say, OK, fine,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:30.330
we'll do this sort of infant
version of fluid first.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.730
And then a lot of the
action and a lot of the fun

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.990
comes from putting in viscosity
and doing the real fluids.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.600
For the purposes of our class,
what this boils down to is

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.230
this tells me that the
physics of this quantity

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:51.790
is totally dominated
by the fluid's energy

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.240
density and its pressure.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.230
The pressure is an
isotropic spatial stress.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:20.630
So in this particular frame,
where I have no energy being

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:42.110
transported, then the
stress energy tensor can be

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.910
represented as energy density
as usual up in the-- whoops,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:47.720
over there now--

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.100
up in the tt component.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.540
There is no energy flux.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.400
By symmetry, if
there's no energy flux,

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.540
there is no momentum of density.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.840
And my spatial stresses
are totally isotropic,

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.115
and none of them are lateral.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:22.275
So it just looks like this,
the diagonal of rho p, p, p, p.

00:30:26.468 --> 00:30:28.010
As I said, this is
actually something

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.350
that we're going to use over,
and over, and over again.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.090
This is actually a--
so you can actually

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.210
consider my dust
stress energy tensor

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.580
to be a perfect fluid
with no pressure.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.000
So this actually
subsumes this other one.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.570
I will-- just
illustrative purposes,

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.290
I'll show an example of a
case that cannot be thought

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:48.450
of as a perfect fluid.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.530
But we will tend to use
this a lot in our class.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.900
And as I will demonstrate
in just a moment,

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.455
we're going to find
that this ends up

00:30:55.455 --> 00:30:57.080
playing an important
role in generating

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.130
gravitational fields.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.420
What's interesting
about this is you

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.837
guys are probably
used to the idea

00:31:00.837 --> 00:31:03.022
that mass generates
gravity, and then

00:31:03.022 --> 00:31:04.730
throw in a c square
that tells you energy

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.240
to generating gravity.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.740
But it's also-- we're going to
see pressure generates gravity.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.870
And it's connected to the
mathematical structure

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.520
of this guy here.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.608
So notice I've written
an equal dot here.

00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:19.400
So this is just the
way this is represented

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.800
in this particular frame.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:27.680
I would like to write this in a
more covariant form, something

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.070
that does not rely on me
going into a particular frame

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.218
of reference.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:46.370
So the trick which I'm
going to use for this

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.530
is when I think about
that form there--

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:53.570
so the rho piece of it, clearly,
what I'm doing there is I'm

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.250
picking out--

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.100
that is-- can be thought of--
as the energy density multiplied

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.090
by the tensor product of
the four-velocity that

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.370
describes a particular
element of this fluid.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.390
So I can write, again, using
this sort of abstract notation.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.630
This piece of it
looks like this.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.190
And so if I go into
the frame, if I

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.280
go into the rest frame of
the fluid, that's just my u

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.240
is 1 and 0.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.220
And the spatial
components, that builds

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.530
my upper left-hand
corner of this tensor.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.170
How do I get the rest of this?

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.270
Well, to get the rest of
it, these are all sort of

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.220
picked out of components
of the tensor that

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.230
are orthogonal to u.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.990
And I put an Easter
egg in p set 1.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.870
You guys developed
a tensor that allows

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.970
me to build-- it's a
geometric object that

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.150
allows me to describe things
that are orthogonal to a given

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.050
four-vector.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:56.520
So if I take the
projection tensor

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:05.470
that you guys built
one piece at 1,

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.210
which looks like the
metric plus the extern--

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.800
the tensor product of a
four-vector with itself,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.060
that gives me the p's that
go into that component.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:19.750
Or if I write this
in index notation,

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.750
I can do it in two ways.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.290
I will also emphasize
that there are

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.500
few moments in this class
where I sort of urge

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.380
you to take the sort of
long-term memory synapses

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.120
and switch them on.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.220
This is one of those moments.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.790
In a couple of
lectures, we're going

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.790
to introduce the principle
of equivalence, which

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.457
is the physical
principle by which we're

00:33:59.457 --> 00:34:01.785
going to argue how we go
from formulas that work

00:34:01.785 --> 00:34:03.160
in special relativity
to formulas

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.530
that work in general relativity.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.020
And by invoking the
principle of equivalence,

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.520
we're going to see
that when we want

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.040
to describe perfect fluids
in a general spacetime,

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.190
not just in special relativity
and general relativity,

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.929
it's exactly this formula.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.280
I just need to modify
what the metric means,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.030
but that will allow
me to carry that over.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.340
Let me see.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.330
So my notes are a little
bit disorganized here.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:31.909
There's a piece that I--

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:33.710
every year I want to
clean this bit up,

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.210
and every year at
this time of year,

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.520
I have 70 gajillion
administrative tasks.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.409
And I end up getting
behind schedule.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.422
So I will clean
this up on the fly.

00:34:42.422 --> 00:34:43.880
So there's a couple
of points which

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.530
I want to make about this.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.540
Let me do this point first.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.370
So by virtue of taking a
graduate physics class,

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.760
I'm confident you guys know
about Newtonian gravity.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:24.940
One can write the field
equation for Newtonian gravity

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.130
as essentially a
differential equation

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.040
for the potential that governs
Newtonian gravitational

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.890
interaction.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.240
So let's call phi sub g
the Newtonian gravitational

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.380
interaction.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.320
Whoops.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.240
And I can write a
field equation that's

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:47.770
governing it as essentially
its Poisson's equation.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.830
So the Laplace operator
acting on that potential

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:55.290
is up to a constant
equal to the--

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.697
we usually learn it in
terms of mass density.

00:35:57.697 --> 00:36:00.280
We're working in units where the
speed of light is equal to 1.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.670
So it could just as well
be the energy density.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.927
So you've all kind of seen that.

00:36:05.927 --> 00:36:07.510
Now, if we think
about how we're going

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.550
to carry this forward
and make gravity

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.640
a relativistic
interaction, this equation

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.440
should right away
make us suspicious,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.470
because we spent several
minutes earlier today

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:23.240
talking about the fact
that this is not a scalar.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.925
This is a component of a tensor.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.490
A physical theory
which tries to pick out

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.550
just one component
of a geometric tensor

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.700
is not a healthy theory.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.190
It would be like if
you had sort of learned

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.473
in E&M that there was
a preferred direction

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:50.390
of the electric field.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.730
If there's a particular set
of Maxwell's equations for Ex,

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.813
and a different set of
Maxwell's equations for Ey.

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:57.260
That would just be nonsense.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.980
Nature doesn't pick out spatial
components of any one being

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.850
particularly having some
weight over the others,

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.220
and the same thing holds in
relativity for spacetime.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.380
So when we make this into
a relativistic theory,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.200
we're going to say if
this component of a tensor

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.750
plays a large role in
gravity to make this

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.730
into a geometric object that
makes a large role in gravity,

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.060
I'm going to have to-- so
let's call this my Newtonian

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.280
equation.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.340
My Einsteinian equation--

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.170
I'm going to put an
equal sign in quotes

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.570
here, because there's a
lot of details to fill in.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.540
But what's going to go on
the right-hand side of this

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:39.230
has to be something that
involves the stress energy

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.970
tensor.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:44.450
Newton picks out one component
stress energy tensor.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.630
Relativity doesn't let me pick
out particular components.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.690
So whatever I get when
I do Einstein's gravity,

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.250
the whole stress
energy tensor is

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:57.315
going to be important in setting
the source of my gravity.

00:37:57.315 --> 00:37:58.940
That then sort of
says, well, then what

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.750
the heck do you do with
this left-hand side?

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.800
That is, in fact, going to be
starting probably on Tuesday

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.500
the subject of the next couple
of lectures, basically going

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.980
all the way up to spring break.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.630
The week before spring break
is when we complete the story

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.800
of what goes on the
right-hand side--

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800
excuse me-- the left-hand
side of this equation.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.740
But what I will tell
you is that it is indeed

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.500
going to involve two derivatives
of a potential-like object.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.260
And the potential-like
object is actually

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.693
going to turn out to be
the metric of spacetime.

00:38:31.693 --> 00:38:33.610
So that's kind of where
we're going with this.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.010
Let's do a little bit more
physics with the stress energy

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.510
tensor.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.300
So I have somewhat
more detailed notes,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.030
which I will post online, which
I am not going to go through

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.050
in great detail here.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.880
But I'm going to
kind of sketch this.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.522
So one is that I
would like to prove--

00:39:30.522 --> 00:39:32.730
again, that word is a little
bit of an overstatement,

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:36.360
but at least motivate the
symmetry of this tensor.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.730
I'm just going to focus on
the spatial bits of this.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.230
That'll be enough.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.272
Like I said, you can kind
of see that T0i and ti0 are

00:39:52.272 --> 00:39:54.480
the same thing by thinking
about the physical meaning

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.270
of four-momentum and what
a flux of four-momentum is.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.160
This one, there's kind of a
cute calculation you can do.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:10.665
So imagine you have some
little cube of stuff.

00:40:10.665 --> 00:40:15.270
It could be immersed in some
field or fluid, something

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:17.520
that is described by a
field of stress energy.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:47.210
And so to start out with,
let's look at how the flux--

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.520
remember what t alpha
beta, or really Tij

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.337
tells me about is
the flux of momentum

00:40:52.337 --> 00:40:53.420
in a particular direction.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.860
It's telling me about
the amount of momentum

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.360
going into this box on one side
and coming out on the other.

00:41:13.922 --> 00:41:15.630
So I'm going to look
at the momentum flux

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.140
into and out of this box.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.770
And so what I'm going to do
is let's look at the momentum

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.785
going into the sides that are--

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.830
so let's call this the
top and the bottom here.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.350
What I'm going to do
then is number the four

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.540
sides, the other four
sides of the box, not

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.200
the top and the bottom--

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.440
so let's call this side,
which is sort of facing away

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.230
from us here, that side one.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.570
The one that is facing
us that sort of points

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:52.380
out in the x direction,
I'll call that two.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.260
This side here, I
will call three.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.560
And the one that is on
the back I will call four.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.780
Apologies for the little
bit of a busy picture here.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.730
But just what you
want to do is sort

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.540
of imagine there's a
cube in front of you,

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.630
and you go around and
label the four sides.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.680
What we'd like to
do is calculate

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.810
what is the force
that is flowing

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.345
through each of these four
sides, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:42:29.345 --> 00:42:31.930
Just ignore the top and the
bottom for just a second.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.860
I'll describe why that
is in just a moment.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:45.175
So if I look at the force
on face one, well, face one,

00:42:45.175 --> 00:42:45.675
it is--

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.800
pardon me-- I
mislabeled my sides.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.160
I want to be synced
up with my notes,

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.590
and so I realize it's annoying.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.840
And I'm very sorry about that.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.030
But if I mess this
up, I will get out

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.860
of sync with what I
have written down.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.530
So the one that is
facing us is side one.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.900
Two is on the right-hand side.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.320
Three is the back.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.860
Four is on the left-hand side.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.230
My apologies for that.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.870
But I think it's important
we get that right so I don't

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.520
get out of sync with myself.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.740
So the total force
on face one is

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.940
what I get by basically adding
up all the flux of momentum

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.590
flowing through face one.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.990
So force on face one, that is--

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.110
the i-th component
of that is what

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:59.880
I get when I integrate
that over face one, which

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.110
is normal to the x-axis.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.990
Each side of the
cube is little l.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.880
So it's Tix l squared.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:23.540
Force on face two,
now this is the one

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.430
that is normal for the y-axis.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:34.440
And so this guy looks
like Tiy l squared.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.720
And you continue this F3--

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.000
if you look at, and
you if you assume

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:53.220
that this thing is small,
it's approximately the same

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.360
as the force on F1.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.850
It'll become equal in the
limit of the q becoming

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:57.870
infinitesimally small.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:08.220
And this is approximately the
same as the force on face two.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:14.820
So that tells us that
there's no unbalanced force

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.760
on this thing, which is great.

00:45:21.882 --> 00:45:24.760
Basically, it means that there's
no unbalanced force causing

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.750
this little element
to accelerate away.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:30.760
One of the reasons why I am
focusing on these four sides,

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.320
though, is I would also
like to consider torques

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.570
that are acting on this thing.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.273
And here's where I'm going to
skip over a couple of details

00:46:08.273 --> 00:46:09.690
and just leave a
few notes for you

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.180
guys to look at, because
we're a little short on time

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:11.930
with other things.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.250
This calculation is
straightforward, but it gets--

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.780
I already screwed
up a detail here.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.760
I don't want to sort of risk
messing up a few other things.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.060
What I want to do is
consider the torques

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.940
about an axis that sort
of runs through the middle

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.450
of this thing that goes from
the top and the bottom of this.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:30.660
So go through and just
add up all the torques

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.450
associated with these
little forces about an axis

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.050
in the center of--

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:37.800
that goes through the
center of this cube.

00:47:04.913 --> 00:47:06.330
So I'm going to--
like I said, I'm

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.180
going to leave out the details,
but basically, you go through,

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.487
and you do the usual
r cross f to get

00:47:11.487 --> 00:47:13.320
the forces, the torques
associated with each

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.362
of these different faces.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.390
And what you'll find
when you do this

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:34.710
is that there is a net
torque that looks like l

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:43.030
cubed times Txy minus Tyx.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.373
Again, though, this scales
with the size of the cube.

00:47:45.373 --> 00:47:47.540
So you look at this and
kind of go, well, who cares?

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.010
It's a little bit there.

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.302
Maybe it spins up a little bit.

00:47:49.302 --> 00:47:51.580
But in the limit,
the thing going to 0,

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.550
there's no net effect.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.250
Well, let's be a little
bit careful about this.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.710
What is the moment of
inertia of this cube?

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.350
I don't know exactly,
but I know that it's

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.200
going to be something like
the mass of this cube.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.450
We'll call that l cubed times
its mass density, or its energy

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.730
density.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.790
And it's going to involve two
powers of the only length scale

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:28.990
characterizing this thing.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.423
And there will be
some prefactor alpha.

00:48:33.423 --> 00:48:35.090
There will be some
number that's related

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.065
to the geometry of this.

00:48:37.065 --> 00:48:38.690
An integral or two
will easily work out

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.570
what the alpha is and
make this more precise.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.040
But the key bit which
I want to emphasize

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.900
is that this is
something that scales

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.430
as the size of the fifth power.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.010
So yeah, the torque
vanishes as l goes to 0,

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.740
but it does so with
the cubed power.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:11.360
It doesn't vanish as quickly as
the moment of inertia vanishes.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.420
And I'll remind you,
the angular acceleration

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:28.140
of the cube, theta double
dot, is the torque divided

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.950
by the moment of inertia.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.650
So this is something that
is proportional to Txy

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.820
minus Tyx divided by l squared.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.990
So yeah, the torque does
vanish as l goes to 0,

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.490
but the moment of
inertia vanishes

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:50.340
more rapidly as l goes to 0.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:56.450
That sort of suggests that
if we're in a screw universe,

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:58.160
little microscopic
vortices are just

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.370
going to start randomly
oscillating in any cup of water

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.850
that you pour in front of you.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:08.260
Now, I don't have a proof
that nature abhors that,

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.590
but it seems pretty screwy.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.460
And so the case that most
textbooks make at this point

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:23.600
is to say, physics
indicates we must

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:31.580
have Txy strictly equal
to Tyx in all cases,

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.660
independent of what the
size of this thing is.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:37.250
That had better just be a
bloody 0 in the numerator

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.290
in order to prevent
this physical absurdity

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:40.130
from being set up.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.830
Repeat the exercise
by looking at torques

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.540
around the other axes.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:51:04.720
And that drives you
to the statement

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.610
that this thing
must, in general,

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:07.798
be spatially symmetric.

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.340
And again, physics of the way
that energy and momentum behave

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.840
in relativity makes our sort of
timespace component symmetric

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.950
as well.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:16.600
I emphasize this is not a proof.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.370
This is really just a
physical motivation.

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.640
This is the kind of thing that
I'm a bloody astrophysicist.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.320
I like this kind of stuff.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.303
There is a different way of
developing the stress energy

00:51:26.303 --> 00:51:28.720
tensor, as I said, that comes
from a variational principle

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.360
sort of based on
sort of quantum field

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.920
theoretic type of methods.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.530
And the symmetry in
that case is manifest.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.360
It really does sort of come up.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.480
But this is a good way of just
motivating the fact that you're

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.120
not going to have
any non-diagonal--

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.940
or excuse-- non-symmetric
stress energy tensors.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.090
If you did, you would have
really bizarre matter.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.920
Now, the stress
energy tensor has

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.340
this physical interpretation
that it tells me

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:04.360
about the flow of energy and the
flow of momentum in spacetime.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.690
As such, it is the
tool by which we

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:13.440
are going to put conservation
of energy and conservation

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.420
of momentum into our theory.

00:52:32.043 --> 00:52:33.460
And the way we're
going to do this

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:37.290
is with a remarkably
simple equation.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:41.562
The spacetime divergence
of t alpha beta--

00:52:41.562 --> 00:52:47.250
pardon me-- must equal 0.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.430
This is a covariant formulation
of both conservation of energy

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.423
and conservation of momentum.

00:52:55.423 --> 00:52:57.090
And if you want to
say, well, which one?

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.900
Is it energy or is it momentum?

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.900
You can't say that in general.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.760
I can only say that after I have
picked a particular reference

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.130
frame, because it's only
once I have defined time

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:10.620
and I've defined space
that I've actually

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.972
defined energy and momentum.

00:53:13.972 --> 00:53:15.930
Prior to choosing a
particular reference frame,

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.630
all I have is four-momentum.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.100
One observer's energy is
another observer's superposition

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.058
of energy and momentum.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.800
Once I have picked
a particular frame--

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:47.830
so once I have picked a
particular frame, then

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:55.960
if I evaluate d alpha
T alpha either 0 or t,

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.790
this is what
conservation of energy

00:53:57.790 --> 00:53:59.090
looks like in that frame.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.400
So in that frame, here is
conservation of energy.

00:54:24.368 --> 00:54:24.910
I can fit it.

00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:56.010
Hang on a second.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:56.560
No, no, no.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.810
I had it right the first time.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.520
Yeah.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.020
Sorry.

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.760
I was just trying
to make sure I got

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.968
my indices lined up properly.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.340
So apologies you can't quite
read the bottom one so well.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.118
The top one is
conservation of energy

00:55:18.118 --> 00:55:19.160
in that particular frame.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.350
The second one is
conservation of momentum

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:22.930
in that particular frame.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:25.670
And again, the key thing
which I want to emphasize

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:29.840
is the covariant statement
basically puts both of them

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.550
together into a single equation.

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.657
I can only sensibly
state conservation

00:55:33.657 --> 00:55:35.240
of energy and
conservation of momentum

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.150
according to some
particular observer.

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:39.710
Now, I can repeat
the game that I

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:42.140
had done before with
the number vector

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.900
and turned these conservation
laws into integral equations

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.510
as well.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:46.510
Let me do it for energy.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.843
So if I take that
integral equation

00:56:21.843 --> 00:56:24.010
and integrate over a
three-volume, or if you prefer,

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.230
I can take the original
covariant formulation

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.325
and integrate that
over a four-volume.

00:56:29.325 --> 00:56:30.700
With a little bit
of manipulation

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.242
akin to the way I
manipulated the conserv--

00:56:33.242 --> 00:56:35.200
the integrals associated
with the number vector

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:46.910
in the previous lecture,
you can write down

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.320
a law that looks like this.

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:57.630
And so this-- again,
what I've done here

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:01.180
is I've chosen a particular
set of timeline coordinates.

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.180
And the language that we
often use in relativity

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.740
is we basically say I'm going
to take a single slice of time.

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:11.670
And I would say that the
rate of change of energy--

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:13.380
so integrate energy
over a volume.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.600
It's the total
energy in that V3.

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.610
The rate of change
of that thing is

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:19.530
balanced by the amount
of energy flowing

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:23.970
into or out of through the
boundaries of that volume.

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:25.540
Add an extra index here.

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:29.160
So make this-- make
one of these be a j.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.863
Make this guy be a j.

00:57:30.863 --> 00:57:32.280
And you've got a
similar statement

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.950
for the conservation
of momentum.

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.620
This is a particular trick.

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.455
I have a set of typed up
notes that just sort of clean

00:57:41.455 --> 00:57:42.330
this up a little bit.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:43.872
They're basically
exactly this point,

00:57:43.872 --> 00:57:47.160
but I'll put them online
after today's lecture.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.880
You're going to want to use this
on one of the p set problems

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.380
this week.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.880
So you guys are
going to do a couple

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.900
exercises that involve
integrating and actually

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:58.340
finding essentially moments
of the left-hand side

00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:58.923
of this thing.

00:57:58.923 --> 00:58:00.548
You're going to do
a few exercise where

00:58:00.548 --> 00:58:02.870
you take advantage of this
formulation of conservation

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:08.730
of energy and momentum to
derive a few identities involved

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:11.000
in the stress energy
tensor, one of which

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.880
is another Easter egg that
we're going to use quite a bit

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.610
in a future lecture.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:24.170
So let me just wrap up our
discussion of the stress energy

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:26.870
tensor by just doing
two more examples.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.430
And then I'm going
to sort of begin

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:29.638
switching gears a little bit.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:41.130
So far I have only described--

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.920
essentially, I've really only
described perfect fluids.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.370
Dust is a perfect
fluid with no pressure.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.670
There are a lot of other kinds
of materials that we want

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.200
to work with in the universe.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.170
One of which-- it's unlikely
many of you are going to use

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:05.220
this, but it's actually the
stress energy tensor on which I

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:06.115
have built--

00:59:06.115 --> 00:59:08.282
well, I guess Alex is going
to use it a little bit--

00:59:08.282 --> 00:59:11.250
I have built a big
chunk of my career.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:16.135
Suppose you have-- we kind of
talked a little bit about how

00:59:16.135 --> 00:59:17.760
the four-velocity
and the four-momentum

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.177
are really only good for talking
about like the kinematics

00:59:20.177 --> 00:59:20.727
of particles.

00:59:20.727 --> 00:59:22.560
Well, actually, particles
aren't a bad thing

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.030
to focus on in some
of your studies.

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:25.488
And much of my
research is actually

00:59:25.488 --> 00:59:30.630
based on the idea of thinking
about a binary system as one

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:33.120
member being a black
hole, and its companion

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.597
being a particle-like
object that

00:59:34.597 --> 00:59:36.930
is a particular limit of it,
a particle-like object that

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:38.550
orbits it.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:42.573
So a really simple
stress energy tensor--

00:59:42.573 --> 00:59:43.990
and I'm just
throwing it out here,

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:46.331
because I think it nicely
illustrates the principle.

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:53.220
A point particle with rest
mass, we'll call it m0.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.810
And I'm going to say it's moving
on a particular world line

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.051
through spacetime.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:11.570
So the way we
define a world line

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.550
is we just say it's
some four-vector that

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.670
describes the place of this
thing from some chosen origin.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:19.760
And it's generally most
convenient to parameterize it

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.090
by the proper time of
whatever object or creature is

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.300
moving on that world line.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.250
And so it's a lot like dust,
only there's no volume.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:34.050
It's sort of like
one particle of dust.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:36.290
And so the stress energy
tensor we use for this--

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.840
let me back up for
just a second here.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.330
When you guys learned about
electricity and magnetism,

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:53.930
one of the first things you
learn about are point charges.

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:55.472
And then a little
bit later you learn

01:00:55.472 --> 01:00:57.170
about charge distributions.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:58.475
And you have charge densities.

01:00:58.475 --> 01:01:00.350
And then, usually, at
some point in a class--

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:01.880
it's often like
junior level E&M--

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.570
we say, how do you describe
the density of a point charge?

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.930
That's where you learn about
the Dirac delta function.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.618
Well, if I have
a point particle,

01:01:09.618 --> 01:01:11.660
I'm going to need to
describe this thing's energy

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.700
density as essentially
a Dirac delta function.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:22.530
And so what we do is imagining
that these things-- so this is

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:23.970
the four-velocity of that body.

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.670
They might be functions of time
as this guy is moving along

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:27.990
here.

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:36.240
What we do is we introduce
a Dirac delta function

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.343
as this thing moves
along through spacetime.

01:01:38.343 --> 01:01:40.260
What this does-- you can
check the dimensions.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.952
This gives me exactly
what we need in order

01:01:42.952 --> 01:01:44.910
to have something that's
dimensionally correct,

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.952
and has all the symmetries
and all the properties

01:01:46.952 --> 01:01:51.000
that describe a particle moving
at a particular four-velocity

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.210
through spacetime.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.827
Now, you might
want to just-- it's

01:01:55.827 --> 01:01:58.160
the thing which I kind of
want to pause on for a second.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.260
You go, what the hell do
you do with this, right?

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.330
That's kind of inconvenient.

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:04.790
Well, the trick we use to sort
of clean up that Dirac delta

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:11.940
function, it's
very much like what

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.670
you do when you encounter
multidimensional delta

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:17.665
functions in basic physics.

01:02:17.665 --> 01:02:20.040
You just build it out of a
bunch of one-dimensional delta

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.039
functions.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.100
Likewise, you'll
have a term with a y

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.270
component and the z component.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:48.660
Then you use the rule
that if I integrate

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:55.550
a function of x against a delta
function whose argument is

01:02:55.550 --> 01:03:02.490
itself a function
of x, I evaluate

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.980
that function at the 0's of g.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.590
So let's say x0 is
where g has a 0.

01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:21.198
Normalizing to the
first derivative of g

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:22.800
evaluated at that 0.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:38.480
When you put all
of that together,

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:45.420
that basically means you can do
this somewhat abstract integral

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.440
formally.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.210
I mean, exactly.

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.700
You can just do it analytically.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.240
And what you do is you choose
one of the delta functions

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.440
to apply it to.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.252
Traditionally, people apply
it to the timeline component.

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:07.540
And what is the derivative
of the world line

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:12.050
z component with
respect to proper time?

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.820
It's the 0 component
of the four-velocity.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.895
So you just divide by the 0
component of the four-velocity,

01:04:18.895 --> 01:04:21.020
and then you're left with
a three-dimensional delta

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:26.120
function for the spatial
trajectory of this thing

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.430
through all space.

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:31.158
So this is an example
of one that just,

01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:33.200
again, kind of the intuition
is one of the things

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.033
I want to emphasize.

01:04:34.033 --> 01:04:35.690
Notice we had-- this
has the symmetries

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:37.160
that we wanted to have.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.760
It's not hard to show that this.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.830
You can think of
this as essentially

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.180
being kind like a gamma factor.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.680
This all ends up
giving me just what

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.972
we need for this thing to
have the right transformation

01:04:44.972 --> 01:04:48.060
properties.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.360
And it does, in fact,
play a role in some--

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.310
well, I'll say in some
research that's near

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.047
and dear to my heart.

01:04:55.047 --> 01:04:56.130
Let me do another example.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.770
Suppose you want to know the
stress energy tensor associated

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.800
with a given electric
and magnetic field.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.420
Well, first, let me just quote
for you the exact answer, which

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.830
is most compactly written if
we use that Faraday tensor

01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:28.230
F, which describes
electromagnetic fields

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:31.327
in a frame-independent fashion,
the way that I introduced it

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:32.160
in the last lecture.

01:05:35.550 --> 01:05:37.250
So in units where
basically everything

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:44.030
but pi is set equal to 1, it
ends up turning into this.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.520
So that's a bit of a mouthful.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.730
Let's go in and look at
particular components of it,

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.270
though.

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.550
So let's say I go into
a particular frame.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.760
I fill in my Faraday
tensor with the form

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.093
of electromagnetic field
that I introduced last time.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.510
And I'll just go
through, and I'll

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.677
evaluate all the different
components of this thing.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:40.770
So what you find when you fill
this in is your T00 component,

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:44.700
1 over 8 pi e squared
plus b squared.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.660
That's good.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.150
Hopefully, y'all
remember from basic E&M,

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:52.020
the energy density of an
E-field is e squared over 8 pi

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.537
and the right system of units.

01:06:53.537 --> 01:06:55.620
Energy density of a b field
is b squared over 8 pi

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.570
if you work in God's units.

01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:01.511
Let's do the
timespace component.

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:08.860
So again, hack through
that mess there.

01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.135
This is going to be
something that is a vector.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.910
In fact, it's the
Poynting vector.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.500
Could it be anything else?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.850
If you use the recipe
that I sort of suggested

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:29.350
as the easiest way
to approach this,

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:31.142
this is kind of what
you would have guessed

01:07:31.142 --> 01:07:32.430
for something like that.

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:35.220
The bit that's
actually kind of hard

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.550
is then trying to get the
spatial stresses of this thing.

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:47.260
And here I don't have
any great intuition

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.330
for this one to convey to you.

01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:52.090
It's derived in textbooks
like Griffiths and Jackson.

01:07:52.090 --> 01:08:02.910
So I'll just quote
for you the result.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:15.380
So you get one term that looks
like E squared plus b squared

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.960
on the diagonals.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:30.787
Then there's a correction,
which looks like this.

01:08:30.787 --> 01:08:32.579
I want to just quickly
call out one example

01:08:32.579 --> 01:08:35.060
so you can see what the
significance of this example

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.090
is.

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:42.478
So suppose you have something
like a pair of capacitors.

01:08:42.478 --> 01:08:44.770
And there's just a uniform
electric field between them.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.353
You want to evaluate
the stress energy

01:08:46.353 --> 01:08:50.529
tensor between those
pairs of capacitors.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:52.810
So my spatial electric
field, let's say it just

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:55.180
points in the Ex direction.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:55.930
And it's constant.

01:09:13.245 --> 01:09:14.870
So when you actually
evaluate this guy,

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:15.997
there's no energy flow.

01:09:15.997 --> 01:09:17.080
There's no magnetic field.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.507
So there's no Poynting vector.

01:09:18.507 --> 01:09:20.840
You, of course, have E squared
over 8 pi for your energy

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.340
density.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.472
Very different from
a perfect fluid.

01:09:33.472 --> 01:09:34.680
And this kind of makes sense.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680
That's sort of
telling you that there

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.380
is a stress that
if you have a pair

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.649
of plain parallel capacitors,
you tend to attract

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:42.720
the plates to each other.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.736
But there is a
pressure associated

01:09:44.736 --> 01:09:46.319
with that electric
field that actually

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:47.978
goes in the other directions.

01:09:47.978 --> 01:09:49.020
This is your x direction.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.420
This is y and z.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.118
And as a consequence of this--

01:09:53.118 --> 01:09:54.660
so there's some
stuff which we're not

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.327
going to do too much
with in this class,

01:09:56.327 --> 01:09:58.260
but I may give you
some pointers on this.

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.050
Electric and
magnetic fields, they

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.240
generate pressures, at
least in certain directions.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.210
They kind of generate like
an anisotropic pressure.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:09.300
And when we start
coupling this to gravity,

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.490
you can get electric
fields and magnetic fields

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:17.020
that contribute non-negligibly
to the gravity of their object.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.600
That is it for the
stress energy tensor.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.660
As I said, we are going to
use this guy over, and over,

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:23.650
and over again.

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:26.290
And the reason for
this does come back

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:30.520
to that little motivation that
I gave probably about 45 minutes

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.810
ago where we sort of looked at
the Newtonian field equation,

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:37.780
and then said, picking
out a particular scalar

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.970
as the source of
gravity makes no sense

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.740
in a relativistic
covariant theory.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.960
It's got to be the whole tensor.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.200
And indeed, this is the
one-- well, not the E&M one,

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.540
but the general notion
of a stress energy tensor

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.130
is the one that we are
going to use for that.

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:57.570
So we have about
10 minutes left.

01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:02.480
And so I would like to start
the process of switching gears.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.010
Before I do that, are
there any questions?

01:11:10.022 --> 01:11:10.980
I will clean the board.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.060
So the reason we
are switching gears

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:30.470
is we now have probably the
most important physical tools

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.750
that we need in order
to start thinking

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:37.490
about making a relativistic
theory of gravity.

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:40.730
But we need a few more
mathematical tools.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:46.910
In particular, I'm going to
argue in a couple of lectures

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:50.930
that flat spacetime is
not sufficient for us

01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:52.220
to build a theory of gravity.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.180
We're going to need
to-- first of all,

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.500
you're going to have to
understand what that means.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.083
And we're not quite
ready to go there.

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:57.523
So for now, it's
just fancy words.

01:11:57.523 --> 01:11:58.940
But I'm going to
have to introduce

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.310
some kind of a notion of
curvature into things.

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:03.050
What does that even mean really?

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:05.400
We need to have the
tools to do that.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.170
And so as a prelude to
going in that direction--

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.453
I will call this my
prelude to curvature--

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.840
what we're going
to start doing is

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:29.535
flat spacetime in
curvilinear coordinates.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.130
And the importance
of doing this,

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:37.350
why this is going
to be useful to us

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:40.770
is that it will introduce a--

01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:42.030
it'll keep the physics simple.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:44.130
It's still going to
be special relativity,

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.230
but it's now going
to special relativity

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:51.930
using a mathematical structure
in which the basis vectors are

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:53.490
no longer constant.

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:54.990
So that's going to
allow us to begin

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:57.450
making a couple of the
mathematical tools that

01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:00.610
are necessary to build
gravity into this theory.

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:08.220
So we'll start by
replacing this with just

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:17.520
simple plain polar coordinates
mapped in the usual way.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.710
So if we want to
go back and forth,

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:24.620
well, at least one
way transformation,

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.602
I build x and y from r
and phi in that usual way.

01:13:27.602 --> 01:13:29.060
There's an inverse
mapping as well,

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.460
which involves trig functions.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.970
So I'm not going
to write it down.

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:37.450
One point which I really
want to emphasize here

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:41.635
is we are going to continue
to use a coordinate basis.

01:13:55.070 --> 01:14:11.780
And to remind you
what that means,

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:17.650
so a coordinate basis means that
the differential displacement

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:25.120
vector from an event
a to a nearby event b

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.120
is simply related
by differentials

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.488
of my coordinate contracted
onto my basis vectors.

01:14:32.488 --> 01:14:34.030
But when I'm working
in a curvilinear

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:52.090
coordinate system like
this, that means one of them

01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.120
has a somewhat different form
from what you are used to.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.890
When you guys talk
about the differential

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:59.015
of a displacement in just
about every physics class

01:14:59.015 --> 01:15:01.030
up to now, if you have
a differential angle,

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.450
you'd want to throw an r.

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.440
So this has the
dimensions of length.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.090
We ain't going to do that.

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:13.867
And so what this means,
since this is an angle,

01:15:13.867 --> 01:15:16.075
every component of this has
the dimensions of length.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:28.498
That means that
my basis vector is

01:15:28.498 --> 01:15:30.790
going to be something that
has the dimensions of length

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:33.310
associated with it.

01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:37.525
This in turn means that this is
not going to be a normal basis.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.000
That's unfortunately a
somewhat loaded word.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.352
What I mean by that is that
it has not been normalized.

01:15:50.352 --> 01:15:52.560
But given that you guys have
spent all of your career

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.090
thinking about the dot product
of a unit vector with itself--

01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.890
of a basis vector with
itself being equal to 1,

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.227
the other meaning of normal
might be good for you, too.

01:16:01.227 --> 01:16:03.060
The key thing which I
want to emphasize here

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:07.320
is e phi dot e phi
does not equal 1.

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.685
One other little bit
of notation which

01:16:16.685 --> 01:16:17.810
I would like to introduce--

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:26.070
so we are going to want to
talk about transformations

01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:28.508
between different
representations.

01:16:28.508 --> 01:16:30.300
We've done this-- so
far, we have generally

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.930
focused on moving between
different reference frames.

01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.662
I want to generalize
this notion.

01:16:35.662 --> 01:16:37.620
And I'm going to tweak
my notation a little bit

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.930
to indicate the difference.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:59.660
So I'm going to call
capital L alpha mu

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:07.060
bar what I get when I just look
at the variation of the alpha

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.960
coordinate system--

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.870
sorry-- the unbarred coordinate
system with the barred one.

01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:14.820
So this is just--

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.020
there's no deep things here.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.550
I just want you to be familiar
with the notation which

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:18.810
I'm going to use.

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:26.552
I will always reserve lambda
for the Lorentz Transformation.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.020
So in the interest of time, I'll
just write down one of these.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.728
So this sort of means
like, for instance,

01:17:39.728 --> 01:17:41.410
suppose that I'm transforming.

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:47.810
Let's let barred indicate
my polar coordinates.

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:50.840
Unbarred be Cartesian.

01:18:10.982 --> 01:18:13.664
These things are surprisingly
sticky sometimes.

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:28.280
So if I want to transform
in one direction

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.340
between my barred
and my unbarred ones,

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.620
this matrix will go through it.

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.640
And it looks like this.

01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:03.900
So this is the thing which
I will call l alpha mu bar.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.210
In my notes, I also give
the inverse transformation.

01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:07.667
And I will actually write--

01:19:07.667 --> 01:19:08.250
you know what?

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:08.610
I have minute.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:10.068
I will write that
one down as well.

01:19:13.972 --> 01:19:16.180
If you want to know how to
go in the other direction,

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.220
it's just the matrix
that inverts this.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.520
The reason I decided to
take the extra 30 seconds

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.670
or so to write
this down is I want

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:46.130
to call out the fact that in
this kind of transformation,

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.650
because of the fact that this
is a coordinate basis that

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:52.490
has this somewhat
unusual property,

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:56.280
different elements of the matrix
have different dimensions.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.910
It's a feature, not a bug.

01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:01.420
So this is going to show up.

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:03.560
I'm going to do a
couple more calculations

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.190
with this a little
bit tomorrow-- sorry--

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.882
not tomorrow, on Tuesday.

01:20:08.882 --> 01:20:11.090
This is going to show up in
the way the metric looks.

01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:12.950
The metric is going to have
a very different character

01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:14.400
in this coordinate system.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.530
And we're going to
see the way in which--

01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:18.800
it basically boils down
to it's going to pick up

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.490
a non-trivial functional form.

01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:22.370
It's not going to
just be a constant.

01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:24.800
And that fundamentally
reflects the fact

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.570
that the basis vectors
are not constant anymore.

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:31.570
We'll end it there.

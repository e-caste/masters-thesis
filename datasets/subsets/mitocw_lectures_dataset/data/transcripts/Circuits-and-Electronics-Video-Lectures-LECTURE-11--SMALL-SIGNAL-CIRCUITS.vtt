WEBVTT

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have put some of the quiz
stats here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The mean was about 75%.
And I must tell you that that

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is very impressive.
I guess MIT undergrads never

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
cease to amaze me.
And this was not an easy quiz.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This was a relatively hard
quiz.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And that average implies that
you guys did well on a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
relatively hard quiz.
Good.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's get back to our final
lecture on amplifiers and small

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
signal circuits.
And as always let me start with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a review.
Very quickly --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
-- we came up with a notation
to represent small signals.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And our notation looked like
this.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Our total variable was small
and capital, and this was a DC

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
bias and this was a small
signal.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is also called the
operating point.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And the small signal is also
called the incremental signal.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In general, if you have some
function, some variable of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
interest in the circuit,
say a total variable V out,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
let's say it relates to some
input variable as F of VI.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So mathematically we can find
out V out by simply finding the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
slope of this function at the
operating point and then

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
multiplying it by the
incremental change in the input.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Gold standard math.
So we do the slope of this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
function and evaluate it at the
operating point.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So this would give us the slope
of the function.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And multiply that by small VI,
which is incremental change.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
This is standard math.
What this will tell you is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
given a small change in VI this
function gives you,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
this expression gives you the
small change in V out.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And in lecture we have pretty
much used this method so far,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
used the math to get to where
we wanted it to be.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And then the way we provided
biasing and so on was for our

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
amplifier in particular we had a
bias voltage,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
some small signal value,
VS.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And this was output which was
also given to be some output

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
operating point plus a small
change, which was a change in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the output voltage.
So what we have done here is

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
mathematically computed small V
out.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And what I am showing you here
is to get the same effect in a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
circuit is you build your
circuit and replace what used to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
be a total variable with a DC
bias plus a small change.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then you will get your
output here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And this output will relate to
this input using this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
expression.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So this is more review.
To continue on with the math

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.000
review, for our amplifier VO was
given to be VS-K/2(vI-VT)^2 RL.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So this was the output versus
input relationship for the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
amplifier.
And mathematically I could get

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the small change in the output
VO by simply differentiating

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
this function with respect to
VI, evaluating that function,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
at capital VI and multiplying
by the small change in the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
input.
And the resulting expression

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that we got for small VO --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
-- was simply minus K,
this was our DC value,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and RL times small VI.
So we derived all of this the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
last time.
So nothing new so far.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So my small signal output was
some function given by

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
K(VI-VT)RL times small vi.
And notice that this is how VI

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
relates to VO.
And this is a constant with

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
respect to VI.
V capital I is a DC bias,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
so this is a constant.
So therefore this is the linear

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
relationship that we had set out
to get.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This term here,
for reasons we will see today,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
this term here K(VI-VT) is
called gm.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Transconductance.
We will look at it in more

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
detail a little later.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Even more review.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So I can draw the transfer
function and plot VO versus VI.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Another way to graphically view
what is going on is by plotting

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the load line curve for this
circuit, so this is VI.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I said we draw that by
first plotting the --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
These were our MOSFET curves.
And we know that at some point

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
the MOSFET gets into saturation,
so this curve was iDS=K/2 VO^2.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And to the right side of the
curve the MOSFET is in

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
saturation.
And we said we will adhere to

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the saturation discipline and
operate in this regime.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
When the MOSFET gets into this
region it is in its triode

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
region.
And then we could draw the load

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
line here.
The load line codified the

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
following relationship,
iDS=VS/RL-VO/RL.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This was a load line.
So I have superimposed a load

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
line on the device
characteristics,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and I am going to show you a
little demonstration based on

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that at this point.
So these curves were drawn for

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
increasing values of VI.
And if I choose some operating

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
point here then this point would
correspond to some bias,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
this bias point would
correspond to some input voltage

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
VI, a corresponding output bias
VO and a corresponding current

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
iDS.
So iDS capitals,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
VO capitals,
VI capitals represent the

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
operating point values for our
little circuit.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So far there is nothing new.
One thing we stopped the last

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
time by pointing out that the
gain of our amplifier,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
this is the gain,
-K(VI-VT)RL.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
That is the gain A of the
amplifier.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
That gain related to VI.
A gain was proportional to

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
VI-VT.
So therefore if I increased VI,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I would get more gain.
So the question is how do we

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
choose a bias point?
And in our particular example,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
let's say we are free to play
around with VI.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So we play around with VI and I
can choose various bias points.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So where do you set the bias
point?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
What are the various
characteristics of the circuit

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that relate to my bias point?
Well, first,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
of course, is gain.
The gain depends on how I

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
choose VI.
I will show you that in a

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
moment.
The second important thing,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in other words,
if I choose a bias point that

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
is a small VI then my gain is
going to be smaller.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
If I choose a bias point that's
at a much higher value of VI,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I get a bigger gain.
The second important

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
consideration is operating
range.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Notice that if I choose a bias
point here then as the input

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
changes --
Notice VI in this graph goes up

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
or down, and I would be
traversing and following

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
different lines here in my
MOSFET characteristic.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And as VI increases the
operating point would come up

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
here and so on.
So if about this operating

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
point I varied my input voltage
VI then, so let's say about this

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
operating point,
if my input VI,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
my small signal VI varied about
a small range then

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
correspondingly the output value
would vary about this part of my

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
load line.
So notice now that the

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
operating range,
how far can VI vary before the

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
MOSFET goes out of its
saturation discipline?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Well, on the low side my VI can
come down to here.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And we looked at the operating
ranges for an amplifier.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And I can come all the way down
to VT.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
At that point the output will
come here.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Similarly at the high end VI
could get up to a high value.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And we computed that value in
the last lecture.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And the corresponding value of
the input would be here.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So in some sense I can traverse
all the way from here to here

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and have the MOSFET remain in
saturation.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Remember we are not talking
about linearity right now,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
just about the valid operating
range based on my definition

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
which is that the MOSFET should
stay in saturation.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So if I chose my operating
point here then I get this range

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
here.
And, on the other hand,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
if I chose my operating point
to be here, for negative

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
excursions of the input signal I
have a very small amount before

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I hit cutoff.
So if I chose my operating

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
point here then for negative
traversals of VI about the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
operating point I very quickly
hit cutoff.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So if I want symmetric swings
then this is the best that I can

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
do in terms of the valid input
operating range if I want

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
symmetric swings given that this
is my bias point.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
On the other hand,
if I chose my bias point

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
somewhere here,
or very carefully chose my bias

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
point then my input can vary on
a much wider region and still

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
get symmetric swings.
And so therefore the choice of

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
bias point also influences the
maximum swing range of my input

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
signal.
I shouldn't call this operating

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
range.
I should call it input swing

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
range.
We defined the valid input

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
operating range as the range for
which the amplifier satisfied

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
the saturation discipline.
So the two key issues,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
gain and the input swing.
Let me show you a quick demo

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and try to point out on a graph
some of the characteristics that

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
relate to the matter we have
been talking about so far.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So what I show here are these
curves for the MOSFET.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
This is VO and this iDS.
This is the zero point.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Ignore this line down here.
This line up here corresponds

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
to the output voltage VO.
What I am going to do now is,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
through some careful circuit
hacking, I'm going to show show

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
you a load line and show you the
bias point, and show you how the

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
bias point can be moved up and
down by changing the input

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
voltage which changes the
corresponding output voltage.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It is hardly visible out there.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Is it there?
OK.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It is not really clear,
but notice that as I increase

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
my input, I am increasing my
input.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
My output keeps coming down.
And I hope your eyesight is

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
better than mine because I don't
see a dot up there.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I am amazed.
This is the first time this has

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
happened to me.
That's OK.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
All right.
As you can see,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
as I change the input value the
output operating point changes,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and the dot out there
traverses, articulates a load

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
line.
I guess I have to believe that

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
there is a dot out there.
Next what I will do is show you

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
some more fun stuff.
What I will do is instead of

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
having just a dot by having a DC
voltage, let me apply an input

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
sinusoid.
So if I apply an input sinusoid

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
at some bias then I should see
an articulation of the

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
corresponding region of the load
line corresponding to the input.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So, as you can see here,
now the bottom line,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
here is my input and this is my
output.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And notice that this the region
of the load line articulated

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
when the input is of this
magnitude.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Now let's have some fun.
As I increase my input,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
you can see that a larger
portion of the load line is

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
articulated, right?
There you go.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And as I decrease my input a
smaller region of the load line

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
is articulated.
Let's leave it here for a

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
moment.
And what I will do next,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
this is the region here that we
are looking at,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
let me increase the bias.
If I increase the bias,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
if I increase VI,
what do you think should happen

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
to this line here?
Well, if I increase the bias,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
the line should go up,
right?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Because remember the dot?
The dot is in the middle of

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
this thing here.
If I increase the bias this

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
should move up here.
So that line moves up.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Do you expect anything else to
happen to that line?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Pardon?
It increases,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
exactly.
If I increase the bias point to

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
here then this must also
increase because my gain has

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
increased.
Let me do that.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So let me increase the input
bias.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Indeed notice that the region
of the load line articulated is

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
larger now.
Let me decrease the bias.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And notice that because the
gain is smaller the little

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
segment shown is also smaller.
I have shown you two things so

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
far.
One is that I as I increase my

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
bias the line indeed rises up
corresponding to a higher value

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
for the input operating point.
And the second is that I get a

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
larger swing in the output as I
increase the bias.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Just to show that for those
like me who were visually

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
challenged in terms of viewing
that little dot up there,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
let me get some audio so you
can actually hear the sinusoidal

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
tone.
It is a big annoying.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
As I reduce the bias the gain
is decreased.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
As I increase the bias you can
see that the gain is increased

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and the tone is louder.
Let's have some more fun and

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
let's play some music now.
And what I am going to show you

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
with the music --
The reason I play the music is

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
not just for fun.
Well, it's 85% fun and 15%

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
learning.
Can we turn it on for a second?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
What I would like to do is,
as we play the music,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
the reason I am playing the
music for that 15% is so you can

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
listen to distortion.
I want you to listen to the

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
distortion.
That is when the articulation

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
is here you are not going to get
much distortion.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But as I get into cutoff you
should be getting a bunch of

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
distortion.
Similarly, as you get into the

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
triode region you should also be
getting distortion because the

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
amplification from being
somewhat nonlinear here becomes

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
highly nonlinear at those two
points.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So let's just play the signal.
So volume increases,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
or rather the amplitude
increases by increasing the

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
bias.
Now you should hear the volume

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
go down and distortion.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So notice now that the bias
point is way down here.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So the gain is very low,
and plus there is a distortion

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
because of cutoff.
Now what I will do is blast it

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
up here, and you will see that
the volume has gone up but then

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
you see distortion again.
Let's see if you can stand the

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
volume here.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Even the CD doesn't like that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Notice that as I went up here
the volume kept increasing

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
because the gain kept
increasing, but as I got into

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
the triode region I began to
lose my gain because,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
remember, the amplifier doesn't
have gain in the triode region,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
MOSFET in its triode region,
and we also get a bunch of

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
distortion out there.
Finally, it turns out that as

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
people are building amplifiers
--

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I think this was in the mid to
late `50s and `60s and so on.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
They said man,
electrical engineers are not

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
going to get their thing right.
So they invented a new kind of

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
music which was much more
tolerant to distortion.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And I will play that music for
you.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
It is called hard rock.
I challenge you to tell me it

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
is distorting.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Sounds good to me.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
OK.
All right.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
That'll do it.
Thank you.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
I hope there are no hard rock
musicians in here who will come

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and beat me up after lecture or
something.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
All right.
Believe it or not most of that

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
was review.
There is nothing new today

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
besides some fun and games and
so on.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I will give you a breather for
five seconds before jumping into

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
something even more fun.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I want you to look at the
middle board here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And, as I told you in the
beginning of 6.002,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
engineering is about building
useful systems.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Engineering is not about
showing off at math or saying

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
man, I am really cool in math
and stuff.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Engineering is about building
useful systems,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
and you want to find the
simplest, easiest,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
cheapest way to get there.
Unlike deep areas of math and

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
theory and so on,
the beauty is in the

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
simplicity.
So the aesthetics are in how

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
simply can we make things and
still get to where we want to

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
be?
All through the course what you

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
will be seeing happening again
and again and again is when

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
things begin to get too grovelly
in terms of math,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
we will step back and say oops,
we are engineers,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
remember?
Let's find a much simpler way

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
to do it and use intuition.
So time and time and time

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
again, I am going to take you on
a simpler path where you can

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
solve things by inspection by
pure intuition.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Most circuit designers do that.
So take a look at this.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I don't like this nasty
differentiation here.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
That's getting into late high
school calculus and so on.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Let's avoid the math and let's
see if you find some way of

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
doing it that is even much more
simpler.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
And that is what I will do next
and show you what is called the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
small signal circuit view.
A purely circuit way of

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
developing the small signal
model.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So let me just start by drawing
the large signal equivalent

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
circuit for you.
I will draw it here for reasons

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
that will be obvious at the end
of the class.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
All right.
This is the large signal

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
equivalent circuit model for our
MOSFET amplifier.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
VS and here is my current
source.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
iDS relates to the square of VI
minus VT.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
So stare at that for a second.
And that is a nonlinear

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
circuit.
iDS relates to the square of VI

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
minus VT.
Let me start by making the

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
following claim.
Let me shoot from the hip here

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
and make the following grand
claim, and then I will show you

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
how I can prove that claim.
The grand claim I am about to

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
make says the following.
A bunch of little devices here.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It is a nonlinear circuit.
Just suppose for a moment we do

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
a Gedanken experiment.
Suppose I replace each of my

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
circuit elements here with its
linearized element equivalent.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
In other words,
here is a VS source,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
here is a dependent current
source, let me replace them with

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
their linear equivalent circuit
models.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
In other words,
with their corresponding small

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
signal element models.
And I will show you what those

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
are in a second.
The resistor has a

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
corresponding small signal
element.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
The dependent current source
has a corresponding small signal

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
behavioral element model.
And what I am going to do is

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
keep the same circuit
connections and simply pull out

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
the large signal model for the
element and replace it with a

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
small signal element model.
And by the nature of the small

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
signal model they are all going
to be linear.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
So what I am going to be left
with is a linear circuit with

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
simple linear circuit elements
in there.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And then once I have a linear
circuit, I should be able to

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
analyze that linear circuit
using methods 1,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
2 and 3, superposition,
Thevenin, node method and so

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
on.
And certainly the intuitive

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
methods like superposition and
Thevenin, which make life a lot

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
easier for me with linear
models, and thereby get the

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
function that I am looking for
very quickly.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Again, my claim is that I can
replace each of these large

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
signal models by just small
signal equivalents and then just

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
analyze the resultant circuit.
And I claim that I should be

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
able to get the same answer.
That's a claim.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
All right?
So what I will do is give you

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
an informal proof for why I can
do that.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And I also ask you to refer to
Section 8.2.1 of the course

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
notes to go through the
foundations of the small circuit

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
model in more detail.
The intuition is that,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
remember KVL and KCL?
I can write down KVL and KCL

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
for every loop in that circuit
and every node in that circuit.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
If I do KVL and KCL,
I will end up with something

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
like this.
For the input loop I get VI

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
something or the other applying
KVL.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
For the output loop I get V out
something or the other.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And then applying KCL I get
some other equation in iDS.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
So here are my KVL and KCL
equations for that circuit.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Now, KVL and KCL are simply a
different representation of the

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
circuit because within those KVL
and KCL is encoded the topology

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
of the circuit.
Remember each KVL equation

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
represents a loop and each KCL
equation represents how nodes

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
are connected together.
So KVL and KCL equations encode

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
within them the topology of my
circuit.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
What I do next is,
say, I replace each of these

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
with the bias plus the small
signal, so I get the bias plus

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
the small signal and keep the
equations the same.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
All I have done in my big set
of KVL, KCL equations,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
I have simply replaced the
total variable with the large

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
signal variable and the small
signal quantity.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Then comes a key trick.
The key trick is that because

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
the bias point variables,
they are a valid solution to

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
the circuit.
The circuit is in this

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
quiescent state,
and those are valid solutions

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
to circuit.
So therefore I can cancel them

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
out.
So the VI, the large signal

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
values can be cancelled out
leaving just small signal

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
variables in there.
So from the KVL,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
KCL equations I can cancel out
the large signal values,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
the DC bias points because they
satisfy the KVL and KCL

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
themselves.
In other words,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I could have written VI plus V
out and so on.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Since they are satisfied I just
strike out the large signal

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
variable from both sides of each
of these equations,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
so what is left is the same
KVL, KCL equations but with

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
small variables in place of the
big variables.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
What that should tell you,
this informal proof should tell

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
you is that the small signal
variables should then satisfy

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
the same form of the KVL,
KCL equations that the total

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
variables satisfy.
And because the KVL,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
KCL equations are a reflection
of the topology of the circuit,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
what that says is that the
small signal variables must also

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
satisfy KVL and KCL.
And since these arrive from the

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
small signal elements that says
that I can replace the big

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
elements with the small elements
and KVL and KCL will hold for

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
the resulting circuit.
This is a very quick breeze

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
through, an informal proof to
show that I can replace the big

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
elements with the corresponding
little element models and then

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
simply apply linear techniques.
Refer to Section 8.2.1 for more

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
foundations and more discussion
about the foundations for why we

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
can do this.
That brings up the small signal

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
circuit method.
The circuit method for small

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
signal analysis has three steps.
The first step is find

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000
operating point by using LS.
First you analyze your large

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
signal circuit and find the
operating point.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
You have to do this,
because remember,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:14.000
the small signal models depend
on the operating point values.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Remember the gain of our
amplifier depended on the bias

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
point.
Second step is develop small

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:34.000
signal models of elements.
Second step is take each of the

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
elements in your circuit and
find their equivalent small

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
circuit model for each of the
elements.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Third step is replace original
elements with their small signal

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
model elements.
Third step is simply take the

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
large elements and replace them
with their small signal

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
equivalent models.
Then analyze resulting circuit,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
and that circuit will be a
linear circuit.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
So let's do an example.
I will just use the amplifier

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000
as an example of this method.
And convince you that you are

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
going to get the same expression
at the end, but just so,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
so simply without even the
smallest amount of grubby math.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Three steps.
The first step is to find the

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
operating point using the large
signal model.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And let me just do that here.
I get my V out =

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
VS-K/2(VI-VT)^2 RL.
Let me just write down that out

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
here.
Don't worry about copying that

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
down.
It is on the last page of your

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
notes.
The first step of the method

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
simply applies the large signal
model and finds out the behavior

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
of that circuit to find out what
the bias point values are.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
The second step is to develop
the small signal model of my

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
elements.
How do I go about developing

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
the small signal models of
elements?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Let's start with the MOSFET.
The large signal model for the

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
MOSFET looks like this.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Here is my Vgs.
This is my gate.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
This is my drain.
This is my source.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And I know my iDS to be
K/2(Vgs-VT)^2.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So this is the large signal
model for the MOSFET,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
again in saturation.
I am talking about all of these

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
models are under the saturation
discipline.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
So Vgs relates to iDS in the
following way for the MOSFET.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
That is iDS,
is K/2 and that is my square

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
law relationship.
So what is a corresponding

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
small signal model?
I go ahead and start with this.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
The corresponding small signal
model simply says that iDS

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
relates to Vgs in the following
way.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
All I have to do is find a
small signal equivalent where I

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
need to find out,
given a small change in the

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
input Vgs, what is the small
change in the iDS?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
So I can apply my standard
trick to a much simpler

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
expression here,
which is iDS simply,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I differentiate this function
with respect to Vgs.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
So I don't completely eliminate
the math here,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
but it is a much simpler
problem here.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
At Vgs equals the bias point
times small vgs.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I can find the small change in
iDS corresponding to a small

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
change in the input using this
expression.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
That gives me iDS as simply
K(Vgs-VT) vgs.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
I call this gm,
and I will tell you why in a

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
second.
So what does this expression

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
say?
This expression says that if I

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
have a small change in Vgs then
this will be my small change in

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
iDS.
Notice that the resulting small

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
signal model is also a dependent
current source.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
It is a voltage controlled
dependent current source.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So the output is the current,
and it is a dependent current

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
source and it depends on the
input voltage.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
The good news is that notice
that this one,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
this expression here gm is a
constant related to the bias

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
point values.
Therefore, notice that the

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
small signal model for the
MOSFET in saturation,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
not surprisingly,
is a linear voltage controlled

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
current source according to the
following expression.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
So iDS=gm Vgs.
Gm is a representation for

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
K(Vgs-VT) and is called a
transconductance.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
It is called a transconductance
because it, in some sense,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
deflects the conductance
properties of this based on the

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
input.
So it is a transconductance.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
So this value is called Vgs.
Therefore, I can build the

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.000
small signal model as follows.
Vgs is a voltage controlled

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
current source and iDS is simply
gm Vgs.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
So this is my gate,
drain, source.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So that is the small signal
model for my MOSFET.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
As a next step what are the
other elements in my circuit?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Let's see.
I have a voltage source and I

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
have a resistor,
so let me find out the

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
corresponding small signal model
for a DC supply VS.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
This is Page 7.
I will do it mathematically for

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
you, but often times it is
always good to do a sanity check

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
using intuition.
Let me ask you,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000
the large signal for a DC
supply looks like this.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
The element law for a voltage
source is VS equals some capital

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
VS.
It is a constant voltage.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
So what do you expect to be the
small signal model for a voltage

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
source?
In other words,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
for a small change,
suppose I have a small change

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
in the current,
by how much should the output

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
VS change?
It shouldn't change.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
It is a voltage source.
So what does intuition tell you

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
is a small signal model for the
voltage source?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
A short.
So the key here is that a

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
voltage source behaves like a
short circuit for small

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
perturbations.
In other words,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
if I change the current flowing
through it by a small amount

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
somehow, the output is still
going to held at VS.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
In other words,
small signals are simply going

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
to scoot through this voltage
source without having any impact

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000
whatsoever on the voltage.
Or mathematically I could also

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
do small vs is del by del IS of
VS evaluated at IS equals some

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
capital IS times small IS.
And therefore VS equals zero.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
What that means is that the
small signal model for my

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
voltage source is simply a short
circuit.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
So in a small circuit voltage
sources appear like a short

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
circuit.
Finally, I have a resistor,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
my resistor R.
Let me find out its

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
corresponding small signal
model.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000
The large signal model looks
like this R, VR,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
IR.
And I know that VR is simply

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
RIR.
And to find the small signal

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
equivalent I do del of IRR
divided by del IR for IR

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
calculated at some constant
value times small IR.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
What I am looking to do is to
find out what is the change in

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
the voltage across R for a small
perturbation in the current?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Again, let me exhort you to
rely on intuition to at least

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
sanity check your answers.
So what do you think this

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
should look like?
It's a resistor and I have a

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
small change in the current,
by what do you expect the

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
voltage to change?
Think about,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
for the next five seconds,
what the small signal model for

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
this should look like and then I
will go ahead and write down the

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
answer.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
So differentiating I simply get
RIR.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
In other words,
for a resistor the small signal

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
model is the resistor itself.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
So what I have done so far,
let me just take you through

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
where we are right now,
give you the big picture there.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I began by suggesting that
looking to find an even simpler

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
way to do small signal analysis.
I gave you an informal proof to

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
show that if I had small signal
element models for all of my

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
elements, I could simply replace
them in the circuit and then do

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
a corresponding linear circuit
analysis phase to get the result

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I am looking for.
There are three steps to the

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
method.
As a first step we began by

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
finding small signal models for
each of our elements.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
For the nonlinear MOSFET the
small signal model was a linear

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
dependent current source.
For a voltage source the

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
corresponding small signal model
was a short circuit.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Again, that makes sense
intuitively if I change the

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
current through a voltage source
by a small amount.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
By how much does the voltage
change?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
It is a voltage source,
silly.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
The voltage doesn't change.
So the small signal V,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
the small change in the voltage
is zero, and that is the same

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
thing as a short circuit.
For a resistor by how much does

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
the voltage change if I change
the current by a small amount?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Well, it will change by R times
the current change,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
and that is the property of a
resistor, R.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
As a final step what I would
like to do, on Page 8,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
I'd like to very quickly draw
for you the small signal circuit

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
and then analyze it.
This is the large signal

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
circuit.
That is a large signal circuit.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And let me draw the small
signal circuit.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And the method says simply
pluck out, gouge out each of

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
these elements.
And simply replace each of

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
these nasty nonlinear elements
with the corresponding small

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
signal linear equivalents.
So let's do that.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Remember, for the input you
replace input with its small

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
signal voltage because I am
telling you that it's sourcing a

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
small change in VI.
So that is VI.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
And then I replace a short for
VS.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I replace an R for RL because
it is an RL itself for the small

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
signal model.
And then for the dependent

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:27.000
source, we discovered that the
dependent source was a linear

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:35.000
dependent source given where
ids=gmvi.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Remember, this was my small VO.
Here you go.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
I have a small signal circuit
here where I have simply created

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
that by replacing each of the
big elements by little

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
rinky-dink elements.
Now these are all linear

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
elements so I can do a really
simple linear analysis.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
What method shall we use?
Well, this is so simple.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
I will just go ahead and use
the node method.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
So applying the node method at
the node with voltage VO,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
what I will do is the current
going up, VO divided by RL

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
equals the current going down
iDS.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:27.000
And so the current going up is
VO divided by RL and the current

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
going down is --
Oops, I should have done this.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.000
The total current going out is
zero, so the sum of these two is

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
zero.
That is my good old node method

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
here.
And I know that iDS is simply

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
gmvi equals zero.
So right there I have the

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:03.000
relationship between VO and VI.
So VO is simply minus gmviRL.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:11.000
And remember gm was simply K VI
minus VT.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
We are done,
OK?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
What have we here?
I created a linear circuit

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
which simply comprised small
signal models for each of my big

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
elements.
And then I simply did a

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
straightforward linear analysis
using any one of the linear

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
techniques I knew about.
This is simple enough so I

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
apply the node method.
And I've got the equation at

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
this node, simplified it and I
directly got the answer.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
In one or two steps I directly
gave you the output as a

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
function of the input.
It can't get any simpler.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Thank you.

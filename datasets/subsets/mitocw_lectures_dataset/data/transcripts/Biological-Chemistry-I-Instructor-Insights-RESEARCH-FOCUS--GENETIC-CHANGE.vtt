JOHN ESSIGMANN: I work in
the field of genetic change.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.200
In a perfect world,
you would say,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.420
guanine would always
pair with cytosine

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.180
and adenine would always
pair with thymine.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.920
It turns out, however,
that sometimes chemicals

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.930
from the environment can react
with our normal nucleotides

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.330
and change their coding
characteristics so

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.150
that mistakes are made when
polymerases try to read them.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.690
These are mutations,
and mutations

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.860
cause genetic diseases.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.960
My role in the
field of toxicology

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.620
is as a person, who is both
a biologist and a chemist,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.290
who studies how chemical damage
to our informational molecules

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.870
is converted into
changes in coding

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.164
that results in genetic change.

00:00:58.164 --> 00:00:59.580
I'll emphasize,
of course, this is

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.700
the basis for all
genetic disease,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.220
but it's also the
basis for evolution.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.660
In other words, mutations
happen naturally.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.770
That means that we're not
all-- we don't all look alike.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.950
And that means there's
diversity in a population,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.900
and that's because of mutations.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.970
And evolution is a
really good thing,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.090
because if we were all alike
when the environment changed,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.960
then the chance of extinction
might be very high.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.660
If there's diversity
in a population,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.440
that's actually a hedge
that life uses in order

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.230
to be able to make sure
something's going to survive,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.480
because some members
in the population,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.160
while they may be
considered quote

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.530
unquote "weaker" in the
initial environment, when

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.749
the environment changes--

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.790
they're the ones, for
example, with hair on them,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.610
and survive the global
winter that happens

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.440
after the meteor strikes.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.830
So, we are interested
in chemical modification

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.420
of DNA and RNA as it relates
to the causation of disease,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.870
but we're also
interested in the rates

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.260
at which genetic change
happens in a population,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.840
and how that's a good
thing, and that it provides

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.010
for the continuance of life.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.800
One example of our
work in evolution

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.870
comes from recent work that
we've been doing on HIV.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.200
When a virus infects
one of our cells,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.600
our cells respond by trying to
limit the growth of the virus.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.100
They try to kill it.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.530
And one of the
strategies that used

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.080
by what's called our
innate immune system

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.450
is to induce a number
of enzymes that start

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.850
to rip apart the DNA bases.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.520
They really take
the amino groups off

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.460
of cytosines and
adenines in order

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.790
to try to convert them
into non-coding nucleotides

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.800
or miscoding nucleotides.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.082
What happens is, if
you take a cytosine

00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:56.540
and you take away
it's amino group,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.400
it makes it into a uracil,
and then, rather than

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.580
pair with a guanine, it'll
pair with an adenine.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.680
Because these are
enzymes that kind of move

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.040
along the viral genome,
they create a huge number

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.720
of mutations.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.030
The process is called
lethal mutagenesis,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.430
because what happens
is, eventually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.890
the number of mutations
is so large that you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.810
can no longer
produce a functional

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.450
protein or nucleic acid.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.560
That's a natural
strategy that we use.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.460
And thinking about
this, some years ago,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.160
given my lab's
expertise in knowing

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.430
about the structural
modification of normal bases

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.770
that makes them
mutagenic, we wondered

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.150
if we could contaminate the
nucleotide pool of a cell

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.500
with mutagenic nucleotides
that would force a virus

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.050
to mutate even quicker.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.560
HIV, it turns out, almost
goes extinct, but not quite.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.340
In other words, our innate
immune system, in one day,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.360
creates every single point
mutation in the virus,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.760
but it also creates every
single drug-resistant variant.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.020
And it just doesn't
push hard enough

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.730
to be able to push the
virus to extinction.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.570
So, we wondered whether-- if
we could push a little harder

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.050
by using creatively
designed molecules--

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.790
derivatives of cytosine,
that would pretend sometimes

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.530
they're a cytosine and sometimes
they pretended that they were

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.600
a thymine--

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.520
that we could push the
virus over the top.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.200
And we found that
it did work, OK.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.210
In other words, we were
able to push the virus

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.790
to a technical state
of extinction using

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.000
our understanding of the
chemistry of the molecules

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.640
that the cell has the capability
to use in replication.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.090
It may seem unwise
to intentionally put

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.750
mutagenic chemicals into
people, and, obviously,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.520
we worked out a strategy to
prevent mutations in people

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.760
in the drug design process.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.210
Specifically, it turns
out there are pathways

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.210
called DNA repair
pathways that repair

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.235
damage in our nuclear genomes,
and they happen in the nucleus.

00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:13.570
That's where the
enzymes are located.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.820
It turns out that the early
stage in HIV replication

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.580
involved replication
in the cytoplasm.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.380
There are no repair
enzymes in the cytoplasm.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.840
So, the virus has no defense
against the mutagenic affects

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.730
of these compounds.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.410
We picked compounds
that, if they

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.560
were to get into our nuclei--

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.660
it turns out that our
polymerases don't like them

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.520
very much, anyway, but
if they did get in,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.500
they're very rapidly repaired.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.830
So, it creates what we call
a therapeutic index which

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.600
is very favorable in
favor of killing the virus

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.310
but not putting mutagenic
chemicals into us.

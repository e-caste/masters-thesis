00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:21.930
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.700
First of all, I was in
touch by email with George,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.890
and he asked me to flash
this up again, which

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.530
was from a couple
of lectures ago,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.910
because he thought this was
very critical and very important

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.220
that you sort of
understood what it says.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.790
So I'm going to just say
a few things about it.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.490
I guess the first
thing to note is

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.080
that it compares these
two different cases,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.710
coherent imaging and
incoherent imaging.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
And you see that, apart from
that, these two, the top half

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.670
and the bottom half,
are really identical.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.440
So you use the same
method in either case,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.260
except that, of course, in
the coherent case you're

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.770
working with amplitudes,
whereas in the incoherent case

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.900
you're working with intensities.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.360
But apart from that,
it's identical.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.300
So what it's saying is, if you
illuminate a thin transparency,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.390
then you get a field on the far
side of this transparency which

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.310
goes into your optical system.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.010
So this is his GN.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.640
And to calculate the
image, you can either

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.670
do it by convolving that
with a point spread function

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.280
to get the amplitude out, or you
can do it in the Fourier domain

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.480
by Fourier transforming
to get the object spectra,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.430
and then multiplying it
by a transfer function

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.093
and then getting the field out.

00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:06.010
And then once you've got
the field, of course,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.590
you can calculate the
intensity from that

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.930
just by doing the
modulus square.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.810
So the difference
between these two things

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.900
is here we working
with aptitudes,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.290
so we have a coherent
point spread function

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.470
and an amplitude
transfer function,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.070
whereas for this one,
the incoherent case,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.640
we have an intensity point
spread function, which is just

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.400
the modulus square of this.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.180
And here we have an optical
transfer function, which

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.570
is the autocorrelation of this.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.930
So that's really
all there is to do,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.670
all there is that you need to
know about calculating images.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.250
Any questions about that?

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.040
So I'll just-- as
I say, I'll just

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.880
flash that because George
said he wanted me to.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.310
And now we'll go on to
where we got up to last time

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.450
in the lecture.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.870
So George suggested-- he sent
me some more material for today,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.590
and he also asked me to add some
extra to it of my own material.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.860
But I don't know how
far we get with this.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.640
So we've still got some left
over from last time, actually,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.300
and then the bit
that George sent.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.100
You might be fed up by then.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.020
But anyway, if we've
still got some time

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.510
and you're not fed up, I'll
carry on with some stuff

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.440
that I put in there which
is to do with focusing.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.820
But it might be--
you might think

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.820
it's sort of rather higher level
than the rest of the course.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.210
So this is not for--

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.810
this bit that I've added is
not for examining or anything.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.940
It's meant just
for your interest.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.710
Anyway, this is where we
got up to, the defocus ATF.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.855
So this, again, you remember--

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:16.730
let's make it bigger.

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:24.300
Now, what's going on?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.555
I've gone the wrong thing.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:27.430
I should [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.580
Sorry.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.747
I haven't got my glasses on.

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:31.290
I can't see what I'm doing.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.870
And it's all in
a different place

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.730
from across the
version of PDF that--

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.500
PowerPoint that I use.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.520
Anyway, here we are,
the defocus ATF.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.760
So you remember, we
introduced this last time.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.150
We said that if you've
got a defocused object,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.800
then you can work
out the imaging of it

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.280
by using an amplitude transfer
function just like before,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.640
but it's not just
the normal one.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.550
It's modified by the
effects of defocus.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.600
What happens is that you
have to multiply the transfer

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.180
function by complex exponential,
e to the i, this thing.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.300
It therefore becomes complex.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.050
And you can divide that up
into two parts, a real part

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.090
and an imaginary part.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.300
The real part will image
the real information

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.190
of the objects,
which is basically

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.930
the absorption of the object.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.280
And that's what this shows here,
the real part of that transfer

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.210
function, which is
cosine of this thing.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.400
And so this is the cutoff
of the optical system here.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.900
Sorry.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.700
No, it isn't, is it?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.240
No, sorry.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.420
The cutoff, I guess,
is some arbitrary place

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.760
I guess it's not
actually shown here.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.430
But anyway, the
fact is that as you

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.340
change the amount
of defocus, this

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.690
will be scaled accordingly
relative to the cutoff

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.490
of the transfer function.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.700
So you can imagine if
the transfer function was

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.300
right in here, it would
be almost as though it was

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.350
the same as an in-focus system.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.010
And then as you make the
cutoff wider and wider

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.340
relative to this cos
curve, you see you getting

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.050
more and more of these wiggles.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.390
So this was a case where
it's not changing very much.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.230
So there we are.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.050
There's the region
where it's non-zero,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.380
and so it's not changing
very much in that region.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.680
And so we said that
corresponds to multifocus.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.110
And then the next
case we looked at

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.890
was now when it's
got a lot of defocus.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.520
So you can see here, it
starts really wiggling.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.410
Remember-- I said
this last time--

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.960
this is actually cos
of this thing squared.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.510
So that's why it doesn't look
like an ordinary cos function,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.130
because of the x squared.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.850
So it scales it in
this nonlinear way.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.610
And so here's the and it
cut off again in this case.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.280
Now, in this case
you've got some wiggles,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.660
and those wiggles are going to
lead to artifacts in the image.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.660
Firstly, because of the
fact this goes negative,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.300
you can see there's some
spatial frequencies will

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.800
be imaged with the wrong sign.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.210
So it's just like if
you've got a Fourier

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.020
series for, let's say, a square
wave, if you take the Fourier

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.590
series for a square wave and
you change the sign of some

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.920
of those components, it
doesn't look like a square wave

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.510
anymore.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.610
So you get a very poor
image in that case.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.860
So this is really bad
news for the image.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.370
And the other thing that
George mentions up there

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.930
is that, of course,
there's regions

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.390
where the value of the transfer
function is very small.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.100
So this spatial frequency
here, for example, is not

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.600
going to be imaged at all.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.260
So you'll get some
gaps in the response

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.321
of the different transfer
of spatial frequencies.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.500
So the significance of
depth of focus in imaging--

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.530
so here he shows a 4F system.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.700
It shows here the NA
in and the NA out.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.520
And you remember, of course,
that as you changed the NA,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.650
you also change
the magnification.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.540
You change the
lateral magnification,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.210
and you also change the
longitudinal or axial

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.410
magnification.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.360
That goes as the NA squared.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.710
And so we define
these two terms.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.910
Depth of field is basically
that the defocus tolerance

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.810
in the object space, so far
you can move the objects

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.030
without it going too
much out of focus.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:21.760
And so this gives some idea
about the value of that, then.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.490
The depth that
depth of a field is

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.975
given by this lambda
over 2NA squared.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.300
You get this NA squared because
the longitudinal magnification

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.320
also goes as NA squared.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.980
And then on the other
side, in the image side,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.160
you have a depth of focus
rather than a depth of field.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.300
Notice in the title, he calls
it DoF, which can mean either,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.290
so Depth of Field,
Depth of Focus.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.200
You'll find that, of course,
in general terminology people

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.520
often use these phrases
almost interchangeably

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.250
and are not very careful
about using the right one

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.070
for the right space.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.870
But this is what
it really means.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.050
Depth of field is how much
you can move the object.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:17.120
Depth of focus is how much
you can move the screen here

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.220
without it going out of focus.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:27.420
And you can see that this is
expressing the depth of focus

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.120
now in terms of
numerical aperture.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.830
You get the same
expression, but it's now

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.540
this NA rather than that one.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.440
But of course, the
magnification also

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.680
goes as NA squared as well.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.210
So the image of the bit that's
in focus, here, of the object

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:53.220
is, of course, the same as the
depth of focus of the system.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.500
Is that all clear?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.280
Yeah?

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.840
Good.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.390
OK.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.330
Even though our derivations
were carried out

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.870
for spatially coherent imaging,
exactly the same arguments

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.730
you can use for the
incoherent case.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.030
So the idea of a--

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.470
we showed the defocused
amplitude transfer function,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.740
in the same way you can
also have a defocused OTF.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.090
So let's think of
now what happens

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.490
if we've got some objects which
has got some height variations.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.820
Here he's taking the
case of a surface,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.760
and he's called this
a 2 and 1/2 D object.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.060
I think he's probably called
it that because I sometimes

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.122
use that terminology.

00:11:48.122 --> 00:11:49.330
I'm not the only one, really.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.440
I didn't invent it.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.860
But people often
use this 2 and 1/2 D

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.640
to represent something
which is not a 2D object.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.530
It's not flat, it's
got some depth.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.830
But it's not a true
3D object in that

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.090
it's got no internal structure.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.090
It's just a surface.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.720
So anyway, in this
case, this is the object

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.730
and this is its image.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.510
And you can see that if
this object is quite deep,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.420
it's going to be deeper
than that depth of field

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.660
of the system.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.910
And so some parts of that
are going to be out of focus.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.600
And so this is a
region, for example,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.890
which is a long way away
from the focal plane,

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.090
and therefore it's going
to be imaged out of focus.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.400
And here it corresponds
to this region here.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:48.390
Notice, if you look at this
image, it's inverted in x.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.770
But you see that
in the z direction,

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.760
a distance which is
moved this way here

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.930
is also moved this way here.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.880
So there's no inversion
in the z direction.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.760
Did I hear a question over
there or was it just someone

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.790
shuffling around?

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.290
No.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:08.790
OK.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:17.890
So as George points out
here, what this means then

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.190
for this particular object
is the point spread function

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.220
is not now spatially invariant.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:29.440
It's a spatially
shift variance PSF

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.920
because different
parts of this surface

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.440
are going to experience
a different point spread

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.615
function because they might
be in or out of focus.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.380
So yeah, and the part, just
like before, the part which

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.270
is in focus is given by this
depth of field, which we just

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:53.790
had before.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.360
So you can either think
of it as a depth of field

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.208
or a depth of focus,
the same expression.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.160
So this is an example of this.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.860
Let's take an object
which is a letter

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.650
M. I guess he didn't use MIT
this time because he wants

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:23.390
to use the same for each so that
you can see how each of them

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.210
is affected by the different
point spread function.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.320
So this is in the focal
plane, and then this

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.560
is to depth of fields
out of the focal plane.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.810
This is for depth the fields
out of the focal plane.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.260
So when you image
that you can see

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.780
that it's going to become--
this one's going to be in focus.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.280
It's still a bit
blurred, of course,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.250
because of the refraction
effect in the imaging.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.900
So this is convolved with
the point spread function

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.570
of the coherent optical system.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:15:00.350
And then this is for the
two defocused ones, getting

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.520
more and more out of focus.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.470
So right now, once
we've got that blur,

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.610
what can we do about it?

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.710
And there's been
quite a lot of papers

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.080
that have looked at this
question of whether you

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.450
can actually undo the blur.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.670
Deblurring, they
call it, or sometimes

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.020
deconvolution because if
you think of the blurring

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.000
as being a
convolution, you wanted

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.690
to undo that, you want
to do a deconvolution.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.730
So what we actually get
then, in the Fourier domain

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.420
the spectrum of the image
is equal to the spectrum

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.340
of the object multiplied
by some transfer function.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.810
And this would be
true whether it's

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.840
coherent or
incoherent, in general.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.280
They'd be the same
sort of effects,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.230
but you'd have to
work with intensities

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.210
rather than amplitudes.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.950
And so what we say
then is that if we--

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.950
this is the blurred
thing, so we can actually

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.490
blur it by just dividing
by that to get rid of it.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.110
So if we get our
image, we multiply by 1

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.840
over the transfer
function, and that gives us

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.750
our deblurred
version of the image.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:24.100
So as he calls it here, you
can call it inverse filtering,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.910
or sometimes called
deconvolution.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.040
But that is actually--

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.810
probably you all thought
of, that can't work.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.040
It doesn't sound as
like it ought to work.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.300
And of course, it
doesn't work very well.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.050
We're going to show a bit
more about this in a minute.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.720
In particular, it
really goes wrong

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.620
if this thing goes
to 0, obviously.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.100
So you can't know
very much about that.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.440
And then also, if
it goes to something

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.130
which is even very small, you
have to amplify it by a lot.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.839
And when you amplify it, you're
going to amplify the noise.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.900
So you'll end up with
a noisy reconstruction

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.270
after you've done that.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.369
So this sort of
inverse filtering

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:19.660
invariably increases
the noise in the image.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.980
And so how can we
get around that?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:30.160
Well, we just get around
the 0 by making it so

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.300
that there isn't a 0 anymore.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.120
So this is our new version.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.350
You can see that if mu
were 0, this would just

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.890
become the same as before.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.050
This is H times H star, so
the H stars would cancel,

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.030
and this is 1 over H.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.920
So if this is being
compared with that,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.250
then it becomes
the same as before.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:59.050
But if this becomes small,
then we're just left with this,

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:05.830
and it avoids it blowing
up and giving infinity.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.950
So if mu is 0, it reduces
to the direct filter,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.040
and we just described that
that's not a good thing to do.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.650
So the more noise
there is there,

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.920
the bigger you need to
make this to avoid getting

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.350
too much noise in the image.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.640
So as the noise
increases, you would tend

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.500
to increase the value of mu.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:42.330
Yeah, so here it's saying
that if the signal and noise

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.430
both obey particular
type of statistics,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:52.310
then you can find what the
optimum value of mu is.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.570
And we find then
that it's equal to 1

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.650
over the signal-to-noise
ratio, and this

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.200
is what's called a vena filter.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.420
So this N comes down to
be the same as a vena

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.950
filter, which you might have
come across, some of you,

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.850
in other things.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.230
So what we are doing,
really, is you're

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.490
amplifying the spatial
frequencies that

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.540
have been pushed down
by the imaging process.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.220
But if there is if they
become smaller than the noise,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.460
then you don't do that anymore.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.510
So he's going to give
an example of this.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.070
So this is the convolution
using this second

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.370
of regularized inverse filter.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:58.520
And yeah, OK, he's
saying here that he's

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.210
assuming he knows that
depth before he does this.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:08.280
So obviously, that is something
you wouldn't always necessarily

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.190
know.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.700
But he knows the
depth, therefore

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.530
he can calculate what
the transfer function was

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.940
on the imaging side.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.030
And therefore he knows
what filter inverse

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.870
filter to apply in order to
get the best reconstruction.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.170
And you can see that it works
extremely well for this one.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:33.390
This one is slightly blurred,
slightly a bit more blurred.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.940
And you can see also that
the background here--

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.630
or at least, I can
see on this screen,

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.930
but this one doesn't
show very much--

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.157
the background is becoming
not black anymore.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.470
And then this is what
happens if you've

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:56.420
got a noisy image, if you
add noise to the original--

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.780
to the image before you
do the deconvolution.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.690
Now you see that
that actually it's

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.220
not working nearly so well.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.080
And this one here,
you can't really

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.860
make out what there is there.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:14.310
So this is showing that
these methods can work,

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:19.260
but you can see
that there are also

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.240
limits to how well
they can work,

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.140
and especially in the
presence of noise.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.040
Actually, I should
mention that, of course,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.870
at MIT in the Media
Lab, there's a lot

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.050
of work going on in
this area of what

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.380
they call computational
photography, which is all

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:46.390
to do with changing the
properties of the camera

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.560
in order to make it so that
this sort of reconstruction

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.340
is more efficient.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.480
So it turns out that if
you're clever about the design

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.520
of the imaging system,
you can actually

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.440
make it so that this
all works a lot better.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.920
But we weren't going
to go into all that.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.680
Oh, sorry.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.640
I've got this wrong.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.050
This one was the--

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.702
sorry, this was the--

00:22:09.702 --> 00:22:10.660
oh, yeah, that's right.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:16.360
This is the image before you've
done the inverse filtering,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.950
and this is the
image after you've

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.750
done the inverse filtering.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.250
So it's actually
doing quite well.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.090
This one here is pretty well
not very different from that.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:32.320
And this one, as before, is not
as good, but doing pretty well.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.840
Of course if, you didn't know
what the height of these things

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.910
is, then you might have to
use some iterative algorithm

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:51.250
in order to come up with
the best reconstruction.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.350
You can imagine also that--

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.860
so this is for this
so-called 2 and 1/2 D object.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.450
You could imagine an object
which really did have structure

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.390
inside itself, so
maybe these three Ms

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.940
would be on top of each
other and semi-transparent.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.990
And then the trick would
be to try to actually

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:21.270
produce a reconstruction of the
3D object from the 3D image,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.990
and there are actually
computer packages

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.360
that you can get to do just
that very sort of thing.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.250
So that was what we
should have done,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.690
and we'll now go on
to today's lecture.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:43.160
And so today's lecture
is, first of all,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.210
about polarization, which we've
been talking about in the lab

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.070
today--

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.330
or yesterday, wasn't it?

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.660
So that's a bit topical.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:59.950
And then George wrote these.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.910
So the bit that I've
added extra is basically

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.300
addressing these points
here, effects of polarization

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.580
on imaging in a microscope
objective or a lens

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.310
with a high numerical aperture.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.400
So we'll start off
with the polarization.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.900
I'm not sure what he said about
polarization, first of all.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.310
But basically, then,
the wave equation

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.400
for an electromagnetic field
is basically a vector wave

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.470
equation.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:37.390
It's a function of
electric field here.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:41.230
And we had then that
the polarization

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:46.430
is some function of
the electric field

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.600
and how the relationship
between these

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.710
depends on the sort of material.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.010
And so this is giving
some different examples.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.990
The simple case is this one,
which we did look at earlier,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.690
is where the polarization
is proportional

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.790
to the electric field.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:10.340
And you remember that you get
D by adding the P to the E.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:16.220
And so here, this is called
the electric susceptibility,

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.920
and P equals Chi times E.
So if this is a constant,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.840
this is just a linear
relationship, which

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.510
is how we described it before.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.680
But there are two ways that
that can break down in practice.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:36.350
And usually, actually, for
materials where it breaks down,

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.800
it breaks down for both at
the same time, unfortunately.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.360
So it becomes very complicated.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.650
But here we've written it with
these two effects separately.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.580
this.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.980
Is where actually the
relationship is still linear,

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:56.480
but P is related to e
not by a simple scalar

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.610
relationship like this, but
by a tensor relationship.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.630
So the direction of P is
not in the same direction

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.780
as the direction
of E. And so you've

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.130
got this 3 by 3
matrix, which describes

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.680
the properties of the material.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.440
And this will depend on--

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:22.250
well, for a isotopic material,
like a crystal or something

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.180
like that, it would depend
on the crystal structure.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:32.150
Of course, if you've got some
complicated varying objects,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:37.760
then it can be all sorts of
even more complicated things.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.540
So that's the first case.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.260
So this is what's going to
lead to some interesting

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.070
polarization effects as
you put that electric field

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.540
into a crystal, for example.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.510
And then this is
the other one which

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:57.750
is now looking at isotopic
material, but nonlinear.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.810
So this is now no
longer a constant.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.780
And so what that
means, you can you

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.550
could expand it
as a power series.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:10.950
And you can see that there
might be some extra terms here.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.700
This is what's called
the Kerr effect.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:18.590
There's effectively
a susceptibility

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:24.220
which is dependent on the
intensity of the light which

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:24.960
shines on it.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.850
And of course, you
might expect that there

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.380
will be higher orders of
this as well, of course.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.910
These sorts of
effects, you're only

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:43.350
going to excite these if you
have a large value of E. It's

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.110
a bit like, if you imagine
how this all comes about,

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.750
this comes about
because your material

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.400
is made up of atoms which
are all bonded together

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.200
and joined to each
other with springs.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.580
And when you apply
the electric field,

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.400
it makes these atoms
vibrate against the spring.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.670
And if the vibrations
are small, then it's

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.680
all going to
satisfy Hooke's law,

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.430
and it's going to be linear.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.170
But if you increase
the forcing term,

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.100
then the vibrations get bigger,
Hooke's law breaks down,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.190
and the vibrations
become nonlinear.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:26.090
That's the basic physics
of what's going on here.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.530
So this is what's
called the Kerr effect.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.510
There is actually
another effect which

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.370
George hasn't mentioned here.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:37.350
There's another-- you see
this is actually E cubed here.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.150
But you can have an
effect where this

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:45.240
is E squared, which is called
the-- what's it called?

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.130
The Pockels effect.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.140
I was really only asking
because I'd forgotten

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.760
the word for a minute.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.150
But my students here know that
I'm always forgetting names,

00:28:54.150 --> 00:29:00.920
and they usually
come back eventually.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.250
Did you see what that did?

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.930
Oh, yeah, it did
this, the relationship

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:10.235
between the susceptibility
and the refractive index.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.480
And this is saying
that the phase delay

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.240
depends on the polarization.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.300
And in this one, the
index of refraction

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.910
depends on the intensity.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.160
So this is nonlinear optics.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.597
And as I say, those last
two effects very often

00:29:32.597 --> 00:29:33.180
come together.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.090
So this is now talking
about polarization of light.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.210
I think that probably
George must have mentioned

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.210
this to some degree earlier on.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.980
But what this is showing,
then, is a plane wave of light.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.660
It's part linearly polarized
in the x direction--

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.890
sorry, the y direction.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.110
This is taken as y.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.360
So the electric field
is in the y direction,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.700
which actually means that
the magnetic field is going

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.240
to be in the x direction
because they're

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.270
at right angles with each
other, if you remember.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:15.270
And you remember that you can
think of the wave propagating

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.810
in two different ways.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:22.080
One is to think of it other
at a certain instant of time,

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.440
so what we call here
it's a snapshot,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.610
and then we plot what
happens as a function of z.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:34.110
So of course, we have
to do this because it's

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.310
difficult to plot it against
space and time at the same time

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.550
because it's difficult to
visualize what's going on.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.660
So you can see here this
electric field is always

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.770
in the same plane, and
it's a maximum here.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.740
It reduces, it becomes 0.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.890
It then increases in
the negative direction,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.280
comes back to 0 again,
and so on and so on.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:06.170
So this is linearly polarized
light as a function of space.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:11.340
And then this one shows the same
thing as a function of time.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.950
So we're looking at now one
particular value of positions

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.800
that equals 0, and we're
looking at how this

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.410
varies as a function of time.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.120
Exactly the same
diagram, of course.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.080
You probably saw when I
flicked to the next slide,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.280
it didn't change at all.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.225
It just changed the caption.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.560
And this is what circular
polarization does.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.490
Circular polarization, you can
see what this is trying to--

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.000
it looks a bit complicated here.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.950
But what it's really doing is
actually quite straightforward.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.420
It's actually rotating.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.280
This electric vector is
rotating either with distance

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.090
or with time, according to
which way you do the plot.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.310
And the length of this
line stays the same.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.870
So this is what we mean
by circular polarization.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.610
And this is showing
how, actually, you

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.040
can think of
circular polarization

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.150
as being made up
of two components--

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.440
one linearly
polarized in this side

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.850
in the y direction, one linearly
polarized in the x direction.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:30.500
And so you can see that
there are also out of phase

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.040
by 90 degrees.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:39.090
So you can see now that in
this distance, position,

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.050
this is plotted against z again.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.880
Here this one is a
maximum, this one is 0.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.550
So the electric field
is in the x direction.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.010
And then as you go,
as you travel along,

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:53.190
this gets smaller,
but this gets bigger.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.150
So this position here,
the electric field

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.520
is now polarized
in the y direction.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.010
And then this one goes
back down to 0 again,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.620
and this one gets bigger.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.140
So this is exactly
equivalent to the case

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.350
that I showed before, the
circular polarized case.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.730
I might add that
electrical polarization

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:22.020
is where the amplitude of this
component and this component

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.590
are not equal.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.888
So if that was the
case, it would-- again,

00:33:26.888 --> 00:33:28.680
you that you'd think
of this electric field

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.280
vector as rotating, but
the length of the vector

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.860
would also change as it rotates.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.260
And of course, you
can have two cases.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.780
You can have it
rotating clockwise,

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.880
or you can have it
rotating anti-clockwise.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.410
So these are called
left- and right-hand

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.850
circular polarization.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:55.100
So this is showing
an end-on view.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.080
So this is x and y.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.920
So this thing is pointing
out towards you, isn't it,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.480
that means.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.850
No, it means it's
going away, isn't it?

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.050
But is it right?

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.540
Because it's left-handed
coordinate system.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.870
If that's the case because x--

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.199
oh, no, it's not.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:21.960
No, it's right.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.650
It's right.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.050
It's the right-handed
coordinate system.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.670
Yeah, x cross y
goes away from you.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.940
And so this is
showing, then, end-on,

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.489
what happens to this
electric vector.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:37.590
And the wonders
of modern science

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.340
have in fact changed the
circular polarization

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.690
to electrical polarization
without me doing anything.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.860
Now, so next is to
introduce some--

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.179
sorry.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.530
I missed that one.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:01.960
There were lots of these things
that my computer misinterpreted

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.180
from George's computer.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.030
And I changed most of them,
but I missed one there.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.960
That should say left
lambda over 4 plate.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.020
I don't know what the difference
is what he put in there.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.310
Do you know what he's put in
there to make it go like that?

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.440
Anyway, he did this on his Mac.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.503
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:21.503 --> 00:35:22.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.540
Yeah, but it's a
funny font as well.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.700
Anyway, so this is
showing what would happen

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.590
if you put some birefringent--

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.830
a special birefringent
material here,

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.550
which is what's called
a lambda by 4 plate.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:45.310
And what this does is it
changes the relative phase

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.770
of the components of electric
field in two directions

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:57.850
by a different amount as it
transmits through the crystal.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:02.740
And so if you arrange
the orientation of it

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.810
correctly relative
to the light, it

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.650
has this effect of changing
the linear polarization

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.980
into circular polarization.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.400
The way it really does
that is that this--

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.380
you would say that
this you can think

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.760
of as being made up of two
linearly polarized components,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.190
and this you can always
think of as being made up

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.650
of two linearly
polarized components

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:30.180
as well at 45 degrees to that.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.460
So you just resolve that
into two components.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.850
So the circular
polarized, you get that

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.380
very simply by just changing
the relative phase of those two

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.510
linear polarized components.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.600
That's how it works, but I
think here he's just trying

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.530
to show you what it does.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:55.050
And then the other
important device

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:59.820
that people use is a
is a lambda by 2 plate

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.480
rather than a lambda
by 4 plate, and that

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:10.080
has the property of changing x
polarized, linearly polarized

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.560
light into y polarized light.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.530
And again, you can see
how this is working

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:20.580
by thinking in terms of
resolving this in so two

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.010
components at 45 degrees
to it, and then changing

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.420
the relative sign.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.200
Maybe I should do that.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.420
This doesn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.190
Is it switched on?

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.610
PROFESSOR: So maybe I
can just do that quickly.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.480
So what I'm saying is that
this, you can think of it--

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.845
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.980
PROFESSOR: This
one you can think

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.320
of as being resolved into
these two components.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.590
And then the crystal
is then changing

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.110
the relative phase of
one of these relative

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.130
to that, making that.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.825
And so now the
polarization is like this.

00:38:00.825 --> 00:38:01.950
So that's how it's working.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:06.600
For the lambda by 4 plate,
what it was doing was

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.010
it was changing the relative
phase of this and this

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.380
by 90 degrees, not by 180
degrees, which would give you

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.760
a circularly polarized light.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.720
But in order to get
this effect, you

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.520
have to get the right
orientation of the polarization

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.960
relative to the crystal axes.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.340
So that part he hasn't actually
said anything about here.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.120
The other thing-- maybe you'd
be interested to know this.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.230
Of course, if you put linearly
polarized light in and get

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.660
circularly polarized
light out, what

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.440
would happen if you
went the other way?

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.490
Well, in fact, it does
work the other way.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.070
You can put it in
circularly polarized light

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.050
and get out linearly
polarized light.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:01.690
So you can do either
of those two things.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.510
The other thing that
you might worry about

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:17.400
is it's interesting that if we
change the phase of this light,

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.840
then it's going to change the
phase of that light, isn't it?

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:28.910
And yeah, maybe that's
not leading anywhere.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.210
I won't say any more about.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.830
OK, think about this.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.330
Yeah.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.650
Oh, well, there we are.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.860
I've already-- I've
jumped the gun a bit.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.120
So he's saying, what
happens here then?

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.530
So we've got incoming linearly
polarized light, the lambda

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:49.400
by 4 plate.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.770
What does the lambda
by 4 plate do?

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:54.190
Circular polarized.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.980
So we've got circular
polarized light on here.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.640
It strikes a mirror
and it reflects.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.310
What do we get after
it's reflected?

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.420
That's a bit hard now, isn't it?

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.750
Opposite circular, right.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.670
And then this gets back
to here and it goes back

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:15.360
through this birefringent plate.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.470
So what does it do?

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.300
AUDIENCE: Same.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.600
PROFESSOR: Same polarization.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.190
Is that right?

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.158
It rotates by 180 degrees.

00:40:25.158 --> 00:40:26.200
This is slower, actually.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.760
It's gone through a lambda
by 2 plate then, isn't it?

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.840
Well, I mean--

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.298
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:40.977 --> 00:40:41.810
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:42.310
Yeah, sorry.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.352
Yeah, you're quite right.

00:40:43.352 --> 00:40:43.960
Yeah.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.460
Yeah.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.670
OK everyone, about that?

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.560
I guess the next
thing is to say what

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.310
would happen if you change that
mirror by a phase conjugate

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:53.810
mirror.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:59.710
But maybe that's too difficult
for us to think about.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:03.640
And then remember that--

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.800
I think we had this
before as well--

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.760
that when you have
lights interfering,

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.960
the electric field, it's
only the parallel components

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.880
of electric field
that interfere.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:20.560
So if you've got two waves
where the electric fields are

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.310
at right angles to each other,
then they don't interfere.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.210
So this is showing
this case here.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.230
We've got two plane
polarized waves.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.590
They're polarized at right
angles to each other,

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.890
and so they won't interfere.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.602
And therefore, if you
look at the trying

00:41:38.602 --> 00:41:40.060
to get an interference
pattern, you

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.393
won't see anything in this case.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:48.080
And this is showing
them in the same plane.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.430
And then they would interfere
, and you would get some

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:56.840
interference pattern with
maxima a minima like this.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.590
Another interesting one I
guess I might draw over here

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.600
is what happens if you--

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.790
this is our screen.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.450
And let's say we've got
two waves coming in.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:13.190
One, let's say, is
polarized like this,

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:18.190
and the other one
is coming in here

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.660
and it's polarized like this.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.160
You see?

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.070
So we've got these
two waves coming in.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.030
And you can see that their
electric field vectors are

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.520
at right angles to
each other, and so this

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.620
is another example where
they're not going to interfere.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.890
So you wouldn't see any
interference fringes

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.120
in this case.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.900
So this corresponds to
what's called p-polarization.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.020
So if we did this the
opposite, if we did it

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:53.760
with the electric field in this
direction, and the other one's

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.900
coming in also with the actually
field in this direction,

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.720
then you can see these are
now in parallel directions.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.710
and so you would see fringes
where these two plane

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:09.930
waves interfere.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.980
So I've drawn this for
the particular case.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.710
This is supposed
to be 90 degrees.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.440
Right, OK.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.000
That's all George's material.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.440
That was the end of George.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:34.930
It didn't end with a
particularly startling thing.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:43.920
So that's really the end of
the course as George wrote it.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.530
But he did ask me, as I
say, to do a bit more.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.920
So what I think I'll do,
why don't we have a break

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.960
now for five minutes?

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.232
And then I'll start again
in five minutes' time.

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:56.940
So this is-- now it's
going to be talking

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.430
about focusing of light.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.940
And as I said before, this
material I'm going to do now

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.010
is just for interest.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.770
It's not going to be examinable.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.810
And if you're not
interested, you

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.580
can go and have a cup
of coffee instead.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.840
I don't really mind.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.960
But some people might be
interested in learning

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.940
a bit more about
focusing of light.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:31.350
So I was going to say a bit
more about focusing of light,

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.680
and in particular some of the
funny things that happen when

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.960
you look at focusing of light
with a microscope objective,

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.870
so the tight focusing of light.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.880
And this is actually a
picture of the intensity

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:55.410
in the focal region of a lens,
not high numerical aperture

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:55.980
in this case.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.170
This is according
to paraxial optics.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.350
This is a picture taken
from [INAUDIBLE] Wolf.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:06.660
And it's similar but
not identical to the one

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:13.770
that George showed on the last
lecture or the lecture before.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:16.510
So this is the focal plane.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.392
This is the optic axis.

00:45:18.392 --> 00:45:20.100
And of course, what
you're really seeing,

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.820
this is actually going
to be radially symmetric.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:29.490
So if you imagine this was
being revolved around the axis,

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.240
you'd have the shape of
this complete surface.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.300
And you can see what
happens is so this

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.380
is the focal plane where
you got the Airy disk.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.170
And then as you go
out of focus, then you

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:48.750
start getting this
strange sort of almost

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.310
like a sort of butterfly shape.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.090
So this calculation that's
given in [INAUDIBLE] Wolf,

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.030
it first of all,
as I've said, it's

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.430
using this small
angle approximation.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.720
You assume that sine theta
is the same as theta.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.460
And it also makes an assumption,
which is called the Debye

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.820
approximation.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.780
So I'll say a bit more about
the Debye approximation.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.360
But before I carry on,
I'll say another thing.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.680
I'd forgotten I'd put this in.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.140
And that is that there was a
really neat paper published

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:36.410
way back in 1964 by
McCutcheon, where

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:42.350
he showed that you can postulate
the idea, the concept of what

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:45.050
he calls the 3D pupil.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:49.730
And this is the cap
of a sphere where

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:54.290
it's cut off at this angle
alpha, the angle of the lens.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:59.290
And if you do love the 3D
Fourier transform of this--

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:03.430
ta-da-- you get back to that.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.290
So isn't that neat?

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:11.470
So I guess, if you think a bit
more about it, it's probably--

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:15.700
I think you can satisfy yourself
that perhaps it's right.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.700
This is in k space,
effectively, then.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:25.540
And what it's really saying
is that because the light

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:31.000
satisfies the wave equation,
the modulus of k is constant,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.990
and therefore the locus of
this is a sphere of radius k,

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.300
so very simple.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:48.240
So light propagating-- this
convergent light propagating

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.080
will have a k vector which lies
on the surface of this sphere.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.750
So I just added that just
because I thought people

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.790
might find it a bit intriguing.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:04.050
You can sort of generalize
a lot of imaging theory

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.910
into 3D using this
same sort of approach.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.810
But I'm not going to say
anything more about that now.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:14.010
What I'm going to do
now is talk about--

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.800
so this is this Debye
approximation again.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.160
You remember, we said there's
two ways of calculating

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.370
to two different
optical systems, which

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.610
give virtually the same or
similar sort of results.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:28.470
This one I'll look
at first of all.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.570
This is where you
got the aperture stop

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.920
in the front focal
plane of the lens.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.350
This is a distance f.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:35.880
This is a distance f.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.350
And then in this plane here,
you will get the Airy disk.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:44.100
So the pattern I described
a couple of slides

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:50.530
ago for the field is in 3D space
would be in this region here.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.510
So in this plane here, you
get Fraunhofer diffraction,

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:59.430
and then in the regions around
it you get Fresnel diffraction.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:03.570
But you can get quite similar
results, if you remember,

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.980
by using this sort of system.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.420
So this is where
the aperture stop

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.200
is not actually in the front
focal plane of the lens, but it

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.210
actually in the
plane of the lens.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.960
Or you could think another way
of doing this experiment would

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:23.520
be to get a convergent beam
and place a circular aperture

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.110
in that convergent beam.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.540
So the question is, what do
you get in the focal region

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.190
in that case?

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:37.950
And it turns out that if
you satisfy this condition,

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:43.080
that a squared over lambda
z is very large, where

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.040
is a is this radius here--

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.590
this is called the
Fresnel number.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:55.000
And if that quantity
is very large,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.490
it means that what you'll
get in this focal region

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.080
is very similar to this.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.900
Actually, there's a
parabolic phase term

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.010
that we described when
we did the Fourier

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.220
optics that makes it different.

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.510
But the intensity is going to be
the same as for this case here.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.670
So these are two
cases where you can

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:18.040
get this Debye approximation.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.280
So in this case, it's exact
for this particular geometry.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.440
In this case, it's
an approximation

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.320
which is obeyed if this
Fresnel number is very large.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:36.540
And then, not that
long ago, people

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:41.050
realized that this
was an approximation,

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.200
an assumption that was made.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:49.410
And there was a very nice
paper published by Li and Wolf,

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:50.770
so this paper here--

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:57.780
1984, quite a long time ago now,
but not that long, but anyway,

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.810
as history goes, Li and Wolf.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.420
And they showed
what would happen

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.030
if this Fresnel
number was not large

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.640
but was of some
intermediate value.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.065
In this case, N equals 10.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:17.830
So you see what happens is that
this pattern has got distorted.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.190
You can see that it's
tending to sort of fan out.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:25.150
And the physical
explanation of that

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.850
is that, effectively,
the light is

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.790
being distracted by the
aperture and spreading

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:34.300
because of diffraction effects.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.690
And that is superimposed
on the focusing effect.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.900
So the lens is trying
to focus the light down,

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:45.080
and the diffraction is tending
to focus the light out.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:50.860
And so you get a sort of balance
between these two things.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:57.740
So in this focal plane here,
you get the same intensity

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:02.250
as you would if the Debye
approximation was valid.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:05.940
But in the region elsewhere,
it's a bit different.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:11.952
It's scaled according to some
sort of affine transformation,

00:52:11.952 --> 00:52:13.160
I think it probably would be.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.080
What do you think?

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.320
What do you think, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.700
But one very interesting
thing that happens

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.380
is that it turns
out-- you can't really

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.300
see it very well
from this diagram,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:32.360
but the maximum intensity is no
longer in the focal plane, no

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.210
longer in the
geometrical focal plane.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.700
It's shifted towards
the aperture.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.670
And that is called the
focus shift effect,

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.800
and there's been a
lot of papers that

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.210
have been concerned with that
and calculating what happens

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.760
for lots of different cases.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.740
So that's the Debye
approximation.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.370
That shows what happens
if it isn't true.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.530
But now I'm going to go back.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.750
And all the rest I'm
going to carry on now

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.810
is talking about what happens
if the paraxial approximation

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:08.960
breaks down, but the Debye
approximation is valid.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.520
The case when the Debye
approximation is not valid

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.270
and it's a high numerical
aperture is very complicated,

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:18.890
and there have been
very few papers

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:20.900
that I've treated that case.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.390
Anyway, tight focusing of light.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:27.540
We get light, we put it
into a microscope objective.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.680
The light then-- a
microscope objective,

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:35.570
a dry microscope objective
might have a numerical aperture

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:41.060
of 0.95, which means that the
light is converging something

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.080
maybe over 70 degrees relative
to the axis, so very--

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.020
you can't really think of 70
degrees as being a small angle,

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.460
I guess.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.810
So the normal paraxial
approximations break down.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:57.300
And this is some sort of areas
where we might want to do this.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.920
The one, of course, that I'm
most interested in, microscopy,

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:06.320
but also laser micromachining,
optical data storage,

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:11.360
optical lithography, laser
trapping and cooling, looking

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.630
at the physics of
light-atom interactions,

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.850
and cavity quantum
electrodynamics.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.220
So there's a lot
of basic physics

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:25.190
that's being done nowadays that
uses these sort of principles,

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.370
too.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.410
So this is how we
model the light.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.050
Again, we've got--
just like before,

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.240
we think of the
aperture as being

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.720
placed in the front
focal plane of the lens.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.620
Of course, the lens
is very complicated.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.070
It's got loads of
pieces of glass in.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:46.970
But we think of it just
as like a black box,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:51.440
and we describe it just
by this surface here,

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.320
which is called the
equivalent refractive locus.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.100
And what that is, is
the locus of points

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.980
where this ray and
this ray intersect.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:08.870
And actually, if you've got
a well-designed system that

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:12.410
is satisfies what's
called the sine condition,

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.088
this surface will be a sphere.

00:55:15.088 --> 00:55:17.130
But I'm not going to go
into the details of that.

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:22.230
I'm just going to assume it's
a sphere in what comes next.

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:25.550
So in this case,
you've effectively

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:30.380
got lots of plane waves
incident in the focus.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:34.940
But unlike the paraxial
case, we really

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.580
have to take into account
now the polarization

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.750
of these electric fields and
add together the electric fields

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:43.580
in the focal region.

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:47.570
And so this is what
happens after the light's

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:50.660
gone through the lens.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.140
It starts off as
being plane polarized.

00:55:54.140 --> 00:56:01.080
So in my diagram here the red
represents the electric field,

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.760
say.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.490
So we start off with
the electric field

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:08.210
being plane polarized in
the vertical direction.

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:10.990
And then after it's
gone through the lens,

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:17.510
the rays are focused on
the focal point, which is

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:19.700
at the center of this sphere.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.280
But if you actually
calculate what

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.720
happens to the electric field
vector, this is what it does.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.510
After you've focused
it, the electric field

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:33.500
lies on the surface of the
sphere with this geometry

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.170
that-- you see that
these lines all

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:40.460
go through a point on the
far side of the sphere.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:45.080
And the same is true for
the magnetic field as well.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.470
If you calculate what happens,
this is what you find happens.

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:54.980
And you can show that this is
actually exactly the same field

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:58.220
as you would get if you
placed at the center

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.670
an electric dipole
along this axis

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:05.010
and a magnetic dipole
along the y-axis.

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:09.280
So if you add together those
fields, you would get this.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.900
And one more thing
to say is, you

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:19.360
can see that if you've got a
small aperture system, low NA,

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.010
you're in this region here.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.500
And you can see now it's
becoming very close to being

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.060
linearly polarized again.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.460
It's only when you
get to big angles

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:32.550
that it starts becoming
a bit more complicated.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:37.410
So Richards and Wolf in 1959--

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:42.110
so this is the same Emil
Wolf who wrote the book.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:46.160
And in their paper--

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.020
I haven't got the
reference here, I'm sorry.

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:52.722
But anyone remember what
it was published in?

00:57:52.722 --> 00:57:54.300
I've forgotten.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.140
No, it doesn't matter.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.890
Proceedings of the Physical
Society, I think, maybe.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.140
But anyway, it doesn't matter.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.710
You can easily find it on
the web if you're after it.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.792
They showed-- you found it?

00:58:08.792 --> 00:58:10.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.800
PROFESSOR: OK, Proceedings
of the Royal Society

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.290
of London in 1959.

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:19.220
They showed that the
field in the focal region

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.840
could be written in this form.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.960
So rather than just have
one diffraction integral,

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:28.190
we now end up with
three for the three--

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.590
defining these three integrals.

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.650
And then these are
the electric fields

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:37.390
in the focal region, written
in terms of these integrals--

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.110
i0, i1, and i2.

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:44.100
And these things are very
similar to the paraxial things.

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:49.400
The normal paraxial one is a bit
similar to this, with the j0.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.300
And this is an extra
bit which comes about

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:59.190
because of the system
satisfying the sine condition.

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:02.150
And I'll draw it for
you, what's happening.

00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:06.650
Basically, if this is this
aplanatic sphere surface,

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:12.860
if you put in light,
plane polarized light,

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:16.190
into this system,
you can see, if this

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:20.690
is uniform intensity
when it goes in,

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:24.950
you can see that the amount of
energy that's gone into here

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:29.100
and the amount of energy that's
going to go into this angle,

00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:32.000
which is very much bigger,
is going to be the same.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.210
So you see what I'm saying?

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.620
So this amount of
energy is going

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:39.650
to be squeezed into this angle,
whereas this amount of energy

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:43.350
is going to be spread
out over this angle.

00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:48.560
So this produces
this factor here.

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:56.220
And then you can
calculate what happens.

00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.300
So this is-- yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.394
You see, you write things
like that not so ti

01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:03.405
can be symmetric.

01:00:03.405 --> 01:00:07.530
But of course, what I
mean is that this is not

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.120
circularly symmetric.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.730
This really should be a circle
before the modern technology

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:17.030
distorted it.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.240
And so rather than the normal
Airy disk, what you get

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.370
is this elliptical
focal spot like this.

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:33.540
And this is another calculation.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.630
These are both from a
couple of my papers.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:42.830
This one is a really old
paper, 1977, really old.

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:47.270
And this one was from a
bit more recent, 1997.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.290
So this was written
with Peter Torok.

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:53.930
And we came up here with a
new way of calculating it

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:59.030
where, basically, we look
at the multimodal expansion

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:03.110
of the field over the
sphere and express it

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:06.740
as a sum of these
spherical harmonics,

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.750
the modes of the sphere.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:13.550
And so this becomes a very
actually quite computationally

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:15.620
efficient way of
calculating things.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.540
And this is for
two systems, then.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:23.790
This is for an angle of
pi by 3, so 60 degrees,

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:26.030
and this is for 90 degrees.

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:30.080
So this is if you're actually
the limiting case, when

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.670
you're actually focusing a
whole hemisphere of light

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.840
onto the focus.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.530
And you can see that the
sort of general shape

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:41.440
stays much the same,
but it changes a bit

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.923
as you change the aperture.

01:01:44.923 --> 01:01:46.840
The other thing I was
going to say a bit about

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.390
is Bessel beams.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:52.960
I don't think George did
anything about Bessel beams

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.770
in the end, but I did
see it as a title on some

01:01:56.770 --> 01:02:00.910
on the contents of
some of the lectures,

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.410
as though it was
just about to come.

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:05.140
But maybe I just missed it.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.600
But anyway, this
is a concept that

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:13.780
is quite interesting
at the moment.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.440
Basically, there are three ways
I'm showing here of doing it.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:23.720
One is what happens
if you put in your--

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.960
this is the aperture
stop of this lens,

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.920
and we've put this central
obstruction so that it becomes

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.600
just that annular region.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.050
And we make the width of this
annulus very, very narrow.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.170
Then, you remember, just
in the last lecture,

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:43.550
we looked at what happens
for this annular lens.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:46.220
And we know that
what happens is,

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.960
compared with the Airy disk,
the central lobe gets narrower,

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.040
but the side lobes get bigger.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.670
Well, it turns out that
in the limiting cases,

01:02:55.670 --> 01:03:01.520
this becomes very narrow, you
get the Airy disk becomes,

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.240
given by this very simple
expression, just j0 squared,

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.310
where j0 is a Bessel function.

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:12.130
So that's why it's
called a Bessel beam.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:17.390
And it has this
very nice property

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:22.460
that actually this is it this
satisfies the wave equation.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.290
So it's like a sort
of mode of free space.

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:30.440
So this Bessel beam propagates
with an infinite depth

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.240
of focus.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.850
It just propagates
without spreading,

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.960
and so that's why
these beams have become

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.160
of quite a lot of interest.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.910
Actually, the concept
is really quite old.

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:48.980
There was a device
proposed by MacLeod in 1954

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.380
for producing something
rather similar,

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.990
which is called the Axicon.

01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:57.960
An Axicon is like a
conical piece of glass.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.840
It's like a conical prism.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.260
And you can see, then,
that a prism refracts

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.350
the light parallel, like this.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:09.620
And so you can see wherever
you are along this axis

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.140
you can see that
what you see is light

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.880
that's coming at the
same angle, and so you

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.800
can see from this how you get
this increased depth of focus

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.210
of this system.

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:27.110
And another system was proposed,
again, a long time ago,

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:31.100
by Dyson, to do this
not with a prism

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.740
but with a diffractive
optical structure.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.810
So you make a sort
of grating, which

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:40.190
is a bit like a zone plate
except the zone plate--

01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:44.900
the rings on a zone plate
go as R squared, whereas--

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.410
sorry, the width of them,
the spacing goes as 1 over R

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:54.110
squared, whereas this one,
the rings are linearly spaced.

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:59.390
And in this case, because the
grating is linearly spaced,

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:01.760
all these rays go
at the same angle,

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.260
and you get the
same effect as this.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.720
So that's how you
make Bessel beams.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.870
So I've been interested in
them for a very long time.

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:18.590
And this is from another paper
of mine going back to 1978,

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:21.140
very long time ago.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.290
And this here was one of
the lines of that paper,

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:25.160
as it says.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.690
"A wave with zero-order Bessel
function radial distribution

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:32.770
propagates without change."

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.230
And so what this
is showing is what

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.780
happens if you,
instead of thinking

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:43.490
of the paraxial theory, what
happens to this Bessel beam

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:48.000
if it's not a paraxial
case, if you put, say,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.410
this annular mask in front
of a high numerical aperture

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:55.910
objective lens.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.960
And this is what you get.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.690
So this is for
different angles--

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.780
30, 60, 90, as before.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.130
I've even gone further here.

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.880
I've gone to 120.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.660
And you might wonder what
that could possibly mean,

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.260
except it means you can
see that you could do it

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:17.840
by using a mirror, the parabolic
mirror that George spoke

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.340
about spoke about earlier.

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:26.340
So you can have light
coming in this way,

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.410
say, a narrow annular
beam coming in here,

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:32.340
so this might correspond,
say, to this case.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:37.920
And then the 120 case would
be when the light's coming in

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.540
like this.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.780
So you can actually get
a bigger than 90 degrees

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.110
by using a mirror
sort of structure.

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:50.950
But anyway, what you
see is what happens,

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:54.680
if the angle of the
focusing is small,

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.250
then it's pretty similar
to what I showed earlier

01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:00.520
for the full lens,
full aperture.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.890
But as you make this
angle bigger and bigger,

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:05.920
eventually very nasty
things start happening.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.480
This thing starts splitting
into two spots rather than one,

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.580
and you can see that it
does more and more of that

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.220
as you make it even bigger.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.620
And so this is all
assuming that we're

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.600
putting plane polarized
light into the lens.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.980
So the conclusion we come so
is that putting plane polarized

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.500
light into that
lens is not really

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.770
a good idea, not good news.

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:36.610
And so this is explaining
things a bit more.

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.660
First of all, we look
at the black curves.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.490
So these correspond, then-- so
a normal Airy disk is this one,

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:48.700
and this other one
here corresponds

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.590
to the narrow annulus.

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:52.690
So you can see this
is the Bessel beam.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:54.850
You can see it
sharpened up quite

01:07:54.850 --> 01:08:00.760
considerably but with some
rather larger side lobes.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:05.430
But then if you go
to the high NA case--

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:09.390
so this is calculating it for
a numerical aperture of 1.4,

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:12.480
so for an [INAUDIBLE]
immersion objective.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.050
And you'll find that
for the annulus now,

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:20.470
it's actually no narrower
than for the full lens.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:26.580
So the polarization effects
are really basically getting

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:31.680
rid of any advantage in
this sharpening of the spot

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.720
that we get in this case.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.600
But it turns out there is a
way of getting round that,

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.149
and that is to not use plane
polarized light going in.

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:45.359
And what we use
instead is putting

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.640
radially polarized light.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.050
If we put in radially
polarized light--

01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:56.670
this corresponds to
this magenta color,

01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.260
so as it says here, radial.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:03.550
I've also called it here
TM0 because it corresponds

01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:06.910
to a transverse magnetic mode.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.029
I'll show you how that
comes about in a minute.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:12.840
And now you can
see for that case

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.330
we're back again to
getting something

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:19.470
very close to what you would
get for the paraxial case.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.680
So there's been a
number of papers

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:28.260
which have exploited using
radially polarized input

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:33.330
into your lens in order to
get a smaller focal spot.

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:35.370
So yeah, this is
how it comes about,

01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:38.010
why it's called
transverse magnetic.

01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:43.590
So this is radially
polarized light.

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:46.420
Sorry, yeah, the red
is the electric field.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.439
So that's in the
radial direction.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.060
If we had a small
NA, it would just

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.979
be still radially polarized.

01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:58.470
But you can see that if you
look on the complete sphere,

01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:05.860
it starts becoming like
lines of longitude--

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.500
latitude on the sphere.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.270
And you see the magnetic
field are these lines, which

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:15.730
are purely transverse,
so that's why

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:18.400
we call it transverse magnetic.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.600
And the 0 corresponds to the
fact it's the lowest order

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.510
mode that's like that.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:30.298
There is another case which
is azimuthal polarization.

01:10:30.298 --> 01:10:31.840
This is where the
electric field goes

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.540
like this and the magnetic
field is like this.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.260
So this corresponds
to TE, but I'm not

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.500
going to say anything more
about that because that doesn't

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.715
produce anything useful.

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:50.340
And this is-- actually, I
said there were three ways

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.840
of making these Bessel beams.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:59.160
There's actually a fourth way,
which some people together

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.720
with me at the Data Storage
Institute here in Singapore

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.120
have been working
on, and this is

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.710
to use a lens with some sort
of binary optic structure.

01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:12.540
And actually, this
was from a paper

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.930
where we were
simulating what happens

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:20.580
if you put radially polarized
light into this sort of system

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.970
and you optimize this
binary mask in order

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:26.250
to get close to a Bessel beam.

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.260
And these are the sort
of results you get.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.050
This is along the axis you
can see that you get something

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:34.800
which really propagates
without spreading over

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.745
quite a long distance.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:50.250
This is showing how there are
various ways of specifying how

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:53.280
the performance of
a focusing system.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:59.880
And one way is to calculate
or measure the electric field

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.540
at the focal point for a given
amount of power going in.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.690
And what you want, of course,
is for the power of the focus

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.860
to be--

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.960
the electric field at the
focus to be as big as possible.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.430
And so this ratio is
this thing called F here.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:20.580
And what this is showing is
that this one here is actually

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.930
for our plane polarized light
going in and showing what

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:28.170
happens to this
ratio as you increase

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:30.280
the aperture of the lens.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.340
And so you can see
that as you increase

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.160
the aperture of the
lens, so, of course,

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.470
it focuses better and better.

01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:39.330
And therefore for the
same amount of power

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:43.110
get getting going in, you get
a higher field at the focus.

01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.870
So that's why it
rises like this.

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:50.130
But it, you see, only
gets to eventually--

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.920
the maximum it ever
gets to is a half.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.730
And the reason it gets
to a half is because--

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.220
I showed that this
polarization is actually

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:04.830
equivalent to an electric
dipole plus a magnetic dipole.

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:11.830
And so only half of the power is
going into the electric dipole,

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:14.490
and it's the electric dipole
that gives an electric field

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.420
at the center.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.150
The magnetic dipole
gives a magnetic field

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.930
at the center,
which we don't want.

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:23.400
So only half of the power is
going into the right thing.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.620
So that's why that does that.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.250
And then you can see there
another two curves here.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:32.980
This one is our radially
polarized light.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.970
So you can see that it's very
slow to get started here,

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:41.560
and that's because with the
radial polarized distribution,

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.680
you've got very little
power near the axis anyway.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.100
So it eventually
starts taking off,

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.230
and you see that
at some angle here,

01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:53.090
which is really quite big--

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:55.690
so this is 90 degrees
down here somewhere,

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:58.510
so this is going to be maybe
80 degrees or something

01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:59.290
like that--

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:03.690
it overtakes the plane polarized
one and becomes better.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.660
But you can see
there's another one,

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:10.660
another curve here,
which is for just

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.810
an electric dipole
on its own, so

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:16.060
a transverse electric dipole.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.600
So rather than try
and give this field,

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.150
we just might try to
get this polarization.

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:26.090
And if we do that, then
we see we do even better.

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:28.810
So in this region here, you
can see this is doing better

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.120
than either of these other two.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.740
So this is what we call
an electric dipole wave.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.600
And this is what this
looks like, then.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.610
This mixed dipole,
which is the electric

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:45.050
plus a magnetic dipole, is
equal to an electric dipole

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:47.360
plus a magnetic dipole.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.820
So this is the
electric dipole field.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.820
So what we need to
do is to make it

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.070
so that after we
focus the light,

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:57.620
the electric field
of the focused light

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:01.160
is on the surface along these
lines, like this, basically.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.940
You see that if you look in
the region near the axis,

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.750
all these behave the same.

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.210
They're all we're all going
to be virtually linearly

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:08.930
polarized.

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:11.750
It's only when you
get so big apertures

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:14.260
that these become different.

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:24.275
And so this is now looking at
what happens with Bessel beams.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.890
So this the so-called
mixed dipole,

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:33.890
which is the plain
polarization case,

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:42.800
for 30 degrees, 60 degrees,
90 degrees 150 degrees.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:48.790
This is for the electric dipole
case, 30 degrees, 60 degrees.

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:54.030
Now, you see here this is
a bit better than this one.

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:58.200
And this one, this spot
is divided into two,

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.450
but this one hasn't
divided into two.

01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:03.200
But it has got these
rather large side

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.350
lobes developed here.

01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:10.350
And then if you look at this
other curve, these other ones

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.020
here, this is what I call a T1.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.450
So this is another mode I
haven't mentioned before.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:21.240
It's another TE mode, but it's
the TE1 rather than the TE0.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.950
And you can see
this one-- actually,

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.450
ti's the same in
all these diagrams.

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:26.880
It's independent
of the angle now.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.400
So you can see, actually,
this one turns out

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.260
to be slightly smaller
than this one even.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:37.180
And this shows what
the TE1 looks like.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.280
This is TE1.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.770
So again, the electric
field is transverse.

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.710
But it's not going all
the way around like TE0.

01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:50.860
It's going this way on this
side and this way on this side.

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.680
So if you could make
this polarization,

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.360
this would produce that results
I've just described there.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.210
So this shows all
these different types.

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:05.580
So what do you have to put
into the lens to get that?

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.410
So this is what you have
to put into the lens.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:12.120
So if you put it in
plane polarized light,

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.260
you get this what I call
the mixed dipole case.

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:19.680
In order to get electric
dipole polarization out,

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.290
you have to put in light
that looks like this.

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:25.740
For the magnetic dipole,
it has to look like this.

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.220
See, here it's going--

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:30.580
it's pointing in, and
here it's pointing out.

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:35.970
And for the TE1,
it's like azimuthal.

01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:40.380
And for the TM1, it's
radial, like this.

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.630
So by altering the
polarization of the light that

01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:46.015
goes into the lens,
you can generate all

01:17:46.015 --> 01:17:47.265
these different mode patterns.

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.010
And this is what it does.

01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:55.250
This is calculating the
area of the focal spot

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:59.310
as a function of angle for
all of these different cases.

01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:02.870
So here there's a
whole range of them

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:06.170
for a full lens, full
circular aperture.

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:10.850
And this is for a few different
cases for the Bessel beam.

01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.640
And you can see what happens is
we want this area, of course,

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.600
to be as small as possible.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.440
And you can see that
actually in this region

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.530
here, the electric dipole
one is the smallest,

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.840
and then the TE1
is the smallest,

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.890
and then eventually the radial
one becomes the smallest.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:30.740
But this doesn't
become bigger until you

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:35.230
get over a numerical
aperture of 0.89.

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:38.260
And then this is for
the full circular case.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.960
I've got lots of
different cases here.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.290
This one corresponds
to a paraboloid mirror.

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:48.070
This one corresponds
to basically

01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:54.130
a different apertization of
the light, which you can see it

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:57.970
actually is doing better
here than the others,

01:18:57.970 --> 01:19:01.690
but eventually runs out of steam
when you get to big angles.

01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:05.770
And you can see here, the
TE case is the smallest,

01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:07.920
and then eventually
the radial case

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.770
is the smallest after you get
above a numerical aperture

01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:16.158
0.91.

01:19:16.158 --> 01:19:17.950
Now, the other thing
you'll notice, though,

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.470
about all those
spots I was showing

01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:22.240
is they're all not symmetrical.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.180
So what can we do to
make them symmetrical?

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:30.220
Well, this fits in a bit with
what we were talking about

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:34.000
before, the polarization case,
the circularly polarized.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.670
The TE and the TM0 are
already circularly symmetric,

01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:41.080
rotationally symmetric.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.350
This one corresponds to our
normal radial polarization.

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:47.140
But these are the
ones, we know that x

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:52.330
polarized plus iy polarized
equals circular polarized.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:55.150
So we can do similar
sorts of things

01:19:55.150 --> 01:20:00.880
with these TEs or the
electric dipole polarizations.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.170
We can add we can add one
of them along the x with one

01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:08.120
of them along the
y with an i there,

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.630
and that actually is now
going to give something which

01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:13.090
is rotationally symmetric.

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:15.610
And it actually, if you
think a lot more about it,

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:20.620
it corresponds to
azimuthal polarization

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.680
with a phase singularity,
with a vortex, a phase

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.620
vortex superimposed on it.

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.210
And this one corresponds to
some elliptical polarization

01:20:31.210 --> 01:20:33.580
with a phase singularity.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.960
So what I mean by this?

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:40.680
This one, azimuthal polarization
with a phase singularity,

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:50.360
what I mean by that is
at anywhere around here,

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.320
it's polarized in the
azimuthal direction.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.530
But as you go round
here, the phase

01:20:57.530 --> 01:21:01.595
changes from 0 right
around to 2 pi.

01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:06.080
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:06.630
No?

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:07.780
OK.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.480
So it changes.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.550
As you go round here, it
changes from 0 to 2 pi.

01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:16.040
So where it gets back to
here, it matches up again.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.830
But here it's actually
changed by pi,

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:22.250
so it's effectively in
the opposite direction.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:23.510
So that's what I mean by that.

01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:25.100
There's a continuous
phase variation

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.070
as you go round there.

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:31.400
And on this one,
elliptical polarization

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.870
with a phase singularity, what
it means is that the light is--

01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:40.550
anywhere on here, it's
elliptically polarized,

01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:45.320
like this, say, but
at any angle it will

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.600
be a similar sort of ellipse.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.320
But the phase of
this ellipse will

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:56.690
change with a face singularity
as you go around in the circle.

01:21:56.690 --> 01:22:02.620
And so what happens
if you do that?

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.370
Well, this is what you get.

01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:07.070
So this is looking
at the cross section

01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:10.070
for three different angles
for all these different types.

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:14.660
And so this is for
Bessel beams again.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.760
They're the simplest
to calculate.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:20.550
So what we find is
that for small angles,

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:23.030
the radial polarized is no good.

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:26.510
It turns out that the reason
why radial polarization works,

01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:29.330
actually, is because--

01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.830
sorry.

01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:31.960
I should have said this earlier.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.600
I don't know why
I didn't, really.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:39.620
Why it works is because the
light that comes down here

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.600
has got some polarization
in this direction here,

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:47.050
which means it's got a component
in this longitudinal direction.

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:51.280
So actually, the
radially polarized light

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.360
put into the lens produces a
longitudinal electric field

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.680
in the focal region.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.010
And that might seem very
strange to people, first of all.

01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:01.900
You can actually
generate a wave that's

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:07.720
moving along which has got a
longitudinal electric field.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.120
But that seems to
be what is true.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.710
But the point is, of course,
if this angle is small,

01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:19.280
then this longitudinal component
is going to be very weak.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.090
And that is why this
racially polarized one here

01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:27.220
doesn't work well, because the
transverse field is dominating

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.020
over the longitudinal field.

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.000
But as you increase
the aperture,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.170
you see it gets
better, like that.

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:40.380
And then I also show
here the electric dipole.

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:43.600
All these are all the same on
this, for this small angle,

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.290
but they for the larger
anguish they become different.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:51.240
And this is showing how--

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.410
sorry.

01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:54.770
This arrow has moved
itself for some reason.

01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:57.400
I don't know why
it's moved itself,

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.210
but that this was supposed to
be pointing to this blue line

01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:03.980
here and showing
how, in this case,

01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:08.030
the TE1 case is the narrowest.

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:11.300
It's actually even narrower
than the radial in this case

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.740
here, but with some
rather slightly--

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.330
some bigger side lobes here.

01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:21.550
And this shows also the
electric dipole case as well.

01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:25.850
And this one's showing how the
plane polarized case is really

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:28.730
very bad, as we showed
earlier, once you

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.050
get to really big angles.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:39.240
And then this is
comparing them a bit more.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.290
This is actually plotting
the normalized width

01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:44.270
of that rotationally
symmetric spot

01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:47.710
that you get, again, for
all these different cases,

01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:49.430
and showing--

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:52.310
so these are the cases
of a full aperture.

01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:55.370
These are the cases
of a Bessel beam.

01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:57.650
And you can see that,
actually, it turns out

01:24:57.650 --> 01:25:04.390
that the TE annulus is the
narrowest, the TE Bessel beam,

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:06.650
all the time, for any angle.

01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:10.420
It's always narrower than
the radially polarized one.

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:14.020
And for these cases here,
for the full circular case,

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.890
the TE one is always
narrower than the green one

01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:20.210
until you get to
this point here,

01:25:20.210 --> 01:25:24.100
which corresponds to a numerical
aperture of 0.98, which

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:28.880
is higher than you would ever
get to in a practical system.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.610
So what this is all
showing is that, as I say,

01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:37.240
putting plane polarized
light in is not the optimum.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:41.920
It turns out that very often
the optimum can be different

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.990
according to the
circumstances, but it

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:46.960
can be this electric
dipole polarization

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.890
or it can be the
radially polarized input

01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:54.100
or it can be the
transverse electric.

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:57.150
And I think I--

01:25:57.150 --> 01:26:01.490
yeah, this is showing the
strength of the side lobes

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:06.830
and showing how the transverse
electric might be narrower,

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:08.480
but it might have
bigger side lobes.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:11.540
So here the radially polarized
has smaller side lobes,

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.900
weaker side lobes, than the TE.

01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:22.800
So and there's our
conclusions about this, then.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.890
So if you focus plane
polarized light,

01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:27.960
you'll get a big focal spot.

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.562
So you can improve that by
using radially polarized light,

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:34.020
and that comes
about because you've

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.920
got this strong longitudinal
field on the axis.

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:41.280
But we find that electric
dipole polarization actually

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.100
gives a higher electric
energy density at the focus,

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.250
as I showed earlier,
higher than you get

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:50.340
with radial polarized light.

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:56.100
And then I showed that the
TE1 mode polarization gives

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:59.400
the smallest central
lobe, and it's smaller

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.320
even than you get with
radially polarized light.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.830
But the TE on its
own is asymmetric,

01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:11.200
but you can make a
symmetric version of it,

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.430
which is equivalent so
azimuthal polarization

01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:17.100
with a phase singularity.

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:23.120
So that's about it for what I
was going to say about this.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.790
So this is finishing
up the course

01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:29.810
with something which is really
sort of ongoing research

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:33.423
and something that,
I think, there's

01:27:33.423 --> 01:27:35.090
a lot of people around
the world working

01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:38.180
on these different problems
and trying to optimize

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:43.280
these systems to get the best
possible focusing properties

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.940
that you can get
with a high NA lens.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:50.090
And I mentioned before all the
many different applications

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:54.240
that there's this
could be used for.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.490
So I'm going to stop, then.

01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:57.310
Questions?

01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:58.650
Any questions about this?

01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:01.150
Any questions about earlier?

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:03.130
There's lots of questions
about this are there?

01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:04.698
Yeah, maybe.

01:28:04.698 --> 01:28:06.490
There's a lot of
information there, I know.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:11.260
I think you're probably all
suffering from overload.

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:17.650
But it's all very complicated,
actually, but very beautiful

01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:18.580
as well, I think.

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:22.500
It's nice physics, I think.

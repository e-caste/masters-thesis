00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.070
If you remember our discussion
from a long time ago, we said

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.790
that much of this class consists
of variations of a

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.540
few basic skills and ideas,
one of which is the Bayes

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.670
rule, the foundation
of inference.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.580
So let's look here at the
Bayes rule again and its

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.670
different incarnations.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.530
In a discrete setting we have a
random variable with a known

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.210
PMF but whose values
are not observed.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.450
Instead we observe the value
of another random variable,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.040
call it Y, which has some
relation with X.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.800
And we will use the value of Y
to make some inferences about

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.570
X. The relation between the
two random variables is

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.390
captured by specifying the
conditional PMF of Y given any

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.690
value of X. Think of X as an
unknown state of the world and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.530
of Y as a noisy observation of
X. The conditional PMF tells

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.840
us the distribution of
Y under each possible

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.970
state of the world.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.420
Once we observe the value of Y
we obtain some information

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.990
about X. And we use this
information to make inferences

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.070
about the likely values of X.
Mathematically, instead of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.820
relying on the prior for X, we
form some revised beliefs.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.280
That is, we form the
conditional [PMF]

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.130
of X given the particular
observation that we have seen.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.370
All this becomes possible
because of the Bayes rule.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.400
We have seen the Bayes
rule for events.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.090
But it is easy to translate
into PMF notation.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.140
We take the multiplication
rule.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.990
And we use it twice in different
orders to get two

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.610
different forms--

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.090
or two different expressions--

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.479
for the joint PMF.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.990
We then take one of the terms
involved here and send it to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.710
the other side.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.100
We obtain this expression,
which is the Bayes rule.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.560
What [do] we have here?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.630
We want to calculate the
conditional distribution of X

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.920
which we typically call
the posterior.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.860
And to do this we rely on the
prior of X as well as on the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.740
model that we have for
the observations.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.660
The denominator requires us to
compute the marginal of Y. But

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.350
this is something that is easily
done because we have

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.250
the joint available.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.190
The numerator, this expression
here, is just the joint PMF.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.790
And using the joint PMF
you can always find

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.770
the marginal PMF.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.910
Essentially, we're using here
the total probability theorem.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.160
And we're using the pieces of
information that were given to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.600
us, the prior and the model
of the observations.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.020
When we're dealing with
continuous random variables

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.690
the story is identical.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.880
We still have two versions of
the multiplication rule.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.810
By sending one term--

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.570
this term--

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.270
to the other side of
the equation we

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.150
get the Bayes rule.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.070
And then we use the total
probability theorem to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.600
calculate the denominator
term.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.860
So as far as mathematics go,
the story is pretty simple.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.500
It is exactly the same
in the discrete and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.740
the continuous case.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.440
This story will be our stepping
stone for dealing

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.270
with more complex models and
also when we go into more

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.300
detail on the subject
of inference

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.550
later in this course.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.080 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: Last
time, so we're talking

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:90%
about a set of real numbers.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And last time, I stated
the following theorem

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
about the existence
and properties of R

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:90%
that make it special.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So the theorem is, there
exists a unique ordered field

00:00:50.650 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
with the least upper
bound property containing

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:90%
the rational numbers.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So remember, a
field was a set that

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
had operations plus
and multiplication.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
An ordered field also this
set has an order on it.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And this order interacts
with the operations

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
of addition and multiplication
in natural ways.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And the least upper
bound property

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
means every non-empty subset
which is bounded above

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:90%
has a supremum in the set.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So least upper bound
property, meaning the supremum

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.420 align:middle line:84%
belongs in R, not necessarily
in the non-empty set,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:90%
which is bounded above.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And we saw last time that
q, the rational numbers,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:90%
does not have this property.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
By looking at that set,
q positive rational q

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:90%
squared less than 2.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
That set was bounded
above but didn't

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
have a supremum in
rational numbers,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
because the square
root of 2 essentially

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:90%
is not a rational number.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And the square root of
2 would be the supremum.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So just based on this
theorem which characterizes

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and constructs R, the
set of real numbers,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to prove
facts about real numbers

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and soon turn to limits.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So as I said in the
beginning, limits

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is or are the central
object of study in analysis.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what analysis
is, the study of limits.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The real analysis
part, or the real,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
we're doing this

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.165 align:middle line:84%
within the setting
of the real numbers.

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me just point
out something kind of simple

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:90%
about the real numbers.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, extremely simple
fact about the real numbers

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is it's not discrete
like the integers are.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So for the integers, if I
take one integer and another,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
the case that there's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
an integer strictly
in between them.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
There's not an integer
between 0 and 1.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And but R does
satisfy this property,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
essentially because
it's a field.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:90%
So and it's an ordered field.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So what's the simple fact,
if x, y are real numbers,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and x is less than y, then
there exists a real number

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
r, a little r, so that x is
less than r is less than y.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I can give you r explicitly.
r is equal to x plus y over 2.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
All right, that's
not so surprising.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, this statement
here is also true

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
if I replace r with
rational numbers.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Namely if I had two rational
numbers, 1 less than the other,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
then there exists a rational
number in between that's

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:90%
between x and y.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I just again, define
r in this way.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, a natural question
is the following,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
is that if x and y are in
R, and x is less than y,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
then does there--

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll put a question mark
over that-- does there

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
exist an R in q such that x
is less than R is less than y?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't necessarily define
R by this formula here

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and guaranteed that
R will be rational.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
x equals root 2,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and let's say y equals 2
root 2, then x plus y over 2

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
equals 3/2 root 2, which
is not a rational number.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if it were a
rational number, then

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I can multiply 2 through by
2/3 and say square root of 2

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:90%
is a rational number.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So all of that to
say, that simply

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
by doing this trick of just
taking the average does not

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
necessarily mean that if
I take two real numbers,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
1 less than the other, then
there exists a rational

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:90%
in between them.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:90%
That's not so clear to see.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:90%
But this is one of the most--

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the
basic facts about R,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the answer to
this question is, yes.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And that in some sense
the rational numbers

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
are dense in the real numbers.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:84%
For any to real numbers,
I can find a rational

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:90%
in between them.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the first main property of
the real numbers we'll prove.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.852 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a consequence of
a second property we'll prove,

00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
Archimedean property.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:90%
So this theorem has two parts.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Its first is called
Archimedean property of R.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And the statement of this
is, if x and y are in R,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and x is positive, then there
exists a natural number N,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:90%
such that nx is bigger than y.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
part of this theorem

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
is the statement that
the rationales are dense.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
That the answer to
this question is, yes.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So this usually goes by
the name of the density

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:90%
of the rationales.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it states that if x and y
and in R, and x is less than y,

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
then there exists a
rational number little r,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
such that x is less
than r is less than y.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove
the first theorem,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
the first part of this theorem,
the Archimedean property.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So what do we have to use
to prove this theorem?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Just what we know about
the real numbers, the fact

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.977 align:middle line:84%
that it's an ordered field with
the least upper bound property.

00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how this least
upper bound property plays

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
a major role in all of
these elementary things we

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:90%
prove about R.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:90%
So let's restate our hypothesis.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:90%
So suppose x and y are in r.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:90%
And x is less than--

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.215 align:middle line:90%
and x is bigger than 0.

00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.935 align:middle line:90%
So we wish to show--

00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
so just restating
this inequality here,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.876 align:middle line:90%
we wish to show--

00:08:57.876 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
the word show, you should read
as synonymous with prove--

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that there exists
a natural number N,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.425 align:middle line:84%
such that n is
bigger than y over x.

00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:90%
That's just restating that.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to prove
this by contradiction.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So the proof will
go by contradiction.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again,
this is our hypothesis,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
which we will assume
throughout the proof.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing we're trying to
prove is this statement here,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:90%
the second sentence.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is the thing
that we will negate.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
We will not negate
the hypothesis,

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
we're negating what we
want to prove in the end.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And then arriving at
a false statement.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Therefore showing our
conclusion is true.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So we assume that the
second statement is false.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're assuming
the first statement.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.915 align:middle line:90%
So suppose not, i.e.

00:10:13.915 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
for all N a natural number, n is
less than or equal to y over x.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the negation of the
fact of there exists an integer

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:90%
that's bigger than y over x.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So then that means then
the natural numbers

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
as a subset of the real
numbers is bounded above.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, the set of natural
numbers is a non-empty subset

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
of R, which is bounded above.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it has a supremum.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So by the least upper
bound property of R,

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
N has a supremum,
call it a in R.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So since a is the supremum of N,
anything smaller than a cannot

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
be an upper bound for
the natural numbers.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, a is supposed
to be the least upper bound.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Anything smaller than that
cannot be an upper bound

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:90%
for the natural numbers.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Is not an upper bound for N.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So if a minus 1 is not
an upper bound for N,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
that means there must exist some
integer in N which is strictly

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.245 align:middle line:90%
bigger than a minus 1.

00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
There exists a
natural number, I'm

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
going to call it m, such that
a minus 1 is less than m.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But then, this implies
that a is less than m

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:84%
plus 1, which
implies that a is not

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
an upper bound for
the natural numbers.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Because m plus 1-- m is an
integer, a natural number.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:90%
So m plus 1's a natural number.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've just found a
natural number bigger than a.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
That means a can't be an upper
bound for the natural numbers.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But and therefore a does
not equal the sup of N.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is a contradiction.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Because A is defined
as a sup of N.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So from the assumption,
just to recap,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:84%
just from the assumption
that for all natural numbers

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:84%
N, N is less than or
equal to y over x.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
We concluded that it
has a supremum that's

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
not its supremum.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's a false statement.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, our
initial assumption

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:84%
that for all
natural numbers N, N

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to y
over x, that must be false.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there
exist an N, which

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than y over x, which
is what we wanted to prove.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So for the proof of the
second theorem, the density

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:90%
of rational numbers, we'll do--

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.075 align:middle line:84%
so we have three
cases to consider.

00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So both x and y
are real numbers.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.885 align:middle line:90%
x is less than y.

00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
There are three
cases, call it A,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:90%
x is less than 0 is less than y.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
B, 0 is bigger than or
equal to x is less than y.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And C, x is less than y is
less than or equal to 0.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So we want to find a rational
number between x and y.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So for this case,
this is pretty simple.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:90%
We just take R to be 0.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to say
anything about case A. I'm just

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
going to move on to case B.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So case B. So suppose x is
bigger than or equal to 0

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and less than y.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Then by AP I'll refer to--

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So that'll be shorthand notation
for the Archimedean property.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So part one, which we've
already proven is true.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
By the Archimedean property,
there exists a natural number

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
N, such that N times y
minus x is bigger than 1.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.535 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to use
Archimedean property again.

00:16:25.535 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There exists an integer
l and a natural number

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
l, such that l is
bigger than n times x.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Thus, the set of all integer--

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of natural numbers
k, such that k

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than nx is non-empty.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is a subset of
the natural numbers.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
So it has a least element.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
By the well ordering property
of the natural numbers,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:90%
S has a least element m.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Now what does this mean?

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:90%
What does m have to satisfy?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
show is that m over n

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
is in fact, a rational number
that is between x and y.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:90%
So the goal is, I guess--

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
so let me just make
a comment here.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So once we've made--

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
once we've found this
natural number, little n,

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.077 align:middle line:84%
so that n times y minus
x is bigger than 1,

00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:90%
what does this mean?

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
This means n times y is
bigger than nx plus 1.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:90%
So our goal is then to find--

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
so this stuff in
brackets, you should not

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:90%
consider as part of the proof.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
This is me trying to explain
to you where from here

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
we would like to go to conclude
the proof that there exists

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:84%
a rational number
between y and x.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have this inequality,
the Archimedean property

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
tells us there's a natural
number that satisfies this.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we would like to do is
find another natural number.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm foreshadowing what's
to come-- a natural number m--

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:90%
well, let's not--

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.937 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to give
you any false hopes.

00:18:59.937 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're not false.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.062 align:middle line:90%
It'll happen in a minute.

00:19:02.062 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:90%
But let's call this j.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:90%
So that two things happen.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:90%
n times x is less than j.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And j is less than or
equal to nx plus 1.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.486 align:middle line:84%
So if we're able to find such
an integer j satisfying this,

00:19:30.486 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
these two inequalities,
then from this inequality

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.415 align:middle line:84%
we would get that
ny is bigger than--

00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:84%
or this is bigger
than nx plus 1,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
which is bigger than or equal
to j, which is bigger than nx.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:84%
let me just rewrite
this. nx is less than j,

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:90%
is less than n times y.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Or in other words, x is less
than j over m is less than y.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.215 align:middle line:84%
And here's our rational
number which we would choose.

00:20:06.215 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's the game
plan, which maybe I

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
should have said
right after I came up

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:90%
with this integer little n.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
You may be asking why I come
up with this integer little n.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to
start somewhere.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Archimedean
property gives us this.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And this somehow gives us
a scale to at least a scale

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:90%
1 over n to kind of work on.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so going
back to the proof.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have by the
well ordering property

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of the natural
numbers, this set S,

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
which is a set of
all natural numbers

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
so that k is bigger than nx
has a least element little m.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now m, so S has a least
element m, means m is in S.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So since m is in S,
this means simply

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
by the definition of what
S is, nx is less than m.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
properties we wanted--

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I wrote it as j, but we
wanted an integer to satisfy.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.248 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.248 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Since m is the least element
of S, m minus 1 is not in S.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So that implies that m minus
1 not in S means m minus 1

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to n times x, i.e.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.386 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.386 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
n is less than or equal
to n times x plus 1.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll combine these
two inequalities along

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:84%
with the first one
involving n times y minus x.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just basically
rewriting what

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.965 align:middle line:84%
I told you our goal was
here in this bracket.

00:22:21.965 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Then, n times x is less than m.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than
or equal to n times

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
x plus 1, which by
our definition of n

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in the first inequality we
have up there involving y

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:90%
is less than n times y.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.547 align:middle line:84%
So we have nx is less
than m, is less than y.

00:22:48.547 --> 00:22:54.765 align:middle line:84%
So that means x is less than
m over n is this less than y.

00:22:54.765 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So r equals m over n, which is
a proportion of natural numbers,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.508 align:middle line:90%
is our choice.

00:23:16.508 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
That's an awkward way
to finish a sentence.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
But my mind went blank.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, so that
handles the case B,

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:90%
So one small thing that I--

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:90%
just a very minor comment.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
If you've got all this, and
you understand it, that's fine.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But you may be asking since
I never actually said it

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.092 align:middle line:84%
out loud, where did
I use the fact that x

00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 0?

00:23:51.300 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So where I used that-- so let's
just assume x is bigger than 0.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So what where did I use is
really right in this place

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to spend
too much time on that.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But by being able to claim
that m minus 1 is not in S.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:90%
So what about case C?

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So case C, we'll just
reduce to case B. Suppose

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
x is less than y, which is
less than or equal to 0.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Then 0 is bigger than or
equal to minus y, which

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than minus x.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So by case B, there exists
a rational number, R tilde,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
such that minus y is less than
R tilde is less than minus x.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Then this implies that
x is less than minus R

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:90%
tilde is less than y.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So R equal to minus
R tilde does the job.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:90%
So that proves the theorem.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:45.383 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.383 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So we'll use this
in just a minute

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to prove a simple statement
about sups and infs.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But before I use
it, let me go on.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to do
is state a different way

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to verify that a number is a sup
of a set or the inf of a set.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
state it for sups.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's an analogous
statement for infs.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.820 align:middle line:90%
So the theorem is this.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And this will actually
be on the assignment.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So assume S is a subset of R
is non-empty and bounded above.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:90%
So S has a supremum.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to tell you
what the supremum satisfies.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's an if and
only if statement.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Then some number x equals
a sup of S if and only if--

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:84%
so either I'll do
a double arrow,

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:90%
or I'll write if and only if--

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.870 align:middle line:90%
two conditions are satisfied.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The first is that x is
an upper bound for S.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And the second, so at one point,
or in the very near future,

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be seeing
epsilons and deltas.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:90%
So I'll state it this way.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So you should start
seeing them now.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:84%
For every epsilon positive,
there exists an element y

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
in S such that x
minus epsilon is less

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.095 align:middle line:84%
than y is less
than or equal to x.

00:28:59.095 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:90%
So why is this--

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:90%
why should this be the case?

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, if S is all over
here to the left of x, then

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and if I take something
smaller, so I'm

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:84%
actually kind of giving you a
picture proof of one direction.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, if I take something
smaller, x minus epsilon,

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
then this cannot be
an upper bound for S.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, there
must exist some y in S

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:90%
bigger than x minus epsilon.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's less than
or equal to x,

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:84%
because x is an
upper bound for S.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, this picture is
a proof of this direction,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:84%
namely if x is
the supremum of S,

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:84%
then these two
conditions are satisfied.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.715 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the
assignment I'll have

00:29:52.715 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:84%
you prove the other
direction, basically,

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that these two conditions
imply that a real number is

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:08.710 align:middle line:90%
the supremum of S.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's use this
theorem and Archimedean

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
property to prove
a simple statement

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.370 align:middle line:90%
about the sup of a simple set.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So I should-- so let
me also write here--

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.987 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.987 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to
state it as a theorem.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just-- this is a remark
meaning I'm being a little bit

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:84%
loose with what I'm writing
down, but it's true--

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:90%
x equals inf of S.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So for S, a non-empty subset
which is bounded below,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
there's an analogous
characterization

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:90%
as x is a lower bound for s.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And for all epsilon positive,
there exists a y in S,

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
so that x is less than or
equal to y is less than x

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.630 align:middle line:90%
plus epsilon.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is the analogous
statement for the inf,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.086 align:middle line:90%
for something to be the inf.

00:31:12.086 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is, I guess you
could call it a theorem.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not a very
spectacular theorem.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But if I look at the set 1 minus
1 over N, in a natural number,

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and I take its sup,
this is equal to 1.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So this shouldn't
surprise you too much.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Because what is this set?

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the set 0, 1/2,
2/3, 3/4 4/5, and so on.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So you see 1 is
always bigger than

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:90%
or equal to everything in here.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's certainly
an upper bound.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And everything is kind of
progressively getting closer

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:06.730 align:middle line:90%
to 1.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So it should satisfy
the second property.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Namely, if I go a little
bit to the left of 1,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
then I'll be able to
find something less than

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 1 and bigger than
that thing to the left of 1.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And that'll be how we
prove this theorem.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So first off, since 1 minus
1 over n is less than 1,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:84%
for all natural
members N, this implies

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
1 is an upper
bound for this set.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
verify that one satisfies

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that second property
of the theorem,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that for every epsilon positive,
I can find a natural number

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.650 align:middle line:84%
little n, so that
1 minus 1 over n

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:11.480 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than 1 minus epsilon.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use the Archimedean
property for that.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're ever
supposed to show

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
something for every
epsilon positive,

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:84%
then every proof should start
off with epsilon be positive.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll give you a
couple of points on the exam

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:44.470 align:middle line:84%
if there's epsilon delta
m's whatever proofs, which

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.960 align:middle line:84%
means you should prove
something for all epsilon--

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a couple
of points on the exam

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.070 align:middle line:84%
if you just at least state
let epsilon be positive.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:90%
So then, there exists--

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:16.600 align:middle line:84%
so by the Archimedean property,
there exist a natural number N,

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:84%
such that 1 over epsilon is
less than N. This is taking,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:84%
for example, in the statement
of the Archimedean property,

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:34.305 align:middle line:84%
if you like, it's taking x to
be 1 and y to be 1 over epsilon.

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Then 1 minus 1 over n--

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:90%
so let's do it this way.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Then 1 minus epsilon is--

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:90%
so since epsilon is less than--

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.850 align:middle line:84%
1 over epsilon is
less than n, this

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to saying 1
over n is less than epsilon.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, minus epsilon
is less than minus 1 over n.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So then, 1 minus epsilon
is less than 1 minus 1

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
over n, which is as we have
up here, is less than 1.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Thus, there exists a
natural number N, so that--

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:90%
so that went kind of quick.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was, I
found a natural number

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.910 align:middle line:84%
N, which is bigger
than 1 over epsilon.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, typically,
I won't state it like this,

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll state it more like this.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.997 align:middle line:90%
Which this follows from this.

00:36:00.997 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I make a statement
like, choose a natural number

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
so that 1 over n is
less than epsilon,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that follows from the
Archimedean property

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
just by taking 1
over this inequality.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And so.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
From there we concluded
that 1 minus epsilon

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
is less than 1 minus 1 over
n, which is still less than 1.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have
proven the second--

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:90%
number two property of 1.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And thus by the theorem,
1 is equal to the supremum

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:90%
of this set.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's get a little
more familiarity

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:59.573 align:middle line:84%
with using sups and infs,
and in particular using

00:36:59.573 --> 00:37:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that theorem, which
I stated right

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.050 align:middle line:84%
there, about this
characterization of the sup

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:84%
as being an upper bound and
satisfying the second property

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.012 align:middle line:84%
that for every
epsilon positive you

00:37:09.012 --> 00:37:10.470 align:middle line:84%
can find something
in the set which

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than x minus epsilon.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.925 align:middle line:84%
So to do that, let's look at
a couple of different sets--

00:37:17.925 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.530 align:middle line:84%
types of subsets
of real numbers.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So for x a real
number and a subset,

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:90%
we define two sets, x plus a--

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.600 align:middle line:90%
this is just a shift of a by x.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is a set of all elements
of the form x plus little a,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
where little a is a
capital A. x times a,

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:59.838 align:middle line:84%
this is a set of all elements
of the form x times a,

00:37:59.838 --> 00:38:02.960 align:middle line:84%
where a is in capital
A. So from now

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:84%
on basically towards
the end, until almost

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
the end of the course,
we're working as in subsets

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.460 align:middle line:90%
of the real numbers.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So these things are meaningful,
plus and multiplication.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
following theorem.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- let me
state the assumptions.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll probably
guess the conclusions.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:84%
If x is a real number,
and A is bounded above,

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
then the conclusion is x
plus a is bounded above.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And the supremum of
this set x plus A

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:59.230 align:middle line:84%
is equal to x plus
the supremum of A.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:90%
We should be able to guess this.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Because let's assume A
is this interval here.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:90%
That would make the sup A--

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.310 align:middle line:84%
this, let's say right
endpoint of this interval,

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:22.070 align:middle line:84%
then when I shift everything
by x, then this point

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:84%
sup A shifts to x
plus sup A, which

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:31.120 align:middle line:84%
should be the supremum
of x plus capital A.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.260 align:middle line:90%
So this is not too surprising.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There are surprising
theorems in analysis.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:84%
We already saw of one, at least,
I thought it was surprising.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully you found
it surprising,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.330 align:middle line:84%
about the cardinality
of the power set

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.500 align:middle line:84%
compared to the cardinality
of the original set.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:84%
You come up with this
strange-looking--

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
or the proof of that,
remember, you came up with this

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.000 align:middle line:84%
strange-looking set
which you had to--

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.590 align:middle line:84%
which in the end basically
referenced itself

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:13.830 align:middle line:84%
in its definition, which led
to the conclusion we wanted.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:90%
But this one is not so scary.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.980 align:middle line:84%
This one you should
be able-- this theorem

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.470 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to
believe and maybe even prove

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.440 align:middle line:90%
without me telling you how to.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:90%
If not, that's fine too.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The other statement is
that if x is positive

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and A is bounded above,
then x plus A, or x times A,

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:90%
sorry, is bounded above.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And sup of x times A equals
x times the sup of A.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, so if I were to
draw a picture, and let's

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
say A is kind of symmetric
with respect to 0.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's sup of A,
and I multiply it by x.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Then this either fattens the
interval or makes it smaller.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's say I made it smaller.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Now to x times A,
then x times sup of A

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:84%
would be the
supremum of this set.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Why x positive?

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason is because
if I multiply by x negative,

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:84%
this not only shrinks
it but it flips things.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, there's a
statement in the book

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.910 align:middle line:84%
about if x is
negative, then here you

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.410 align:middle line:84%
would need to assume
A is bounded below.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So the corresponding
statement for x negative

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:84%
is, if x is less than 0
and A is bounded below,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:90%
then x times A is bounded above.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Because multiplying by something
negative flips inequalities.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And the sup of x times
A is equal to minus

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:20.410 align:middle line:84%
x times the inf of A.
Or there's no minus.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:84%
This should be sup
of x times A is

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:29.460 align:middle line:90%
equal to x times the inf of A.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove
these two theorems

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:84%
using this previous theorem
that I stated without proof,

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:84%
but you'll prove in the
assignment about how

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.990 align:middle line:84%
to characterize sups
of sets as upper bounds

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and satisfying this
epsilon property.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:43:02.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So let me just restate
our assumptions.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:15.545 align:middle line:84%
So suppose x is in R,
and A is bounded above.

00:43:15.545 --> 00:43:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:32.095 align:middle line:84%
Then the number
sup A exists in R,

00:43:32.095 --> 00:43:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because R has the least
upper bound property.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:90%
A is a non-empty subset.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So I should have said
that, so all of this

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is for a non-empty
subset of A, so that I'm

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:90%
talking about something.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So I have a non-empty
subset, which

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.800 align:middle line:84%
is bounded above by the
least upper bound property.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The supremum of A
exists in R. So now

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show that
x times the sup of A

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.800 align:middle line:84%
satisfies that it's an
upper bound for x times A.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Then for all little
a in A, since sup

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound for
capital A, little a

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to sup
A, which implies that for all a

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.670 align:middle line:84%
in capital A, if I
multiply through by x,

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I add x to both
sides, x plus little a

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to x plus sup of A.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Which implies that
x plus sup of A

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound
for the set x plus A.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
property we wanted

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:84%
to prove of x plus
sup A. Now, we'll

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:84%
prove the second property,
this epsilon property.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Then by the previous theorem,
there exist a y in A such

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that sup minus A is less
than epsilon is less than y

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to sup A.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.900 align:middle line:84%
This is just from the fact
that the supremum of A

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.310 align:middle line:84%
satisfies those two
conditions up there.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I just add x through all
of these inequalities, which

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:53.490 align:middle line:84%
implies there exists a
y in A, such that x plus

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:59.040 align:middle line:84%
sup A minus epsilon
is less than x

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:08.850 align:middle line:84%
plus y, which is less than
or equal to x plus sup of A.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.408 align:middle line:84%
And that proves the
second property.

00:46:11.408 --> 00:46:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Because what have I done?

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I found that for every epsilon
positive, an element of the set

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.300 align:middle line:90%
x plus A--

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.820 align:middle line:84%
so I'll even--
I'll restate this--

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.320 align:middle line:84%
which implies there exists
an element z in the set

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.305 align:middle line:84%
x plus capital A,
namely x plus y.

00:46:28.305 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So that x plus sup A minus
epsilon is less than z

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:55.050 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to x plus sup A.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
second property which

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.030 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to prove,
this epsilon property.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we've proven it for x plus
sup A, for the set x plus A.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Thus, sup of x plus A
equals x plus sup A.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So we proved that x plus sup
A is the supremum of x plus A

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:32.330 align:middle line:84%
by showing it was an upper bound
and it satisfied this epsilon

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:32.830 align:middle line:90%
property.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's essentially
the same proof

00:47:45.090 --> 00:48:01.620 align:middle line:84%
for x times capital A.
You just replace pluses

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:02.820 align:middle line:90%
with multiplication.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.472 align:middle line:90%
How much time do we have?

00:48:14.472 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, I'm running
a little short on time.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I guess a little
slow-moving today.

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So I will not go
through actually

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.680 align:middle line:84%
write the proof of
the second part,

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.870 align:middle line:84%
simply because the
same logic works.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Only now, I replace
everything by multiplication

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:42.098 align:middle line:90%
by x instead of addition by x.

00:48:42.098 --> 00:48:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, almost.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.020 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, why not.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through the
proof real quick.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I just won't spend as much
time explaining stuff.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So now we want to do--

00:48:55.790 --> 00:49:04.180 align:middle line:84%
we want to show x times sup
A is a supremum of x times A.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:13.945 align:middle line:84%
So suppose x is positive
and A is bounded above.

00:49:13.945 --> 00:49:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Then sup A, again, exists in
R, because A is bounded above.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.678 align:middle line:84%
And because sup A is an
upper bound for capital A,

00:49:28.678 --> 00:49:32.560 align:middle line:84%
then for all a in
capital A, a is less than

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:41.440 align:middle line:84%
or equal to sup A, which implies
that for all a in capital A,

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.430 align:middle line:84%
x times little a is
less than or equal to x

00:49:45.430 --> 00:50:00.480 align:middle line:84%
times sup A. Which implies that
x times sup A is an upper bound

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.810 align:middle line:90%
for x times A.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So we've proven that x times sup
A is an upper bound for the set

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:84%
x times A. We now want to verify
this epsilon property for x

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:19.030 align:middle line:84%
times sup A with respect
to the set x times A.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:23.218 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:50:23.218 --> 00:50:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put
it in brackets, again,

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.060 align:middle line:84%
what we want to do,
what we want to define.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:34.440 align:middle line:84%
We want to show there
exists z in x times A,

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
so that x times sup A minus
epsilon is less than z.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.860 align:middle line:84%
z is always less than or
equal to x times sup A,

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.210 align:middle line:84%
since we've proven x time sup A
is an upper bound for this set.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to keep
writing the second inequality.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
we want to prove.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.740 align:middle line:90%
We haven't proven it yet.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.360 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Then just as we did
in the plus case,

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:18.820 align:middle line:84%
then there exists an element
y in A such that sup A minus--

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:24.640 align:middle line:84%
now here, we're going to choose
y not exactly for epsilon here.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the statement
for number two

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:29.860 align:middle line:84%
holds for sup A
for every epsilon.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.640 align:middle line:84%
In particular, I can
choose anything I want here

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and find a y in between sup
A minus whatever I want here,

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.080 align:middle line:90%
which is positive in sup A.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
putting epsilon here

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:52.080 align:middle line:84%
like I did before, I'm
going to put epsilon over x.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Which I can do,
because x is positive,

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.360 align:middle line:84%
which means epsilon over
x is some positive number.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did I choose
epsilon over x?

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Because magic happens.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Then that means there
exists a y in A,

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:22.240 align:middle line:84%
such that if I multiply
through by x I get x times sup.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:27.040 align:middle line:84%
A minus epsilon is less than
x times y, is less than--

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.960 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to stop
writing this inequality.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this is always true,
because x times sup A is bigger

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.790 align:middle line:90%
than or equal to x times y.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Which implies there exists
a z in x times A. Namely,

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:84%
z equals x times y,
where y is from here,

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:56.290 align:middle line:84%
such that x times sup A
minus epsilon is less than z.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, x times sup A
satisfies the second epsilon

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:16.549 align:middle line:84%
property with respect
to S given by x times A.

00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So you see that I
wanted this in the end.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So I chose y to give me this
slightly different thing

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.200 align:middle line:90%
for epsilon over x.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end, I would
multiply through by x.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted this.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.500 align:middle line:84%
When we do proofs
for limits, you'll

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.210 align:middle line:84%
see we're always trying to make
something less than epsilon.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So quite often, we'll
have to choose something

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to be less than epsilon
over 5, or epsilon

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.600 align:middle line:84%
over some number for everything
to work out in the end,

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.563 align:middle line:90%
just like we did here.

00:53:54.563 --> 00:53:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of a
preview of things to come.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And one last simple theorem
about sups and infs.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.770 align:middle line:84%
This really doesn't use that
theorem, but just basically

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:17.230 align:middle line:84%
what the definition
of sups and infs are.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Namely that if A and
B are subsets of R,

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and for all, let's say, with A
bounded above, B bounded below,

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and for all x, y, for all
x in A, and for all y in B,

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:90%
x is less than or equal to y.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Then sup of A is less than
or equal to the inf of B.

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So picture-wise, here's
A. Everything here

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.760 align:middle line:84%
sits below everything in B.
So B has to be over here.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the sup
of A, which is there,

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:31.210 align:middle line:84%
has to be less than or equal to
the INF of B, which is there.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.513 align:middle line:84%
That's the picture that
goes along with this.

00:55:34.513 --> 00:55:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But how do we
actually prove this?

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to
use the definitions.

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Pictures do not suffice.

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Although they inform
us, they don't suffice.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.005 align:middle line:90%
So this is quite simple.

00:55:48.005 --> 00:55:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
rewrite the hypotheses now,

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:55.840 align:middle line:90%
because it'd take a little bit.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:08.820 align:middle line:90%
But so if for all x in--

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.390 align:middle line:84%
let me-- basically
what we're going to do

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to take
a sup and then an inf.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So let y be in B.
Then for all x in A,

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.350 align:middle line:84%
x is less than or
equal to y, which

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:45.206 align:middle line:84%
implies y is an
upper bound for A.

00:56:45.206 --> 00:56:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
supremum of A, which

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:53.915 align:middle line:84%
is the least upper bound, has to
be smaller than or equal to y.

00:56:53.915 --> 00:56:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we've proven for all
y in B, sup A is less than

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.620 align:middle line:90%
or equal to y.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Which implies that sup A
is a lower bound for B.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And by that same
logic a minute ago,

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:29.570 align:middle line:84%
so remember the infemum of B
is the greatest lower bound.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So if I take any
lower bound of B,

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:37.330 align:middle line:84%
it has to be less than or
equal to the inf of B. So

00:57:37.330 --> 00:58:14.160 align:middle line:84%
which implies sup A is less
than or equal to inf B.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting to close
out here our discussion of--

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.260 align:middle line:84%
or at least our discussion
of the elementary properties

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.130 align:middle line:90%
of the real numbers.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So let me say just
a couple of things

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.030 align:middle line:90%
about the absolute value.

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:35.880 align:middle line:90%


00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.175 align:middle line:84%
And let me recall
how this is defined.

00:58:38.175 --> 00:58:40.168 align:middle line:90%


00:58:40.168 --> 00:58:42.210 align:middle line:84%
At least, this is how it
should have been defined

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.450 align:middle line:90%
from your calculus class.

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:50.400 align:middle line:84%
If x is in R, we define
the absolute value of x.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:56.400 align:middle line:84%
This is either x if x is
bigger than or equal to 0,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:01.350 align:middle line:84%
or minus x if x is less
than or equal to 0.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Note that these two
things agree when x is 0.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So that I'm not defining
the absolute value

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.645 align:middle line:84%
of x to be two different
things when x equals 0.

00:59:09.645 --> 00:59:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So and what is this
really meant to be?

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be--

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.380 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to measure
the distance from--

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.540 align:middle line:90%
or it's supposed to represent--

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say,
is the distance,

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.640 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't told
you what a distance means.

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But what is it
supposed to represent?

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to represent the
distance from x to 0, which is

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.570 align:middle line:90%
why it's always non-negative.

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I have
x was over here.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And this distance is
meant to be absolute value

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:06.440 align:middle line:90%
of x [INAUDIBLE] that y.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:11.720 align:middle line:90%


01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, that's the first
thing that [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to prove
some very simple properties

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.740 align:middle line:90%
of the absolute value.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, these
properties should not

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:22.520 align:middle line:90%
be surprising to you.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.880 align:middle line:90%
You should know all of them.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But we're trying
to get familiar--

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.550 align:middle line:90%
that's a tough word to say--

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
familiarities, or
familiarity with proofs.

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do is many
proofs as I can for you.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So the first statement
is, for all x in R,

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
absolute value of x
is bigger than 0--

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.650 align:middle line:90%
bigger than or equal to 0.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the absolute value equals
0 if and only if x equals 0.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.780 align:middle line:90%


01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
The second property is
that for all x in R,

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.685 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of x equals
the absolute value of minus x.

01:01:10.685 --> 01:01:15.120 align:middle line:90%


01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
For all xy in R, if I take the
absolute value of the product,

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.035 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the product
of the absolute values.

01:01:25.035 --> 01:01:32.600 align:middle line:90%


01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
For all x in R, the
absolute value of x squared

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
equals the absolute
value of x squared.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:50.134 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.134 --> 01:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The fifth property is,
if x and y is in R,

01:01:54.910 --> 01:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
then x is less than or
equal to y if and only

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
if minus y is less than
or equal to x is less than

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.830 align:middle line:90%
or equal to y.

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth property
that we'll prove

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:22.353 align:middle line:84%
is that for all x
in R, x is less than

01:02:22.353 --> 01:02:23.645 align:middle line:90%
or equal to its absolute value.

01:02:23.645 --> 01:02:28.800 align:middle line:90%


01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, these are
not too surprising.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But we'll go through the
proofs, because that's

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
the point of this class.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.060 align:middle line:90%


01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Later on in life you'll come
across some more interesting

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
theorems than
definitely this one.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.790 align:middle line:90%


01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So if-- so we're going to prove
this first statement, that if x

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
is in R, the absolute value of
x is bigger than or equal to 0.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So if x is bigger
than or equal to 0,

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
then the absolute value
of x is by definition

01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:10.555 align:middle line:84%
equal to x, which is
bigger than or equal to 0.

01:03:10.555 --> 01:03:13.670 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
If x is less than or equal
to 0, then the absolute--

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
then minus x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And by the definition
of the absolute value,

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.912 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of x
is equal to minus x, which

01:03:30.912 --> 01:03:32.120 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 0.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's proven that
the absolute value of x

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.005 align:middle line:84%
is always bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:03:36.005 --> 01:03:38.950 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's prove
this statement.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Absolute value of x equals
0 if and only if x equals 0.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%


01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you see an if and
only if, or two arrows here,

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that means there's two
statements you need to prove,

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that this implies this,
and this implies this.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
this direction.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Usually in if and only if,
there is an easy direction.

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
If x equals 0, then
this is clear simply

01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:14.370 align:middle line:90%
from the definition.

01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:18.135 align:middle line:84%
Then absolute value of
x equals x equals 0.

01:04:18.135 --> 01:04:20.880 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's go with the
other direction.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:31.225 align:middle line:84%
So suppose the absolute
value of x equals 0.

01:04:31.225 --> 01:04:34.120 align:middle line:90%


01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And if x is bigger
than or equal to 0,

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
we get that x is equal to
its absolute value of x

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.140 align:middle line:90%
is equal to 0.

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.700 align:middle line:90%


01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:52.320 align:middle line:84%
If x is less than or
equal to 0, then minus x

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
is equal to its absolute
value of x, which equals to 0,

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.860 align:middle line:90%
or x equals 0.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So assuming the absolute
value of x is 0,

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
we've proven that x
equals 0 in both cases.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%


01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.045 align:middle line:84%
So that proves the
first property.

01:05:12.045 --> 01:06:07.810 align:middle line:90%


01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:10.465 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're on to
proving number two.

01:06:10.465 --> 01:06:18.931 align:middle line:90%


01:06:18.931 --> 01:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So number two, for all x in
R, the absolute value of x

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.380 align:middle line:90%
equals minus x.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do that by, again,
we have to consider two cases.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
x is non-negative or
x is non-positive.

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So if x is bigger
than or equal to 0,

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
then minus x is less
than or equal to 0,

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:47.800 align:middle line:84%
which implies that the
absolute value of minus x

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:52.832 align:middle line:84%
equals minus minus x, which
equals x, which equals

01:06:52.832 --> 01:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of x
since we're in the case

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:56.370 align:middle line:90%
that x is non-negative.

01:06:56.370 --> 01:07:00.510 align:middle line:90%


01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If x is less than or
equal to 0, n minus x

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to 0, which

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
implies that the
absolute value of minus x

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
is equal to minus x, which
is, since x is less than

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.890 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 0, and
by the definition

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of the absolute value, equal
to absolute value of x.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.750 align:middle line:90%
So that proves too.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%


01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So for all xy real number, the
absolute value of x times y

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the absolute value
of x times absolute value of y.

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So we need to
consider two cases.

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
One of them is--

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
both of them are non-negative,
both of them are non-positive.

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And both of them are--

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
or one of them is positive,
one of them is non-negative,

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
or one of them is non-negative,
one of them is non-positive.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So if x is bigger
than or equal to 0,

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and y is bigger than or
equal to 0, then x times y

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to 0, which

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
implies x, the absolute
value of x times y

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.680 align:middle line:90%
is equal to x times y.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And since x is
non-negative, that's

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.859 align:middle line:90%
equal to its absolute value.

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Since y is non-negative, that's
equal to its absolute value.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:33.580 align:middle line:90%


01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.859 align:middle line:84%
If x is bigger
than or equal to 0,

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and y is less than
or equal to 0,

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:52.090 align:middle line:84%
then minus x times y is
bigger than or equal to 0,

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
which implies that the
absolute value of x times y

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.290 align:middle line:90%
is equal to--

01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:04.770 align:middle line:84%
so I should say, let's
write it this way.

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to minus xy, which
is equal to x times minus y.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And since y is negative, minus y
is equal to its absolute value.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And since x is non-negative, x
is equal to its absolute value.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to that.

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:25.740 align:middle line:90%


01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.729 align:middle line:90%
Another piece of chalk.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%


01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Now the case that--

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%


01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
so you might be
thinking about what

01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:51.819 align:middle line:84%
about x negative and y
non-negative, so y bigger

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to 0, x
less than or equal to 0.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the same proof,
just exchange x and y.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going
to do that case.

01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And if x is less
than or equal to 0,

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.950 align:middle line:90%
y is less than or equal to 0.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Then this implies that minus x
is bigger than or equal to 0.

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And minus y is bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Which by this first
case, which we've proven,

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
now applied to
minus x and minus y,

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I get that the absolute value
of minus x times minus y,

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to x times y, so
minus x times minus y is equal

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.200 align:middle line:90%
to x times y.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the absolute
value of minus x times

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%
the absolute value of minus y.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.393 align:middle line:84%
And by number two, which
we've already proven,

01:10:42.393 --> 01:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
which is that the absolute
value of minus the number

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.040 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the absolute
value of the number again,

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
we get that.

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.360 align:middle line:90%


01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's three.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.280 align:middle line:90%


01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And for four, this is just
a special case of three.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.340 align:middle line:90%


01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Take y equals x in three.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.700 align:middle line:90%


01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, for number five,
it's an if and only if.

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So we need to prove
two directions.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Namely, we'll assume
this, and then prove this,

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and then assume this,
and then prove that.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So suppose-- so this is this
direction, meaning suppose--

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
our assumption is going to be,
suppose the absolute value of x

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.695 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to y.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:41.690 align:middle line:90%


01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So then, x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Then this means that--

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
so if the absolute value of
x is less than or equal to y,

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that automatically tells
you y is non-negative.

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, minus
y is less than

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 0,
which is less than

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:05.070 align:middle line:84%
or equal to x, which equals
the absolute value of x, which

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to y.

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:07.230 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:11.100 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
minus y is less than or equal
to x is less than or equal to y.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So in the other case, that x
is less than or equal to 0,

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I can apply basically this
part which I've already proven.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.760 align:middle line:90%


01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
n minus x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And the absolute
value of minus x,

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to the
absolute value of x,

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to y, which

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
implies by this first case I've
proven applied now to minus x

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.890 align:middle line:84%
here, that minus y is less
than or equal to minus

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:55.700 align:middle line:90%
x is less than or equal to y.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And multiplying through by minus
1 flips all the inequalities

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and also flips the
sign, which basically

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
means it leaves this
inequality unchanged

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:08.780 align:middle line:90%
if I replace this by x.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So multiply through by minus
1 flips the inequalities

01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:18.820 align:middle line:90%
and proves what we want to do.

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.960 align:middle line:90%
So in either case--

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
so for the first case, we
actually wrote down a proof,

01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and we reduced the second case,
x negative, to the first case

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.580 align:middle line:90%
that we've already proven.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So we've proven that this
inequality, the absolute value

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
of x less than or equal
to y, implies that this.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So now, we need to prove
the converse direction.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:53.156 align:middle line:90%


01:13:53.156 --> 01:13:54.830 align:middle line:90%
So the converse direction.

01:13:54.830 --> 01:14:08.370 align:middle line:90%


01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So suppose minus y is less
than or equal to x is less than

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:16.770 align:middle line:90%
or equal to y.

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I want to prove the
absolute value of x is less than

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.820 align:middle line:90%
or equal to y.

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.520 align:middle line:90%


01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So if x is bigger
than or equal to 0,

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
then the absolute value
of x is equal to x,

01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
which by this inequality
is less than or equal to y.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:48.650 align:middle line:84%
If x is less than or
equal to 0, then minus y

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
x, implies that minus x

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.400 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to y.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And because x is
negative, minus x

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
is equal to its absolute value.

01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:04.935 align:middle line:90%


01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we've proven
the absolute value of x

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:10.570 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to y.

01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:14.080 align:middle line:90%
So we've proven number five.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And number six, so for
number six, what do we do?

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
We just take y equals the
absolute value of x from five,

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to conclude that x is less than
or equal to the absolute value

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of x and bigger than or equal to
minus the absolute value of x.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:47.315 align:middle line:90%


01:15:47.315 --> 01:15:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's the proof.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:56.820 align:middle line:90%


01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
prove one last theorem.

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So this one is actually
very important,

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
about the absolute value.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It's probably--
so this inequality

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most important
tools in all of analysis.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And you get to see it right here
in your first analysis class.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
There's two-- basically
two other things

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:30.670 align:middle line:84%
we'll prove at some-- at one
point, which I don't know,

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
are the two other most
important things in analysis.

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:36.630 align:middle line:90%
This is the triangle inequality.

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And the other two are
integration by parts and change

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
of variables.

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Those three things fuel
the analysis machine.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So this theorem, so this
is the triangle inequality.

01:16:50.490 --> 01:17:00.950 align:middle line:90%


01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And it states for all xy in R,
the absolute value of x plus y

01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
the absolute value of x

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.970 align:middle line:90%
plus the absolute value of y.

01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Why is it called the
triangle inequality?

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's try to think, so
although x and y are elements

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:26.240 align:middle line:84%
of the real number
line, let's instead

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.605 align:middle line:84%
try and think of these
as two vectors instead.

01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:40.970 align:middle line:90%


01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:42.860 align:middle line:90%
So here's the vector x.

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:45.575 align:middle line:90%
And then, let's say--

01:17:45.575 --> 01:17:50.620 align:middle line:90%


01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
so actually, I'm
running out of time.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So I think we'll stop here.

01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:12.000 align:middle line:90%

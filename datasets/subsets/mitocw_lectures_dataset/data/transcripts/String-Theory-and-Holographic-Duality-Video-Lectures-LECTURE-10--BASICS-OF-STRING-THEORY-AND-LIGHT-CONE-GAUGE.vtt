00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.280
HONG LIU: So let
me first remind you

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.430
what we did at the
end of last lecture.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.380
Say, suppose you can
see the string moving

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.390
in some spacetime M. So it's
the following metric, given

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.420
by g mu nu and the coordinate,
which I've denoted by X nu.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.600
So nu typically will go from,
say, mu nu, go from 0, 1 to D

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.640
minus 1.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.660
And capital D will be
the [? number of ?]

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470
spacetime dimension.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.550
And then the worldsheets will
be characterized by this X mu

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.415
as a function of worldsheet
coordinate sigma tau.

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:04.965
Then this describe
the [? mapping ?]

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.430
of a two-dimensional surface
embedded in the full spacetime.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.920
And then we also
use the notation

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.380
of X mu equal to
sigma a, and sigma a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.390
will be sigma 0, sigma 1, and
equal to tau and sigma, OK?

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.760
And then the simplest
action, which

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.490
have a clear geometric
meaning, is essentially

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.540
just the action that is given
by the area of the surface.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.640
Given by the area
of the surface.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.300
And this delta h is
the induced metric.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.480
So if you have embedding
in this spacetime,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.020
then this embedding will
induce a longitudinal metric

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.060
on the worldsheets.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.149
So this h is the induced
metric on the worldsheet.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940
And then if you take
the determinant of it,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.430
then it essentially
gives you the area.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.780
[? Adamant ?] on
the worldsheets.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.410
But we also showed
that classically, this

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.310
is action is equivalent
to this action.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.770
You can rewrite it by
introducing something

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.706
like a Lagrangian
multiplier like gamma ab.

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:18.270
And then by eliminate gamma
ab, then you cover this.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.100
OK?

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.569
And the equation of motion
for the gamma ab-- yeah,

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.610
if you solve the equation
for gamma ab, the thing

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.600
you will get something
like this, lambda hab.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.889
And lambda is
arbitrary constant.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:32.680
Arbitrary function.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.210
Yeah, say if you solve
the equation of motion

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.300
for gamma ab, and then
that's what you get.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.140
So for this final
form, so this is

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.010
the action we will
use to quantize it,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.280
is because this action have
a nice polynomial form.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.570
Have a nice polynomial form.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.140
Not like this action,
which is a square root.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.860
It's always awkward.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.080
And so this have a
nice polynomial form.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.080
And then when you
quantize the action,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.930
say if you do path
integral quantization,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:37.640
then you need to integrate
both dynamic variables.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.700
So exponential i
Sp gamma on X. OK.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.782
So both are dynamic variables.

00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:51.740
When you quantize, you
have to do path integral

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.170
over all of them.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.750
And so let me just
say a little bit more

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.050
about the geometric, which
we mentioned at the end

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.820
in last lecture, the geometric
meaning of this action.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.340
So if you just look
at this action itself,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.000
this just like a scalar field
in a two-dimensional curved

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.311
spacetime.

00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:16.019
And this two-dimensional
curved spacetime

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.490
have a longitudinal metric,
which is given by gamma.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.210
And the scalar field
is just this X, OK?

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.510
So this gamma can be considered
as some kind of intrinsic.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.170
And we can see that
as an intrinsic metric

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.950
on the worldsheet.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.530
And then this X still
describes this embedding

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.270
of this worldsheet in spacetime.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.040
But X, from the point of
view of this two-dimensional

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.750
worldsheet, it just behave
like a scalar field.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.230
It just behave like
a scalar field.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.690
So when we quantize
this action, so

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.340
when we do the path
integral, if you just

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.080
do the path integral
over DX, then

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.670
this is just like a standard
two-dimensional quantum field

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.497
theory, OK?

00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:07.580
Just like a standard
two-dimensional quantum field

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.990
theory.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.740
But what's unusual
here, when you quantize

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.370
a string, because the gamma
is also a dynamic variable,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.860
you also have to
integrate over gamma.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.010
And this make it
more nontrivial,

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.720
and then this is no longer
just like quantizing the scalar

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.640
fields.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.080
And because you are integrating
over all possible intrinsic

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.740
metrics on the worldsheet.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:36.080
So this is like
quantizing 2D gravity.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.939
When you integrate over
all possible metric,

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.480
then this is like
quantizing gravity.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:54.410
But this is only the
gravity on the worldsheet,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.480
coupled to D scalar fields.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.300
OK?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.610
Yes.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.520
AUDIENCE: So in what
sense is it 2D gravity?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.212
Because the metric is
like a D by D object.

00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:14.920
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.780
Gamma is a
two-dimensional metric.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.080
It's intrinsic metric
on the worldsheet.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.720
Yeah, so it's two by two.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.370
[? ab's ?] only goes two by two.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.060
ab is only going from 0 to 1.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.360
Yeah, so ab only runs over
the worldsheet at 0 to 1.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.990
Yeah.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.790
So once you write
that form, then

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.930
you introduce an intrinsic
metric on the worldsheet.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.370
They introduce an
intrinsic curved spacetime

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.770
on the worldsheet.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.974
And when you integrate
over all possible metrics,

00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:55.890
then that's corresponding
to take into account

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.150
the fluctuations in the metric,
from this two-dimensional point

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.990
of view.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.410
So that's why we say this is
like quantizing 2D gravity.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.850
By gravity we just
mean the spacetime.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.950
OK, is this clear?

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.560
So now we see the
question of quantizing

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.270
the string theory,
essentially [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.850
to quantize this two-dimensional
gravity on worldsheets

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.039
coupled to these scalar fields.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.955
And these scalar fields
describe the embedding

00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:26.000
of your worldsheet.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.680
OK?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.960
So we will consider
a simple example.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.445
We will consider
the example which

00:07:33.445 --> 00:07:37.140
M is just Minkowski spacetime.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.970
Three-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, OK?

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.085
So in this case, g mu nu
[? come ?] [? equal ?] to eta

00:07:45.085 --> 00:07:45.710
[INAUDIBLE] nu.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.270
And then this Polyakov action
can also be simplified.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.730
So this SP now just
become 1 over [? 4 ?]

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:11.300
alpha prime, d square sigma,
gamma ab, partial a X mu,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.430
partial b X mu.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.850
So now when I write
this X mu, X mu

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.790
should be understood
that they are

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.440
contracted by the
standard Minkowski metric.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:32.880
So now, this is really,
if you just look at the X,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.760
this is like free
scalar field series,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.289
because of the dependence
on x, purely quadratic.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:47.800
So this is like a free scalar
field in curved spacetime,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.070
in curved worldsheet,
2D worldsheet.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.660
So this still slightly unusual
thing about this scalar field

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.720
theory, from our standard one.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.230
Actually, I might be missing
a minus sign somewhere.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.400
I might be missing
overall minus sign.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.740
I think I'm missing
overall minus sign.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.830
Just let me put it here.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.470
I think I'm missing
overall minus signs.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.780
For our current purpose,
it does not matter.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.720
But I think for the
later purpose we need it.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.060
Because if you can see
the standard field theory

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.260
using this minus [? 1 ?] metric,
then I need the minus sign.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.050
OK?

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.190
So this is just like a
free scalar field theory

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.080
in this 2D curved spacetime.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.717
But the slightly [? thing ?]
unusual about this one,

00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:53.050
so there are two unusual things.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.330
One is that we also
need to integrate gamma.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.830
But there's a lot
of unusual things,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.460
even from the perspective
of scalar field theory.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.440
And so if you look at
the 0-th component of X,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:15.970
because eta 0,0-- we are using
the eta equal to minus 1, 1.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.310
Because eta 0,0 is minus 1.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:27.280
So the 0-th component of X, we
have a opposite kinetic term

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.780
to the other component, OK?

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.810
So you might have learned in
your quantum field theory class

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.730
that actually you cannot change
the sign of your kinetic term.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.830
Otherwise you get instability,
because then your Hamiltonian

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.130
will be unbounded
from below, et cetera.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.670
So this action, so our story
here have two unusual features.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.440
One, you have to
integrate over gamma.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.610
And the second is
that [? the 1 over ?]

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.560
the scalar field have
the wrong kinetic term.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.370
OK.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.260
The sign with kinetic
term is wrong.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.620
And we will see that these
two features actually

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.960
solve for each other.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.147
And this is actually
a consistent theory.

00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:12.480
So this is actually consistency.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.640
Any questions at this point?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.410
OK, so before you do any
theory, what you should do?

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.630
So before you work
on any theory,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.154
what should you do first?

00:11:29.154 --> 00:11:31.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.830
HONG LIU: No, no,
that's too far away.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.320
Just the first
thing you should do.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.967
After you write down the action
[? Lagrange, ?] what should do?

00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:40.850
AUDIENCE: Solve the
equation of motion.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.700
HONG LIU: That's
still too far away.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.700
AUDIENCE: Check units.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.860
HONG LIU: That's something
what you should do.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.783
Yeah, but that is
done in kindergarten,

00:11:51.783 --> 00:11:53.635
so it's not included here.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.430
AUDIENCE: Constants of motion.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.550
HONG LIU: That's close.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.470
What is responsible
for constant of motion?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.249
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:06.040
AUDIENCE: Symmetry.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.664
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's
right, symmetry.

00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:09.400
You first have to
analyze the symmetries.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.000
OK, so that's what we will do.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.130
OK, let me call
this equation three,

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.910
just continue from my
notation of last week.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.210
Yeah.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.640
So first we should analyze
the symmetry of this action.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:49.550
So first, so this is a mapping
to a Minkowski spacetime.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.340
The Minkowski
[? spacetime ?] itself

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.140
have a Poincare symmetry.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.520
And that Poincare symmetry
will be reflected here.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:07.580
First we have the
Poincare symmetry of X mu.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.320
In other words-- and this
action is invariant--

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:18.660
if you take X mu to go
to X mu plus a constant.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.250
OK, so a mu is a constant.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.190
So it's obvious this is
invariant because everything

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.600
on [? X ?] we said derivative.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.395
So if we shift by X
mu with a constant,

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.550
then I'll call that a symmetry.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.205
And also, this is invariant
under Lorentz symmetry.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.340
OK.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:53.840
So lambda is the constant
Lorentz transformation.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.230
OK?

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:06.510
So this is also self-evident,
because of this contraction,

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.700
if you make a constant
Lorentzian transformation,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.450
you don't see the derivatives.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.400
And then this is contracted
as Lorentz scalar,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.530
then this is invariant.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.030
OK?

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.335
So this is the first
set of symmetry.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.470
The second set of symmetry
essentially by construction,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.780
because we are writing
this as a scalar

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.730
field in the curved spacetime.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:46.325
Then this is invariant in the
two-dimensional coordinate

00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:46.950
transformation.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.250
And in other words,
this is invariant

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:03.920
on the reparameterization
of the worldsheet.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.815
OK.

00:15:09.815 --> 00:15:11.690
So this is essentially
a less [? desirable ?]

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.960
condition, which should
satisfy by any string action,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.110
because as we said
before, sigma tau,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.179
you just parameterize
your worldsheet.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:25.720
And you actually
should not depend on

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.810
how you parameterize it,
and that parameterization

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.180
should be arbitrary.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.430
You should be able to change
your parameterization.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:39.630
Because if you think about
the surface in spacetime,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.620
no matter, you can say
parameterization cause

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.290
[INAUDIBLE] agreed
on the surface.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.811
Whether you do it this way, or
you do it in some other way,

00:15:48.811 --> 00:15:51.102
if you're not changing the
surface, the property of the

00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:52.340
surface itself.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.510
So that means the
action itself should not

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.710
be invariant on the
reparameterization

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.580
of your worldsheet.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.330
And the parameterization
of the worldsheet

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.540
translates into just arbitrary
coordinate transformations.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.480
So sigma and tau
should be able to, say,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.590
if you make arbitrary
coordinate transformation,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.190
and the action
should be invariant.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.320
OK.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.750
And this is by construction.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.030
And this is action by
construction in [? Lorentz. ?]

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.440
And this number goes to action.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.217
And Polyakov action we
obtained by rewriting

00:16:27.217 --> 00:16:28.300
this number called action.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.475
It's also about construction.

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:32.225
Because its [? manner fits ?]
because this

00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:35.140
is in [INAUDIBLE] in the
curved space actions for scalar

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.850
fields.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.940
So this automatically
invariant under

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.952
the coordinate transformation.

00:16:40.952 --> 00:16:42.660
And under this coordinate
transformation,

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.440
this X mu just transformed
[? my ?] scalar field.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.720
So the scalar field transforms.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.410
Say as the following
is going to X mu prime.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.560
And X mu prime,
we've evaluated here

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.540
that the new coordinate
tau prime and sigma prime

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.859
should be the same as
your original X evaluated

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.760
at the original location.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.560
So this is essentially the
definition of a scalar field.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.400
You see that when you make
a coordinate transformation,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.354
if you follow the point, the
value of X does not change.

00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:23.020
Because when you go
to the new location,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.011
the X prime evaluated
at new location

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.760
should be the same as
your original value.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.396
OK.

00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:29.210
Yes.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.418
AUDIENCE: So basically we
have a few more [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.780
variants in real space,
and the worldsheet.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.495
That's like--

00:17:35.495 --> 00:17:38.120
HONG LIU: No, no, this is not if
your [? morphism ?] invariant.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.640
No, this is not [? different ?]
[? morphism ?] invariant.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.250
AUDIENCE: What about in
a special case, though?

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.680
HONG LIU: No, this is not
[? different ?] [? morphism. ?]

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.013
No, this is not different
[? morphism. ?] This is global

00:17:45.013 --> 00:17:45.520
symmetry.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.852
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, OK.

00:17:47.852 --> 00:17:51.970
AUDIENCE: And also, did we ever
consider curved real space?

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.285
HONG LIU: Yeah, you can
consider-- well, curved space.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.780
But right now we are at the high
school level of string theory

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.920
class, and if you
go to curved space,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.380
there should be college in
that level of string theory.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.287
It's beyond what we
are doing right now.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.120
AUDIENCE: That's
[INAUDIBLE] curve of space,

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.770
we don't have Poincare.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.110
Will we have Poincare?

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.360
HONG LIU: Yeah, then you
don't have Poincare symmetry.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.210
So this is specific
to this action.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.930
But this is [INAUDIBLE] general.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.660
So, of course, under this
coordinate transformation,

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.000
this gamma ab should
transform as a tensor,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.910
as in standard [? in GR. ?]
This evaluated gamma prime you

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.770
evaluate at a new point, should
be [? related ?] as a tensor.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.230
OK.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.265
So you can check yourself.

00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:00.640
This essentially
by constructing,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.140
but you can check yourself
that the action is indeed

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.980
invariant under those
transformations.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.262
OK?

00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:10.570
AUDIENCE: Is there also gauge
symmetry for this, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.674
add a [? phase ?] to X and
derivative with a it cancels.

00:19:15.674 --> 00:19:16.340
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.870
AUDIENCE: Is there
[? any gauge's ?] theory in--

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.870
HONG LIU: Gauge in what?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.061
Gauge in which one?

00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:23.560
AUDIENCE: X, like
in equation three,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.410
[INAUDIBLE] either global
[? phase ?] to X and derivative

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.105
with a and--

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:28.980
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.350
No, X is real here.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.804
This is our full action.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:33.470
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.030
OK.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.080
HONG LIU: Yeah, these
are full action.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.810
X are real.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.840
So this is invariant on that.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.050
We will not show this
is [? invariant. ?]

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.320
This just essentially
by construction.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.330
You should check it yourself,
if you are not convinced.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:58.540
So the third symmetry is called
a Weyl scaling of gamma ab.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.200
So the [INAUDIBLE] are
slightly surprising.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:14.560
So under this symmetry,
X mu does not change.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.100
But the metric we multiply
it by overall prefactor.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.590
And this omega is
arbitrary for any function.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.240
OK.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.520
So this is a very important
symmetry, so let's check that.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.350
So when you multiply the gamma
by our overall prefactor,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.930
when you go to gamma
ab, then that's

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:55.550
giving you the same prefactor,
but with a minus sign here.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.040
And now, in the
determinant for gamma,

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.880
then that give you
the square of these.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.770
And then take the square root,
then give you a positive power.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.620
Then they cancel.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.030
Is it clear?

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:12.870
So the [INAUDIBLE] power here
cancels with the positive power

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.290
here.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:14.870
OK?

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.995
So this thing is invariant.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.310
On [INAUDIBLE] symmetry.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:26.970
So the way to see that--
another way to understand

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.672
that somehow this
action-- so the same thing

00:21:31.672 --> 00:21:32.380
with this action.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.290
This is not specific
to we are working

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.340
with Minkowski spacetime.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.539
The same feature here only
depend on these two, OK?

00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:41.830
So the same thing happens here.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.720
So you can also
see a feature why--

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.130
and you can also get a feeling
why this is such symmetry,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.260
just by looking at the relation
between the Nambu-Goto action

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.290
with this action.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.160
So in this Nambu-Goto
action, there's no gamma.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.240
OK, so in some
sense you can see.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.650
You can say this
is automatically

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.620
invariant under this
kind of symmetry,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.400
because there's no gamma.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.200
And now we see that
the equivalence--

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.290
we write down equation
of motion to go

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.876
from here to Nambu-Goto action.

00:22:20.876 --> 00:22:23.330
The equivalence
between them, they

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.210
can be related by
arbitrary function lambda.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.010
And really by aperture
function lambda,

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.260
yeah, this is another
way to see this symmetry.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.420
OK?

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.003
It's another way to
see this symmetry.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:46.920
So in some sense, you can say
that this symmetry is also

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:52.390
required for the equivalence
to the Nambu-Goto action, OK?

00:22:52.390 --> 00:23:04.480
So we can actually use-- we
can also turn things around.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:13.145
We can also use as a
symmetry principle.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.040
OK.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.300
I see major points
that we can ask.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.280
Suppose we have action.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.755
Suppose we require an action
to satisfy the a, b, c,

00:23:33.755 --> 00:23:35.830
to be invariant under a, b, c.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.090
What is the most general action?

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.070
OK?

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.960
And then, you can essentially
uniquely determine the three.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.970
OK.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.785
We use actually
symmetry principles

00:23:46.785 --> 00:24:00.784
to uniquely-- actually, it's
almost uniquely determined.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.660
OK, so I will explain
this "almost."

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.530
So now I use this clear.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.890
Is the logic clear?

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.550
So we do two ways.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.050
We first start with Nambu-Goto
and then we go to this action.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.380
But then we observe this
action having the symmetries.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.310
And now we ask ourselves, what
is the most general action

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.390
besides symmetries?

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.130
OK.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.370
And that then leads us back
to this term, to this action.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.491
Except there's one
more term you can add.

00:24:39.491 --> 00:24:39.990
OK.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.448
There's one other
term you can add.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.895
So that's why this is almost.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.750
So I will just
immediately write it down.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.960
This is called an Euler action.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.190
So this action actually
have a long history.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.070
So this is called Euler action.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.570
So this can be
written as following.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.000
And this lambda is
just a constant,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.990
some arbitrary constant.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:39.630
And R is the Ricci
scalar for gamma ab.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.460
OK, gamma ab is symmetric.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.900
It's a two-dimensional metric.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.295
We will construct the
corresponding Ricci scalar.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.730
So you can clearly
check this action-- so

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.340
let me call this equation four.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.080
So you can check easily that a
four is invariant under a plus

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.370
b under a.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.650
Because this does not
depend on X. OK, of course,

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.994
this is invariant under a.

00:26:06.994 --> 00:26:08.785
And this is invariant
under b, because this

00:26:08.785 --> 00:26:12.520
is a covariant action,
so this invariant on b.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.470
To see this is invariant
under c requires

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.810
a little bit of effort.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.790
Okay, requires a
little bit of effort.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:25.270
But if I write down the formula,
then it will become clear.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:30.830
So under c, if you make
such a transformation,

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:37.150
say under gamma prime equal to
[? exponent ?] 2 omega gamma.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.460
[? 2w ?] gamma.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.640
And then you find that minus
gamma prime and R prime-- R

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.210
prime means the Ricci
scalar for the gamma prime--

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:53.469
is equal to square root
minus gamma, R minus 2.

00:26:53.469 --> 00:26:56.010
The 2-- yeah, this is a formula
which you can check yourself.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.410
Maybe just directly write down.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.000
And then you see you
get one more term,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.720
but this term is a
total derivative.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.150
OK, so this term is
a total derivative.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.660
And if we impose the
right boundary conditions,

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.790
or if you can see the
compact worldsheets,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.060
then this term will
automatically vanishes,

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.100
and then this is invariant.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.210
OK?

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.460
So we have shown this is
invariant under everything, a

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.700
to c.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.550
So essentially, that's it.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.050
So these two terms are
only-- three and four

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.680
are the only terms are
invariant under a to c, OK?

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.650
There's no other terms.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.420
So total action.

00:27:51.615 --> 00:27:52.115
Then.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.670
And then this is
our total action.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:41.966
So actually some of you who
knows two-dimensional gravity.

00:28:41.966 --> 00:28:44.900
AUDIENCE: Is there a minus sign?

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.700
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.235
Maybe let me put
the minus sign here.

00:28:48.235 --> 00:28:48.734
Good.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.640
So some of you who know
the two-dimensional gravity

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.834
will immediately point
out, you actually

00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:59.000
don't need to add this term.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.090
Because this is actually
a total derivative.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:11.230
So this is a property of--
I only make a claim here.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.840
So this thing is a
total derivative.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.110
So you can check yourself.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:23.160
Go back, go to your
favorite GR book,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.200
go to your favorite GR
book, and we'll call it

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.820
the scalar, Ricci scalar in 2D.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.670
And then you find actually
the square root of gamma times

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:39.260
i is actually a
total derivative.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.290
So it will not affect the
equation motion, et cetera.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.480
But it is important.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.900
Otherwise I would not
have talked about it.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.220
Because when you go to the
Euclidean signature, that's

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.950
the standard way we
evaluate the path integral.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:09.090
So when you go to
Euclidean signature,

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:13.510
this is only-- saying that this
is a total derivative is only

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.820
a local description.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.340
It's actually a
local description.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.920
In fact, this is actually
a topological term.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.867
So locally, you can write
it as a total derivative.

00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:28.950
But if you put on the
topological [? nontrivial ?]

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.080
manifold, then you
cannot do it globally.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:41.280
And so, in fact, in the
Euclidean signature,

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.460
it's a-- actually I don't know
whether this is due to Euler.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:56.000
This Euler action is actually
equal to lambda times chi.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.450
And the chi is
equal to [? pi-- ?]

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:07.920
yeah, which is
defined to be-- so now

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.237
it's R. It's actually
2 minus 2h, OK?

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:13.820
And the h is the
genus of the surface.

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:20.176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:20.176 --> 00:31:21.550
HONG LIU: No, this
is only in 2D.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.010
AUDIENCE: This is
only true in 2D.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.510
HONG LIU: Yeah, in 2D.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.770
So in 2D, this-- even though
this is locally a total

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.120
derivative, but it's
not the global total--

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.500
But you cannot write a
total derivative globally.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.906
And so we integrated over
a nontrivial manifold.

00:31:37.906 --> 00:31:40.030
But manifold with a nontrivial
topology-- actually,

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.863
this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.460
It actually gives you
this Euler number.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.210
So example, if you
integrated on a sphere,

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.600
then you find that
this number is 2,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.251
because [? when ?] h equal to 0.

00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:55.750
And if you evaluate
it on the torus,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.190
then you find that
this is 0, et cetera.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.282
OK.

00:32:00.282 --> 00:32:00.865
So one second.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:19.110
So in the Euclidean
path integral,

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:23.790
so Euclidean path
integral, this S minus--

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:29.290
so this exponential
S Euler term--

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:36.560
just give you exponential
[? s ?] lambda chi, OK?

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.680
So now you may ring a bell,
because this is precisely

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.420
the [INAUDIBLE] term I
added before when I say,

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.740
when we sum over
different genus.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.550
You have the freedom to add
[? mechanical ?] potential,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:53.840
lambda times the Euler number.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.310
And actually this is
dictated by the symmetry.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.770
And if you include the
most general terms are

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.720
consistent with
those symmetries,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.840
then you are required to
include this Euler term.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.440
And then you'll have
automatically weight,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.740
that you would
automatically have a weight

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.490
for different genus, OK?

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:23.350
But for this theory, the
lambda is actually constant.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:28.600
So the choice of lambda
is still arbitrary,

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.030
but this does give you
a nontrivial weight.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.100
So this is weight--
different genus.

00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:42.053
Yeah.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.650
Any questions about this, yes?

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.140
AUDIENCE: So if you have
[? a nontrivial ?] topology,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.330
wouldn't the boundary term
from the symmetry also

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.202
be nontrivial?

00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.510
So wouldn't the symmetry break?

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.176
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:34:00.176 --> 00:34:02.350
AUDIENCE: If you have a
nontrivial topology, what

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.170
is the total derivative
boundary term, total derivative

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.670
of the symmetry
transformation also?

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.330
HONG LIU: No.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:14.139
No, they are different
kind of-- no,

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.080
there's no global issue here.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.740
This is just a
ordinary function.

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.739
You have to write down
this explicit to know it.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:24.639
Yes.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:27.792
AUDIENCE: So the claim was that
[? efficient ?] work, no matter

00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:29.170
what value [INAUDIBLE] input.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.954
So this is why you were able to
put in that factor at the sum.

00:34:32.954 --> 00:34:36.065
We could make lambda equal 0,
in which case, we don't have it.

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:36.690
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:41.639
Lambda is not
dictated by symmetry,

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.440
so lambda is just a
free parameter here.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:51.030
But in principle, if I
determine it exists, yeah.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.210
Just lambda equal to
0 is a special case.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.704
Yes.

00:34:57.704 --> 00:34:58.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:03.160
HONG LIU: Yeah, in
the Minkowski case

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.160
it's a little bit tricky
to talk about topology,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.635
[? et cetera. ?] So
that's why we always,

00:35:08.635 --> 00:35:10.260
when we do the path
integral, we always

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.410
go to Euclidean signature.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.920
And for example, later
when we quantized

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.990
the action, which we work
with at Lorentzian signature.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.500
And we only care, say when we
solve the equation of motion,

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.315
but we only care about
the local structure.

00:35:25.315 --> 00:35:26.690
Then we can just
ignore this term

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.106
because this does not contribute
[? to ?] local structure.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.240
Good.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.356
So to summarize, from the
two-dimensional-- so again,

00:35:38.356 --> 00:35:40.230
we can signal this as
a two-dimensional field

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.110
theory coupled to in
the curved spacetime.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.160
From that two-dimensional
perspective,

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.510
this is a global symmetry.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.225
OK, so a is a global symmetry.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.320
Because the symmetry
does not depend

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.630
on the sigma and the gamma,
and the sigma and tau.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.920
So this should leave to conserve
charge, conserve current,

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.520
conserve charge and
conserve current.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.045
OK?

00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:14.920
So we're going to see
later this indeed plays

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.210
a very important
role in physics.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:25.270
And the b and the c are what
we call the gauge symmetries,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:32.670
or local symmetries, because
they depend on sigma and tau.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:37.080
They have [? arbitrary ?]
dependence on sigma and tau.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.860
There and here can also
depend on sigma and tau.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.875
So this is what we call
the gauge symmetries.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:50.020
So for those of you who have
started Quantum Field Theory II

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.720
or even Quantum Field Theory
I, for those of you who have

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.040
quantized [? QED, ?] you know
that the gauge symmetries are

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.920
not [? general ?] symmetries.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.550
They just tells you they are
redundant degrees of freedom.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.159
OK?

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:07.200
And they just redundantly
[? with the ?] freedom.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.800
And then when you
quantize the theory,

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.470
then you need to rid of those
redundant degrees of freedom

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.760
first.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.120
Because otherwise you will
have a consistency problem.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.055
And the process of getting
rid of redundancy problems--

00:37:22.055 --> 00:37:27.300
those redundancies are
called gauge fixing.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.460
OK, so that's what we'll
get to a little bit later.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.520
So in principle,
you can just proceed

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.120
to do the path integral
quantization as we did before.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.640
And the path
integral quantization

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.450
is conceptually simple
and geometrically elegant.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.645
But it does not give you,
say, string theory spectrum.

00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:54.770
And because it's a path
integral, it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.800
If you really want to find what
are the spectrums of the string

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.210
theory, you actually have
to do the standard canonical

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.280
quantization.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.370
So that's what we are
going to do next, OK?

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.950
Now we are going to quantize
the string in the canonical way.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.580
There are many ways of doing it.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.590
I will use the simplest
way, so [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.220
the simplest way, also
conceptually simplest way.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.886
It's called the
light-cone quantization.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.400
And the meaning of this
word will be clear.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:45.260
So the basic picture will
emerge from this quantization

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:50.350
is that each oscillation
mode-- so if you have a string,

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.870
then you can oscillate, right?

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.530
Because that's what
the string does.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.640
It can oscillate.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.900
So each oscillation
mode, so the bottom line

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:07.290
is that we will show that each
oscillation mode of the string

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.165
gives rise to a
spacetime particle.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:15.940
OK.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.150
From the string
point of view, it

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.066
looks like some kind of
oscillation of string.

00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:20.890
But from the spacetime
point of view,

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.410
it's like a spacetime particle.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.500
In particular, if you
have a closed string,

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.350
then that will give
rise, say, graviton.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:33.810
Say one particular mode will
give you graviton and then

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:34.980
many other particles.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.090
Actually, we have an infinite
number of particles from string

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.923
because there's infinite
number of vibration

00:39:38.923 --> 00:39:40.350
modes with a string.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.370
And if you have an open string,
say the string which does not

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.650
close, and then
actually then you

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:52.450
find the gauge field-- a rise
in one of the vibration modes.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:59.960
Say this can either be
photon or gluon, et cetera.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.739
OK.

00:40:01.739 --> 00:40:03.530
Yeah, so this is the
thing we like to show.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:11.810
Yes.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.297
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:14.297 --> 00:40:16.630
HONG LIU: Oh, there are an
infinite number of particles.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.470
So because the
string can oscillate,

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.410
just any string
oscillate in principle

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.674
in an infinite number of ways.

00:40:22.674 --> 00:40:24.340
And if each oscillation
mode [? cause ?]

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.910
one into a particle, then you
can have an infinite number

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:26.714
of particles.

00:40:26.714 --> 00:40:27.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:30.875 --> 00:40:32.000
HONG LIU: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.290
They're completely different
from gravitons and protons.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.123
They're just completely
different particles.

00:40:36.123 --> 00:40:39.065
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
particles [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:39.065 --> 00:40:43.280
What other particles in the
same class with gravitons?

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.620
HONG LIU: Depend on
what you mean by class.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.830
AUDIENCE: Well, can you
give a second [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:51.680
In the same line as graviton,
[? what else can you do? ?]

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.900
HONG LIU: Oh, for example,
mass will spin two particles.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.978
Mass will spin three particles.

00:40:56.978 --> 00:40:58.952
AUDIENCE: Everything
will spin more than one?

00:40:58.952 --> 00:41:00.410
HONG LIU: It can
also have a scalar

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.118
particle, [? massive ?]
scalar particles,

00:41:02.118 --> 00:41:03.945
but they're all massive.

00:41:03.945 --> 00:41:06.839
AUDIENCE: That'd be boson?

00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:08.130
HONG LIU: They can be fermions.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.100
In this theory they
can only be bosons.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.150
But we can play tricks
to get fermions.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.700
AUDIENCE: So does this
predict that-- so if you

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.635
were to have a string theory
model which would reproduce

00:41:19.635 --> 00:41:20.980
the standard model,
this basically

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.604
says that at higher
and higher energies

00:41:22.604 --> 00:41:25.269
that we expect to always
see new types of particles

00:41:25.269 --> 00:41:25.810
or something?

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.018
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:28.520
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.240
HONG LIU: But we will see.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.960
You need to go to a
specific time-- we already

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.849
go to a specific
energy scale to see.

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:37.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:38.640
We can see how they're spaced.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.514
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:39.514 --> 00:41:40.070
That's right.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.486
Yeah, but that
space is determined

00:41:41.486 --> 00:41:44.570
by some energy scale, and
that scale can be very high.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.080
OK, so now we will
quantize this theory using

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.060
canonical quantization, OK?

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.669
So by canonical quantization--
so let me remind you,

00:41:56.669 --> 00:41:57.585
this is the procedure.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.220
So this is a
procedure we typically

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:09.830
explain, say, in the second day
of free quantum field theory.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:13.200
And so we are doing
the same thing here.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.620
So the quantization
procedure is the following.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.270
The first step is you write
down equation of motion.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.190
OK.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:30.134
And in the case which you
have gauge symmetries,

00:42:30.134 --> 00:42:31.425
then we fix the gauge symmetry.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.967
And the third is
find the complete set

00:42:44.967 --> 00:42:45.925
of classical solutions.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.640
OK.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:05.800
And the four is you
promote the classical field

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.470
on the worldsheet,
worldsheet field,

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.835
say the X or gamma
to quantum operators.

00:43:24.914 --> 00:43:25.910
OK.

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.220
So the quantization
procedure is that you

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.030
promote them to
quantum operators,

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.720
which satisfy the
so-called canonical

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.530
[? computation ?] relation.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.930
And the previous
equation of motion

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.910
then becomes operator
equations for those operators.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.280
OK?

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.610
In particular, then
the classical solution

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:53.930
you find in three
becomes the solutions

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:54.855
to operator equations.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.620
And in particular,
the parameters

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:18.930
we use to parameterize
your classical solutions--

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.240
so those become, say, the
creation and annihilation

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.990
operators.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.950
Just as what we do in the free
field theory quantization.

00:44:34.468 --> 00:44:37.510
And then the last step,
once you have the creation

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.595
and annihilation operators, then
you can just find the spectrum.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.392
By acting the creation
and annihilation operators

00:44:46.392 --> 00:44:48.350
on your vacuum, then you
can find the spectrum.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.030
So find the spectrum.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.610
So this is the
standard procedure.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.680
Yeah, so this is almost exactly
the same as how we quantize

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.320
our free scalar field theory.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.550
In Quantum Field Theory I,
the only tricky thing is now,

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.804
this is a system with
gauge symmetries.

00:45:11.804 --> 00:45:13.220
That's the only
tricky thing here.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.952
Any questions here?

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.649
So now let me just
again say some boundary

00:45:28.649 --> 00:45:29.940
conditions we are going to use.

00:45:33.617 --> 00:45:34.533
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.660
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.186
AUDIENCE: What are parameters
in classical solutions

00:45:43.186 --> 00:45:45.470
permutations. [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.240
HONG LIU: What other--

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.120
AUDIENCE: Parameters
in classical solutions

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.340
in case of [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:57.410
HONG LIU: It's different modes
for your classical waves.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.780
The amplitude for your
different classical waves.

00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:06.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.090
HONG LIU: Yeah, it
is like that, yeah.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:14.362
For scalar field theory, yeah,
just for harmonic oscillator,

00:46:14.362 --> 00:46:15.320
you can write a cosine.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:25.090
a explains your i omega X
plus a star, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:30.090
omega X. So a is the
parameter, and a and a star

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.239
become creation and
annihilation operator.

00:46:33.239 --> 00:46:34.280
It's the same thing here.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.675
So we will consider both
closed and open strings.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.880
So suppose closed
and open strings.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:58.610
So if you have a closed string,
then, just by convention

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.470
we always take sigma
to go from 0 to 2 pi.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.015
So the closed string
means it's closed.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.840
Then we take this
from to 0 to 2 pi.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.820
That means whatever
function should

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.680
be a periodic function of 2 pi.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.280
OK, should be a periodic
function of 2 pi,

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.720
because it's closed, OK?

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.620
So the same thing with gamma.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.430
Same thing with gamma, OK?

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:44.050
But if you have open
string, by convention

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:48.680
we take sigma goes to 0 to pi.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.510
So one end of the string
is at sigma equal to 0.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.660
The other end is at
sigma equal to pi.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.800
So for open strings, so
here is sigma equal to 0.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.490
Here is sigma equal to pi.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.720
So the sigma is
directly on the string.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.090
So we need to-- for
open strings, then,

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.740
because you have
boundaries, then

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:16.440
we need to supply boundary
conditions at the end points.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.720
Good.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.470
So now with this
set-up, we can now just

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.785
follow that five steps, OK?

00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:36.740
We can just follow that five
steps and quantize the string.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.680
So do you want to have a break?

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.660
OK, let us start.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.511
So we just follow these steps.

00:48:45.511 --> 00:48:47.260
First let's write down
equation of motion.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.860
OK, first we just do a
variation of gamma ab.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:13.200
So gamma is the
worldsheet metric

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.430
from the point of view of
two-dimensional field theory.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:19.375
The gamma is the
worldsheet metric.

00:49:19.375 --> 00:49:21.740
When you do evaluation over
gamma, essentially what

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:31.510
you get is the stress tensor
for this worldsheet theory, OK?

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.180
So when you do the
[? evaluation over ?] gamma,

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:38.430
essentially, it's
just the statement

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.760
that the stress
tensor had to be 0.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.260
OK.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:50.316
And then you can work
this out explicitly.

00:49:50.316 --> 00:49:52.700
And the stress tensor,
which I call Tab.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.054
OK.

00:50:21.054 --> 00:50:22.470
So I just
[? did the evaluation ?]

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.740
of that action with
respect to gamma ab.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.660
This is what you get
You find this thing has

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.320
to be equal to 0.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.970
And I just call this thing Tab.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:37.200
And this Tab is essentially
the stress tensor of this.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.090
If you [INAUDIBLE] the
scalar field theory,

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.280
so this Tab is essentially
the stress tensor

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.630
of this scalar field theory.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.130
OK?

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.070
Yeah.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.280
AUDIENCE: If we add the
topological term and said,

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.090
there's a Ricci
scalar there, there

00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:59.800
must be Einstein's
tensor equal to Tab.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.550
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.820
Because there's a
total derivative term

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.820
in two dimensions--
total derivative term

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.110
never contribute to
equation of motion.

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:08.840
Yeah.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.990
AUDIENCE: So but if we
calculated the Einstein tensor

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.580
for that R [INAUDIBLE] get 0.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.996
HONG LIU: You will get 0, yeah.

00:51:23.712 --> 00:51:25.295
AUDIENCE: Sorry, so
you just said that

00:51:25.295 --> 00:51:27.620
from the equation of motion,
that gamma ab can get

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.514
gamma ab equals 1/2 lambda hab.

00:51:30.514 --> 00:51:31.014
Is that it?

00:51:31.014 --> 00:51:31.860
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.277
It's the same thing.

00:51:34.277 --> 00:51:35.110
It's the same thing.

00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:40.030
But this is a very
good question.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.230
Let me do that here.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:52.660
Say if I write gamma ab
equal to 1/2 lambda hab,

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.890
I can write this
lambda explicitly.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.390
Then I can modify this
by hab on both sides

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:04.420
and this means hab gamma
ab equal to lambda.

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.812
OK, that means lambda is
equal to gamma ab times hab.

00:52:08.812 --> 00:52:10.520
And so this equation,
I can also write it

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:20.960
as gamma ab is equal to
1/2 hab gamma ab hab.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:25.785
Oh, gamma cd.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.910
Yeah, which you can show is
equivalent to that equation.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:37.660
OK.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:42.770
Or maybe I should do gamma ab.

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.560
No, if you do that
one, it doesn't matter.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:53.290
I can do-- to be exactly
the same as that equation,

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:56.100
let me just do both sides.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.620
I can track with gamma ab.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.950
Let me see, maybe I can
[? track ?] both sides.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.500
Let me think.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:18.460
So that is [? HCD ?] so that is
h gamma ab, times that thing,

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.580
is equal to--

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:30.200
Yeah, you can-- just
take this equation.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.616
You get this equation.

00:53:31.616 --> 00:53:34.240
Then you can show that equation
is equivalent to this equation,

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.990
OK?

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.890
[INAUDIBLE] right now, they're
not reading the identical way,

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:40.306
but they can show
the equivalence.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.100
So yeah, actually
that's your homework.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:54:03.645
So now if you look at
equation of motion for X mu,

00:54:03.645 --> 00:54:05.145
look at the equation
of motion for X

00:54:05.145 --> 00:54:08.220
mu, then this is
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.220
your standard scalar field.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:20.730
So this just give you-- OK,
and we call this equation six.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:31.452
So these are all of
your equation of motion.

00:54:31.452 --> 00:54:35.070
If you have open
string, then when

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:41.290
you do the evaluation
of X, you have

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:43.765
to do integration by parts.

00:54:43.765 --> 00:54:45.140
Then in the standard
[? story, ?]

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.750
you have to have
a boundary term.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:49.529
OK?

00:54:49.529 --> 00:54:51.820
But you actually have to be
careful about that boundary

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.320
term.

00:54:56.330 --> 00:55:05.780
For the open string, you
will get a boundary term,

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:13.796
which is given by delta mu
gamma sigma b partial b X

00:55:13.796 --> 00:55:21.291
mu, evaluated at sigma equal to
0 and pi, should be equal to 0.

00:55:21.291 --> 00:55:21.790
OK?

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:31.230
So this just come from where you
get this second-order equation,

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:33.260
you always have to
integration by parts

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.800
when you do the evaluation.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.550
That just comes from
the boundary term

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:37.980
of that [? variation, ?]
evaluated

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.650
at the end point
of the string you

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.611
have in the sigma direction.

00:55:42.611 --> 00:55:43.110
OK.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:43.693
Is this clear?

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.920
Good.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.874
Again, I will not go through
all the algebraic details.

00:55:49.874 --> 00:55:51.540
You should check those
details yourself.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:56:01.410
You should check them,
and if you find mistakes,

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:02.410
it's greatly encouraged.

00:56:06.217 --> 00:56:07.550
Yeah, I will add to your points.

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:14.000
Yeah, if you find mistakes,
then I will add your points.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.240
If you have found
enough mistakes,

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.456
then you may not need to
do the [? PSAT ?] anymore.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.155
So this tells us we can actually
impose two kinds of boundary

00:56:30.155 --> 00:56:30.655
conditions.

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:39.330
Say delta X mu have to be 0.

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:47.720
So evaluated at sigma
equal to 0, pi, equal to 0.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.100
Sigma 0 or pi-- it does
not have to be the same.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:57.470
Or this thing is
0, gamma sigma b.

00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:59.740
The reason the sigma here,
because we are interested

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:02.130
only in the boundary term
in the sigma direction.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.380
The boundary term in the
time direction we [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.291
care about.

00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:07.290
Because the boundary term
in the time direction,

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:10.890
we always assume in the far
past and the far future,

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.350
nothing happens.

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:14.610
We always assume that.

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:17.211
But you cannot assume a boundary
condition at the spatial

00:57:17.211 --> 00:57:17.710
condition.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:19.390
You have-- yeah, in
the spatial boundary,

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:20.806
you have to be
careful, because we

00:57:20.806 --> 00:57:23.530
have a finite--
[? a special ?] extension.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.050
OK, so that's why this sigma.

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:28.720
So a lot of the possible
boundary conditions,

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:34.720
gamma sigma b, times partial
b X mu, so evaluated at sigma

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.240
is equal to 0 or pi, equal to 0.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.700
So this is normally called the
Dirichlet boundary condition.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:47.550
This is normally call the
Neumann boundary condition.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:50.410
The reason this is called
Dirichlet boundary condition

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:56.260
because if that X is
fixed at the end point,

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:00.820
it means that the value of
X are not allowed to vary.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.600
So this is normally
called the Dirichlet, OK?

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.660
And for the Neumann
boundary condition,

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.110
you only constrain
the derivative.

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:10.467
And the value of
X can be anything.

00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:12.050
And you only constrain
the derivative.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:14.091
So this is called the
Neumann boundary condition.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:27.210
So for simplicity, later
we will treat both of them.

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.430
But for now, let me
just look at this one,

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:33.140
because this one is
slightly simpler.

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.000
So for the moment, let me just
consider the Neumann boundary

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.880
condition, OK.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.065
So now the second step
is fixing the gauge.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.330
Second step is fixing the gauge.

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:50.700
So we have two gauge freedom.

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:54.430
One is to change
the coordinates.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.870
And the one is to do a scaling.

00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:59.210
OK.

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.670
So before we fix
the gauge, let's

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:04.170
do a little bit of counting.

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:08.850
So here I can change coordinates
by arbitrary two functions, OK?

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:14.280
So here I essentially have
two arbitrary functions

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.900
with freedom of
the gauge freedom.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.010
And here, I have one
arbitrary functions

00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:25.520
for both gauge freedom, because
I can choose omega [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.170
arbitrarily.

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:32.280
And if you look at gamma ab,
the worldsheet metric-- so ab

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.590
is from 0 to 1.

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:38.020
So this also has three freedoms,
three degrees of freedom.

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.840
So that means actually,
in [INAUDIBLE] theory,

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:55.820
at least you can expect
by taking account

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.010
those degrees of freedom, taking
account of these three gauge

00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:05.040
degrees freedom, you
can set this gamma ab

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.330
to some fixed metric.

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:10.230
Because there's only three
freedom here, and we have three

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:11.140
gauge freedom.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.600
And you can completely fix them.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.545
So [? not ?] let
me erase it now.

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.017
Now let me do the second step.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:37.470
Gauge fixing using this
different morphism of b,

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.020
so these have two parameters.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:46.390
You can show that
you can just make

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:47.930
a coordinate transformation.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:52.790
Take any gamma ab, you
can show that by using

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:55.220
a coordinate transformation,
you can transform the gamma

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.740
ab to the following form.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.500
OK.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.210
So I will not prove
it here, but I'll

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:16.530
let you go back to try to
convince yourself of this fact,

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.270
OK?

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.090
Just by using the
coordinate transformation

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:24.070
starting with
generic gamma ab, you

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:25.570
can make a coordinate
transformation

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.400
so that in the new
coordinates, the gamma ab

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.180
is given by a prefactor
times the Minkowski metric.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:40.586
And now we can use
the c, that guy,

01:01:40.586 --> 01:01:43.680
because we have the
freedom to change the gamma

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.460
ab by arbitrary function.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.920
And then we can just
choose that function

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.600
to be [INAUDIBLE] to this guy.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:58.840
Then we can set gamma
ab just equal to eta ab.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.340
OK.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.560
So we can use these two
freedom to set the gamma

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.490
ab with eta ab.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:07.824
Yes?

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:10.234
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
that we can [INAUDIBLE] gauge

01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:12.162
[? toward ?] locally
on the worldsheet.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:14.630
[INAUDIBLE] gauge transform
the metric [? globally ?]

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.962
[INAUDIBLE].

01:02:15.962 --> 01:02:16.920
HONG LIU: That's right.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.320
Yeah, we can transform it
locally into [? flat ?] metric.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.020
And then, indeed, there
is a global issue of which

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.740
I will not worry about now.

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.900
Yeah, because the question
which I'm interested in,

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.830
say, the spectrum
only [? consists ?]

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:32.550
of the local questions.

01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:34.322
For example, if you
do the path integral,

01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:36.530
then you don't have to worry
about the global issues.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.410
AUDIENCE: Why?

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:44.130
Why is it that when
you [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:47.650
HONG LIU: Yeah, because
you need to integrate

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.670
over all possible
configurations.

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:54.670
And you don't want to do the
overcounting, or count mass.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:57.410
Yeah.

01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.270
AUDIENCE: So we don't
have to work this out.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.895
So why does that mean
we don't have to?

01:03:00.895 --> 01:03:01.950
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:03.500
So let me give you an example.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:10.580
For example, if you do the
genus g surfaces, and then say

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.701
let's do Euclidean again.

01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:12.200
It's easier.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.040
Do Euclidean.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.370
Indeed, you can locally
transform to eta ab

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:19.064
the actual set of
discrete parameters.

01:03:19.064 --> 01:03:21.230
And then you have to be
careful about those discrete

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.910
parameters, et cetera.

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:25.400
Yeah, just those
discrete parameters

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.372
have to do with global
issues, et cetera.

01:03:27.372 --> 01:03:28.830
AUDIENCE: I see
what you're saying.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:29.653
HONG LIU: Yes?

01:03:29.653 --> 01:03:30.569
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:36.290
HONG LIU: Yeah, just
imagine you have

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.498
some two-dimensional surface.

01:03:37.498 --> 01:03:40.620
Right now let's not
consider about the topology.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.400
Right now just consider.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.240
So in this case, for the closed
string, the simplest thing--

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.096
you can see this
[? sitting ?] there.

01:03:50.096 --> 01:03:51.220
So this is sigma direction.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.300
This is the tau direction.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.425
Yeah.

01:03:54.425 --> 01:03:56.300
Yeah, for the closed
string it's [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.730
But the open string,
roughly just like this.

01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:07.480
And right now we don't
consider complicated topology.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.020
We just consider local question.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.349
Then we can consider
the simplest topology.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
sorry, I didn't quite

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:15.010
get the path integral being--

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.465
HONG LIU: Yeah,
don't worry about it.

01:04:16.465 --> 01:04:18.330
AUDIENCE: Don't you
have to integrate around

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.344
both sides of every
[? pole that ?] you

01:04:20.344 --> 01:04:21.200
have in the--

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.785
HONG LIU: Yeah, you have to
integrate over everything.

01:04:23.785 --> 01:04:25.760
You have to be careful
about everything.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.805
AUDIENCE: So global
[? effect is a factor. ?]

01:04:27.805 --> 01:04:28.430
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:29.350
AUDIENCE: It does matter.

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:29.570
OK.

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:29.890
HONG LIU: Of course.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.806
AUDIENCE: I thought you
were saying the other.

01:04:31.806 --> 01:04:33.070
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.340
I'm saying the global effects
are very important when

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.030
you do the path integral, and
if you want to do the path

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:39.210
integral correctly.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.802
But here we are interested
in the spectrum.

01:04:42.802 --> 01:04:44.010
And this is a local question.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:54.460
OK, so now with
this gauge fixing,

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.800
we can see how the equation
of motion simplifies.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:09.530
First we have fixed
all gauge freedom, OK?

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.460
So let's look at the six first.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:17.470
So six just become a
free scalar equation.

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:19.820
Because when gamma ab
become a Minkowski metric,

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.010
this is just like
a scalar field, OK?

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:24.662
This is like a scalar field.

01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:25.995
So this we can write explicitly.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.510
So this is a free scalar field.

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:42.344
And let me call this
somehow-- oh, yeah,

01:05:42.344 --> 01:05:45.950
let me call this seven.

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:48.340
This one seven,
this one eight, just

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.690
to be consistent with my notes.

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:52.640
Then I call this nine.

01:05:56.850 --> 01:06:00.080
But if we still have to
worry about the five,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.190
OK, so the five can now
also be written explicitly.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.530
So first thing you can check
is that T0,0 is equal to T1,1,

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.330
so the diagonal
elements are the same.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:21.480
It's given by 1/2 partial
tau X mu partial tau

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:32.310
X mu, plus partial sigma X mu
partial sigma X mu equal to 0.

01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:47.570
And T0,1 component will give
you partial tau X mu [? times ?]

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.590
partial sigma X mu equal to 0.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:54.525
So I'm just writing
everything explicitly.

01:06:54.525 --> 01:06:55.900
So these are the
three components

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.910
of that equation, when I set
gamma ab equal to eta ab.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.790
You can easily check yourself.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:10.380
Just plug that in.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.237
OK?

01:07:11.237 --> 01:07:20.290
So the reason that T0,0 is equal
to T1,1 is because we actually

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.550
have a scaling symmetry.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:27.050
So in the case when
this action-- yeah,

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.260
this is a free
massless scalar field.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.030
It's a scaling symmetry.

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.580
And you know that when you
have a scaling symmetry under

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.579
the stress tensor, the
[? trace ?] of the stress

01:07:35.579 --> 01:07:41.060
tensor always vanishes, so
that's why T0,0 and T1,1.

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.986
So for the open
string, we also have

01:07:42.986 --> 01:07:44.611
to worry about the
boundary conditions.

01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:55.740
And so this just become
the Minkowski metric.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.900
And the sigma sigma, only
the sigma sigma is non-zero.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:05.620
So you just get the partial
sigma X mu equal to 0.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.747
OK, so this should be evaluated
at sigma equal to 0 and pi.

01:08:11.634 --> 01:08:14.050
So right now, we only consider
Neumann boundary condition.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.380
And let me call it 12.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.540
So this is for Neumann.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.914
Good?

01:08:27.914 --> 01:08:28.830
Any questions on this?

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.170
Yeah.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:58.409
AUDIENCE: For this Dirichlet
boundary condition,

01:08:58.409 --> 01:09:00.910
it's a [? valuation. ?]
So you already may say

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:06.920
the [? valuation ?] is
arbitrary by [INAUDIBLE] can be

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.420
arbitrary.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:12.300
So it seems like only Neumann
boundary condition is valid.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.540
HONG LIU: Yeah,
this is your choice.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.300
This is your choice.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:26.300
So normally in the field
theory, what we do-- indeed,

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.080
normally in the field theory,
yeah, this is your choice.

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:35.569
In the normal field theory,
where you consider, say,

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.170
an infinite space, we
just assume everything

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:39.590
goes to 0 at infinity.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:42.700
And we don't even need to worry
about the boundary condition.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.300
Then the boundary term
automatically vanishes.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.009
And so that's why,
normally, in the field

01:09:47.009 --> 01:09:48.591
theory in the infinite
space, we never

01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:50.080
worry about the
boundary conditions

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.520
because we made that assumption.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.070
So here, because the string
has a finite [? lens, ?]

01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.850
it's a finite boundary.

01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:02.780
And then you actually have
a freedom to introduce both.

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.030
Yeah.

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.284
You do have the freedom
to introduce both.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.090
Good?

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:25.770
So let me emphasize again.

01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:30.650
So now in this gauge, we just
have a free scalar field.

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:33.129
So this is a standard
wave equation in one

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:33.920
plus one dimension.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.155
But we are not quantizing
a free scalar field theory,

01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:42.082
because we still have
to solve those things.

01:10:42.082 --> 01:10:44.370
We have to solve
these two equations.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.470
And these are constraints.

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:48.354
Because in this
equation, in principle,

01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:49.770
you completely
solve the equation.

01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:52.270
We know that this
is a wave equation.

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.550
You already solved X completely.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:57.409
But these two equation,
coming from the gamma equation

01:10:57.409 --> 01:10:59.200
of motion, they impose
a [? longitudinal ?]

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.090
constraint we have to satisfy.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.920
And those constraints
actually last [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.320
because they are non-linear.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.820
This is a linear
equation, but these

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.450
are non-linear constraints.

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:14.830
And this is the 10,
11-- I'll normally

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:17.130
call them Virasoro constraints.

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:23.170
Virasoro was a person.

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:25.130
So this is the
Virasoro constraints.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.320
OK?

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.755
And so this allows
me to constrain

01:11:28.755 --> 01:11:29.796
the equation [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.390
So now let's first
solve the easy equation.

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:41.210
So let's go to the third
step, trying to solve

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.750
the equation of motion.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.430
And now we have fixed the gauge.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.560
And now we try to solve
the equation of motion, OK?

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:56.469
So for people at your
level, I can write down

01:11:56.469 --> 01:11:57.760
a solution of line immediately.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.870
So I can have a constant, of
course, satisfy this equation.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:14.670
I can have a linear term in
tau, which of course will

01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:18.370
satisfy this equation.

01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:20.095
For closed string,
in principle, I

01:12:20.095 --> 01:12:24.420
can also have a
linear term in sigma,

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:27.745
but that won't satisfy the
periodic boundary condition.

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:33.920
So that's not allowed.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.025
And then I can add the
traveling wave solutions.

01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:43.030
So this is a left-moving
wave, a right-moving wave,

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:46.560
and this is a left-moving wave.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.210
OK?

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:53.540
So this is a full set
of solutions to-- so

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.875
x mu are arbitrary constants.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.295
x mu and v mu are
arbitrary constants.

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:09.550
And XL and XR are arbitrary
for closed strings.

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:23.560
So XL and XR just
are independent,

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:34.900
should be independent periodic
functions of period 2 pi.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.270
OK?

01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:43.250
Because they have to be.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:47.530
So XL and XR are function
of single variable.

01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:49.460
And they have to be
period in sigma means

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.501
they have to be periodic.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.010
So these are the
periodic function.

01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:59.040
OK, is this clear to you?

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.170
Do I need to explain
this equation?

01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:02.890
Good.

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:03.390
Yes?

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:07.579
AUDIENCE: Why a function
of tau minus the sigma?

01:14:07.579 --> 01:14:09.620
HONG LIU: It's because
you have a traveling wave.

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.520
Because first we can
immediately see this

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.477
satisfies this equation.

01:14:16.477 --> 01:14:18.060
And then you need
to convince yourself

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:27.820
these are the only solutions,
in the sense that-- yeah,

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.890
because these are the
two arbitrary functions.

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:31.464
There's no other
choices anymore.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.510
Any more questions on this?

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:37.426
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.600
HONG LIU: Also not,
for other reasons.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.385
Not for the Neumann
boundary condition.

01:14:52.385 --> 01:14:53.760
Not for this
boundary connection.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.870
And now we are come
to open string.

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:09.677
So for open string, you can
then be-- again, we have these.

01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:11.510
We can check that if
you have a linear sigma

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:15.490
term [? it will be ?]
incompatible with this boundary

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:18.460
condition, so we don't
worry about that.

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.180
So we don't worry about that.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:25.650
And then, from this
equation, then plug that

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:33.420
into this equation, we
conclude that the XL prime tau

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:39.630
should be equal to XR prime
tau at sigma equal to 0.

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:47.365
And XL prime, tau
minus pi, should

01:15:47.365 --> 01:15:54.750
be equal to XR prime, tau
plus pi, at sigma equal to pi.

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:59.160
OK, so you just
plug this into here.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.390
So the first two
terms does not matter,

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.920
and then you just have
the last two terms.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:09.980
So the last two terms,
then if you evaluate it

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:16.510
at sigma equal to 0, then you
just get this equal to that.

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.970
And if you evaluate it
at sigma equal to pi,

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:21.200
then find this, OK?

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:25.110
Yeah.

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:26.526
AUDIENCE: Why is
it that you don't

01:16:26.526 --> 01:16:29.650
package those original
two terms into the right

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.500
and left functions?

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:35.710
So why is that you write
x mu plus v mu tau?

01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:39.141
HONG LIU: Because those
equation don't have this form.

01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:41.682
They're not in the form of tau
plus sigma or tau minus sigma.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.050
No, this is just tau.

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.712
This is not tau plus sigma.

01:16:49.712 --> 01:16:51.295
Now, I can [? pack it ?]
in that form.

01:16:51.295 --> 01:16:51.770
It doesn't matter.

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:53.520
I'm just saying here
I'm not doing this.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.280
Yeah.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.610
What I'm saying-- these are
trivially periodic functions.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:09.865
And yeah, I
[? just separate ?] that.

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:13.070
OK?

01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:29.700
So now, from here, you can
find that-- so this equation

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:36.030
tells you that XL is
essentially equal to XR, OK?

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:40.810
So up to a constant we can
absorb into X mu, for example.

01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:44.420
Then these two functions
could be the same.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.870
And if we take these two
function to be the same,

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.490
then this function
tells us this is

01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:56.410
a function-- the
second line tells

01:17:56.410 --> 01:18:01.790
us this is periodic in 2 pi.

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:02.290
OK?

01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:17.290
Yeah, I actually think I
missed a minus sign here.

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:20.220
So if I take the
sigma derivative,

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.970
yeah, I can put a
minus sign here.

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:24.730
But these two conclusions
still are right.

01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:41.170
So now for both open
and closed string,

01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:44.820
you have solved nine completely.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.358
Solved nine completely.

01:18:46.358 --> 01:18:47.399
Any questions about this?

01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:02.150
OK, but we still have
to solve 10 and 11.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.860
So what 10 and 11
does is to impose

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.020
some nontrivial constraints
between XL and XR

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.130
and x mu and v, et cetera.

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:18.210
I'd just say plug in this
most general solution

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:19.950
into 10 and 11.

01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:23.300
And we'll impose some
constraints on those functions.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.100
So I urge you to try it
a little bit yourself.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:31.840
And those equations
are not nice equations.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:38.590
There are lots of nice people.

01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:42.000
Yeah, there are lots
of nice equations.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:54.010
And so at this stage,
we face a decision.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:57.836
So when you see this 10
and 11 are hard to solve,

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.210
then you have a
decision to make.

01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:00.320
Yeah, whenever
you have something

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.070
that you don't know
how to do immediately,

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:03.650
you have a decision to make.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:05.020
We have some decision to make.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.730
Or you just give up.

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:15.580
And first-- so one option
is that we could just

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.500
quantize this theory.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.680
We know how to quantize this
free scalar field theory.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.160
We just quantized this free
scalar field theory first.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:28.420
And then we can construct
the Hilbert space, et cetera.

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.440
And then we can impose
those constraints

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.750
at the quantum level.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:37.790
We can impose those constraints
at the quantum level.

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:39.000
Yeah, so this is one option.

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:45.070
The second option is that
you find some ingenious way

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:49.010
to solve those equations
so that you can actually

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:52.550
find independent variables.

01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:54.620
OK, because those are
constraint equations,

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.550
means some degrees of freedom
allow the independence

01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:59.080
from others.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:04.220
So the alternative is, I
guess, you just solve it.

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:07.730
And finally, independently, with
freedom, and then quantize only

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.960
[? those ?] independently
with freedom.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.190
OK.

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:15.600
So the first option,
this stage is easy,

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.810
because you can quantize the
first [? gauge ?] field theory.

01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:21.690
But the process will impose the
constraint at a quantum level.

01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:23.270
It's actually rather tricky.

01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:24.850
So I will not go there.

01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:27.030
So I will do the second
method, [? rather ?]

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:30.130
we try to solve this
constraint, find some trick

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:33.964
to solve this constraint,
and then quantize

01:21:33.964 --> 01:21:35.130
independent degrees freedom.

01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:41.760
Is it clear?

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.400
So I will take the
second approach.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:50.430
So this is the idea of the
light-cone quantization, OK?

01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:53.230
So this is the idea of going
to the light-cone gauge.

01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:06.220
So this is an ingenious way
to solve those constraints.

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:07.730
OK?

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:12.480
And it was first
developed by four people,

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.240
including our colleague here,
Goldstone, Jeffrey Goldstone,

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.380
who was among the first people
to quantize this theory,

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.900
using the light-cone gauge.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.830
Actually they quantized
the Nambu-Goto action.

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:28.260
They did not
quantize this theory.

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.146
They quantized the
Nambu-Goto action

01:22:30.146 --> 01:22:31.270
using the light-cone gauge.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:41.800
So the key idea
is the following.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:57.800
He said after fixing this
gauge, after fixing gamma ab,

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.940
you go to eta ab.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:04.887
There are actually still
some residue gauge freedom.

01:23:04.887 --> 01:23:06.470
We actually have not
fixed everything.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.640
OK.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.630
By residue gauge
degrees freedom--

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:27.740
so if you fix the
gauge completely,

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.930
then that means that any
operation which previously--

01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:36.680
what we did b and c--
when you act on gamma,

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:42.460
we will take this away from
this configuration, OK?

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.020
So by residue
degrees freedom, it

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.546
means I can still
find the combination

01:23:46.546 --> 01:23:50.590
of coordinate transformation
and the Weyl scaling

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:53.780
so that after those
operations, I'm still

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.510
going back to this metric.

01:23:56.510 --> 01:24:00.560
OK, so is it clear what we mean
by the residue gauge freedom?

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.980
Good.

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:08.880
So to see this I
have to introduce

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.680
so-called the light-cone
coordinate on the worldsheet,

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.261
introduce sigma plus/minus equal
to square root 2 tau plus/minus

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:17.760
sigma.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.890
And then the
worldsheet metric can

01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:31.255
be written as minus d
tau square plus d sigma

01:24:31.255 --> 01:24:35.820
square-- because we take
the Minkowski metric.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.670
So this can be written as minus
2 d sigma plus, d sigma minus.

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:48.630
So now here is the
key observation

01:24:48.630 --> 01:25:01.520
is that this metric is preserved
by the following coordinate

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.290
transformation.

01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:08.680
I take sigma plus goes to
sigma tilde plus, which is only

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.880
a function of sigma plus.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.280
And sigma minus goes to some
function sigma tilde minus,

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.570
some new coordinate sigma
tilde minus, which is only

01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:19.927
a function of sigma minus.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:27.490
So if you've plugged
this in here,

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:31.680
then you'll find under this
coordinate transformation,

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.320
we get this ds tilde square.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.450
If you just plug this
in here, this is,

01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:43.220
say, 2d sigma tilde plus,
2 sigma tilde minus.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:44.947
You go to new coordinates.

01:25:44.947 --> 01:25:46.655
And [? these ?] new
coordinates expressed

01:25:46.655 --> 01:25:48.510
in terms of original
coordinates,

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:56.010
you get 2f prime sigma
plus, g prime sigma minus,

01:25:56.010 --> 01:25:58.120
and d sigma d minus.

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.870
So now the key is that under
this coordinate transformation,

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:12.710
you only transform your metric
by an overall prefactor.

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:15.800
And then you can get rid
[? of it ?] by Weyl scaling.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.404
It is preserved by this,
followed by Weyl scaling.

01:26:26.179 --> 01:26:27.970
Because this coordinate
transformation only

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:31.560
changed your metric by
an overall prefactor.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.510
And any overall prefactor you
can get rid of by Weyl scaling.

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:37.460
OK, is this clear?

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:43.561
So we actually still have some
residue of gauge freedom left.

01:26:43.561 --> 01:26:44.061
OK?

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.908
So now we can use this freedom
to do something good for us.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.960
So these new coordinates, say,
in this new tilde coordinate,

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:18.220
tau tilde, then have the form
of square root sigma plus tilde

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.660
plus sigma tilde minus.

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:21.980
OK.

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:31.580
So this have the form 1
over 2 f sigma plus tau,

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.790
and g sigma minus tau,
say tau minus sigma.

01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:40.140
So I have this form.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.060
So in this new
coordinate, yes, so you

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.290
can change the coordinates.

01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:47.800
So you're allowed to make this
kind of coordinate change.

01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:53.780
So you are allowed to make
this kind of coordinate change.

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.310
Yes, so the residue
degrees freedom

01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:59.810
means we are allowed to make
this kind of coordinate change,

01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:01.590
OK?

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:04.120
And that means--
and you see, this

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:12.080
is precisely the combination of
this form, a left-moving wave

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.345
plus a right-moving wave.

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:22.245
So that means we can
use this freedom.

01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:28.630
We can choose.

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:39.420
So this means we
can choose f and g

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:45.920
so that tau is given by any
combinations of this X--

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.930
the solutions of X, OK?

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:50.540
Because solutions of X
precisely have this form.

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:56.356
So what we will do is we will--
maybe should I erase this?

01:28:56.356 --> 01:29:01.640
Yeah, let me erase this because
I think you all know this.

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.267
So I did a level of
the equation of motion.

01:29:21.267 --> 01:29:23.350
You have the freedom.
[? You're going to ?] choose

01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:30.380
tau tilde to be any
combinations of those X, OK?

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.670
Because those X precisely
have that freedom.

01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:40.460
And the smart choice is what
we call the light-cone gauge--

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:47.060
we can choose so that tau tilde
is proportional to so-called X

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.960
plus.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.380
And X plus is defined
by square root of 2,

01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:00.380
say, the 0-th component
of X plus, say,

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.190
one of the spatial directions.

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:03.410
OK, say, take one.

01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:14.610
So to fix this gauge, to fix to
fix this residue gauge freedom,

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:17.960
I have the freedom
to choose tau tilde

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:21.360
to be some combination of X.
And this is the combination

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.380
that we will choose.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.790
So this is what we call
the light-cone gauge.

01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:27.580
So I will suppress this tilde.

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:33.430
So in the light-cone gauge
means we go to a coordinate

01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:38.630
so that tau become equal to X
plus, and up to some constant

01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:40.270
which I called V plus.

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.320
OK.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.455
So V plus is some constant.

01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:49.740
Is this clear to you?

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:59.320
And this is so-called light-cone
coordinate in the target space.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:03.550
So this [INAUDIBLE] identify
the worldsheet's time

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:07.660
with the light-cone time
in the target space.

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:18.325
Or in other words, X plus
equal to V plus, tau.

01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:24.310
This is what we call
light-cone gauge.

01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:30.790
So why do we want to do that?

01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:34.580
And the ingenious
thing is the following.

01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:39.880
It's that if you
write X mu, so we

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:46.060
can write X mu as X
plus, X minus, and Xi.

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:49.570
And the i come from
2 to D minus 1.

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:52.850
So X plus and X
minus is X0 and X1.

01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:56.880
So that's right in this form.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.270
OK, then you can
easily check yourself,

01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:03.800
or you maybe already
know it, is that

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:10.690
this particular contraction
is given by 2X plus, X minus,

01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:12.020
plus Xi squared.

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:27.640
In particular [INAUDIBLE],
just as here, which you have

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.640
this off-diagonal structure.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.220
This kind of contraction has
this off-diagonal structure

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:34.850
in X plus and X minus.

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:38.480
And this turns out to be key.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.351
Yes.

01:32:39.351 --> 01:32:41.225
AUDIENCE: Do you mean
for that to be 0 and 1,

01:32:41.225 --> 01:32:42.970
and then that to be plus 1?

01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:44.000
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.900
AUDIENCE: Do you mean
for that to be 0 and 1?

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:50.990
HONG LIU: So these two are
equivalent to X0 and X1.

01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:53.170
Let me include
the rest, starting

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.338
from i equal to 2 to D minus 1.

01:32:59.330 --> 01:33:10.440
So X mu have X0, X1, then
what I would call Xi, which

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.190
i start from 2 to D minus 1.

01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:15.650
I just renamed these two
to be X plus and X minus.

01:33:15.650 --> 01:33:20.027
Just change this two
to X plus and X minus.

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:20.860
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.608
OK.

01:33:22.608 --> 01:33:24.096
HONG LIU: Yes?

01:33:24.096 --> 01:33:25.088
Yes.

01:33:25.088 --> 01:33:29.056
AUDIENCE: So when
we do another one,

01:33:29.056 --> 01:33:30.544
[? I thought ?]
the Weyl scaling's

01:33:30.544 --> 01:33:36.010
already fixed when you're
trying to fix [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.120
HONG LIU: No, no.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:44.050
I'm just saying I do these two
operation, but in sequence.

01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:46.939
So I do that operation, and
then I choose the Weyl scaling

01:33:46.939 --> 01:33:48.230
so that precisely cancels this.

01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:55.460
Of course, if you just
do a single Weyl scaling,

01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.800
this will be violated.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.630
But if I do that two
operation together,

01:33:59.630 --> 01:34:02.190
then this will be preserved.

01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:04.330
Yeah, I have to do
that two together.

01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:08.070
Yeah, if you do a single one,
this will be invalidated.

01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:10.830
OK, so this is the key point.

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:14.460
So we will see that this
structure will play a key role.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:18.012
So this is the smart thing
which our friend Jeffrey did.

01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:28.010
This is in fact the ingenious
thing of our friend Jeffrey

01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:29.450
and his friends [? did. ?]

01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:39.900
So now let's look at
these two equations, OK?

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.856
Now let's look at
these two equations.

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:51.325
So the first thing-- so now
let's look at 10 plus 11.

01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:08.890
So first let's note, because
of this, partial tau X

01:35:08.890 --> 01:35:14.770
plus is equal to V plus,
and partial sigma X

01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:17.890
plus is equal to 0.

01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:19.561
OK?

01:35:19.561 --> 01:35:21.310
Because there's no
sigma dependence there,

01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:25.730
only tau dependence,
which isn't in here.

01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:28.600
And then let me just plug it in.

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:31.730
So let's look at here.

01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:34.600
Let's forget about the 1/2.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.350
You can also think about
the 1/2, doesn't matter.

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:45.590
So look at plus and
minus structure here.

01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:46.285
Use this here.

01:35:49.700 --> 01:36:05.590
Then you get minus 2 V plus,
partial tau X minus, then

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:11.230
plus partial tau Xi squared.

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:14.570
This is for the first term.

01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:17.810
In the second term, the X
plus and the X minus part

01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:22.310
is 0 because of these.

01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:26.400
Because of this and because
of the off-diagonal structure

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:32.114
here, OK?

01:36:32.114 --> 01:36:34.140
Do you see it?

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:42.660
So the first term here would
be partial tau minus 2,

01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.730
partial sigma X
plus, partial sigma X

01:36:45.730 --> 01:36:51.870
minus plus partial
sigma Xi squared.

01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:54.840
So this would be 0.

01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:00.400
But our friend here is
0, because of that is 0.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.180
So now we can erase it.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.610
So now let's change
this to the other side.

01:37:05.610 --> 01:37:06.930
OK.

01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:08.430
Let's change this
to the other side,

01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:09.715
and then change this sign.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.930
So the equation I
get is the following.

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:24.600
OK, so this is equation 10.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.100
So now let's look
at equation 11.

01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:33.510
In 11, so we have
partial tau X plus,

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:37.410
then partial sigma X minus.

01:37:37.410 --> 01:37:43.497
Then you go to partial tau
Xi and partial sigma Xi.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.790
And then this one
just give us V plus.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.113
So that two equation
become these two equation.

01:37:57.113 --> 01:37:58.112
And let me call this 14.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.160
This is 15.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.850
So is it clear to
you, these equations?

01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:15.280
So if it's not immediately clear
to you, just check it yourself.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:15.780
OK.

01:38:18.850 --> 01:38:23.520
Urge you to do the
check, because then you

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:25.400
will see the magic.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:30.635
Then you will see the magic
and the beauty of this trick.

01:38:30.635 --> 01:38:31.551
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:43.168
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:38:43.168 --> 01:38:46.230
AUDIENCE: Can you tell X minus
[INAUDIBLE] sigma X plus?

01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:51.240
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's 0
because partial 0 X plus is 0.

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.780
So that's why there's
only one here, not two.

01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:56.440
Because the other term is 0.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.650
OK, so now the beauty
of these two equation

01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:08.070
is that they express the X
minus solely in terms of Xi.

01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:27.006
So 14 and 15 tells you, is that
X minus can be fully solved

01:39:27.006 --> 01:39:32.180
in terms of Xi.

01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:41.940
Because this equation give you
the tau derivative of X minus,

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:46.100
this equation give you the
sigma derivative of X minus,

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:50.810
and all expressed
only in terms of Xi.

01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:57.890
So the X minus is completely
solved, completely expressed,

01:39:57.890 --> 01:40:00.160
in terms of Xi.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.470
And then we have solved those
constraints [? similarly ?]

01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:10.640
[INAUDIBLE] constraint
explicitly, OK?

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.660
So right now we are doing
it a little bit fast.

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:15.650
I urge you to go through the
algebra yourself to appreciate

01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:18.980
the beauty of this step.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:30.310
So we conclude that independent
degrees freedoms are only Xi.

01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:43.090
Because X plus we already
know by fixing the gauge.

01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:47.530
And X minus now is completely
solving in terms of Xi,

01:40:47.530 --> 01:40:51.900
so the independent
freedom are only Xi's.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:56.470
And this will make
our life very easy.

01:40:56.470 --> 01:41:01.820
Because Xi are just
free scalar fields.

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:06.980
Xi-- just free scalar field
with the right kinetic term.

01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:10.690
You have also get rid of
X0, because we said that

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.935
[? before ?] X0, we have a
[? long-sign ?] kinetic term.

01:41:13.935 --> 01:41:15.810
But now we are only
independent-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:20.140
only Xi's, and they have the
right number of kinetic terms.

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.480
They have the right sign
for the kinetic term.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.260
And they are just
free scalar fields.

01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:29.560
So we can quantize
them as what you

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:34.530
did in your first day of
Quantum Field Theory class.

01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:38.310
And then you have quantized
the string theory.

01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:40.690
And then you have
quantized string theory.

01:41:40.690 --> 01:41:43.640
OK, yeah.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.180
I think I'm going
very slow here.

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.770
Maybe I'm a little
bit too emotional.

01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.420
Anyway, so maybe
let's stop here.

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.400
The next time, then we will
just quantize those things.

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.390
And those equations
still will give us

01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:09.900
some very important
information, and then we

01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.280
will quantize those things.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.550
And then we will be able to see
that the string theory contains

01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:17.470
gravity.

01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:20.290
It contains gravitons, OK?

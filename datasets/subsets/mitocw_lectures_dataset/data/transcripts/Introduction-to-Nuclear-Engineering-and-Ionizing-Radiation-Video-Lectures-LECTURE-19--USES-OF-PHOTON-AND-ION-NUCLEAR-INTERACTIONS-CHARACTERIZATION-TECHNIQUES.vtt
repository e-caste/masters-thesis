MICHAEL SHORT:
Anyway, today is going

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.380
to be a lot lighter than the
past few days, which have been

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.760
heavy on theory and new stuff.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.530
And I want to focus
today on what can you

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.580
do with the photon and ion
interactions with matter.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.330
So we're going to go
through a whole bunch

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.940
of different analytical
and materials

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.580
characterization techniques
that use the stuff that we've

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.745
been learning and see
what you can actually do.

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:44.120
And I'll be drawing
from examples

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.340
from the open literature,
from textbooks,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.430
and from my own work.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.470
So stuff I was doing
here on my PhD thesis

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.620
is actually a direct result of
what do we do here in 22.01.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.433
So a quick review just to get
it all on the board of what

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.350
we've been looking at.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.459
So I don't hit
anyone on the way in.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:15.350
We talked about different photon
interactions, which include

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.580
the photoelectric effect.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.110
Let's say this
will be the energy

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.910
of the scattered whatever, and
this will be its cross section.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.430
We talked about
Compton scattering.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.297
We talked about pair production.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.500
For the photoelectric effect,
the energy of the photoelectron

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.620
comes off like the
energy of the gamma

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.220
ray minus some very small
difference, the binding

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.050
energy of the electron.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.730
Let's just call it Eb.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.523
And this effect starts
when you hit what's

00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:57.565
called the work function.

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:02.380
I'm just going to put
this all up there,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.390
so when we explain the
analytical techniques,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.430
we can point to
different bits of this

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.189
and explain why we use
these different things.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.480
The cross-section, I made
sure to keep this handy,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.830
so I don't want to lose it.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.930
Strongly proportional with z.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.350
So the cross-section
comes out of another line.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.540
What was it proportional to?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.330
Oh yeah, this is nuts.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.160
It's like z to the fifth
over energy to the 7/2,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.860
which says that for
higher z materials,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.800
the photoelectron yield
is much, much stronger,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.340
and it's way more likely
that way lower energy.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.140
So you can imagine
if you wanted to use

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.240
this in an analytical
technique, and you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.610
want to study which
photoelectrons come from which

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.570
elements, you might think to use
a low energy photon to excite

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.410
them, not a high energy photon,
because like we had done

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.180
a couple of times
before, if we draw

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.295
our energy versus major
cross-section range,

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:07.670
we had a graph that looks
something like this, where this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.878
was the photoelectric effect.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.230
This was Compton scattering.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.240
This is pair production.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.007
And so by knowing what energy--

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:21.590
oh, I'm sorry.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.850
That's supposed to be z.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.840
And this would give you
the dominant process

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.990
that each the combination
of energy and z.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.540
So if you know what
energy photons you've got

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.120
and what you're looking
for, well, there you go.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.620
Let's see.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.367
What was the energy of
the Compton electron?

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:43.700
Remember the wavelength formula.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.470
It was like alpha 1
minus cosine theta over--

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.145
let's see.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.170
Another 1 minus cosine theta.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.320
In came the gamma ray energy.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.378
What was the part
that came beforehand?

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:09.170
That's why I have this
here because I don't

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.378
want to write anything wrong.

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:14.605
It's good to have it
all up there at once.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.290
1.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.090
Yeah.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.200
That's all I was missing.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.370
Cool.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.160
And the cross-section
for Compton scattering

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.300
scaled something like z over
energy, something pretty

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.090
simple, not nearly as
strong as pair production

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.740
or photoelectric
effect, so you can

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.050
think Compton scattering
happens much more

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.360
dominantly at low
z or the other two

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.945
don't really happen
that much at low

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.540
z, whichever way you
want to think of it.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.900
And for pair production, you
get a whole mess of stuff.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.210
You get positrons coming out.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.860
You get a bunch of
511 keV gamma rays

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.350
and all sorts of other
things you can detect.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.820
And the cross-section,
this one's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.460
got the funny scaling term.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.440
This one, yeah.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.800
It's like z squared log.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.470
Energy over mec squared, so some
z squared kind of dependence.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.580
So let's keep those up for now.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.250
Let's get the electron ones in.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
mez squared?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.860
MICHAEL SHORT: Was it z squared?

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.600
Let me check.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.830
No, that's a c.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.583
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:41.670
Yeah, just make sure
that's clearly a c squared.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.860
So now let's call
it charged particle,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.520
or just more generally
ion electron interactions.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.030
Since these are more
fresh in our head,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.770
what are the three
ways in which charged

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.730
particles can interact with
matter that we talked about?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.110
Just rattle off any one of them.

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:09.320
AUDIENCE: Bremsstrahlung?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.362
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
Bremsstrahlung or radiative.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.968
What else?

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:25.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.160
MICHAEL SHORT: Is what?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.035
AUDIENCE: Ionization.

00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:28.146
MICHAEL SHORT: Ionization.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.470
Which we'll call
inelastic collisions.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.187
And?

00:06:39.187 --> 00:06:40.520
AUDIENCE: Rutherford scattering.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.644
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
Rutherford scattering.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.220
Which are kind of elastic
or hard sphere collisions.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.970
And if we had to make
kind of a table of when

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.340
do we care about
which effect, let's

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.680
say this was an ion or
electron, scattering off

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.590
of either electrons or nuclei,
in either elastic or inelastic

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.090
ways.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.640
First of all, when
do we actually

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.550
care about elastic
scattering off

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.820
of electrons, which would be
hard sphere collisions off

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.570
of electrons?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.900
To help get you going,
in an elastic collision,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.310
the maximum energy transfer
can be this formula gamma

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.370
times the incoming
energy, where gamma

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.780
is 4 times the incoming mass
times the mass of whatever

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.725
you're hitting over
n plus big m squared.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:55.930
Let's say if one of these
masses was mass of an electron.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.635
What is gamma approximately
equal for most cases?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.750
Well, let's say this was
like electrons scattering off

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.540
of protons or vice versa.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.130
How much energy
could an electron

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.540
transfer to a proton in
an elastic collision?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.610
Basically zero.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.600
The only time which
this actually matters

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.220
is if it's an electron hitting
another electron, in which case

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.860
you can have pretty
significant energy transfer.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.270
So I'd say for elastic
collisions off of electrons,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.830
you only care about those
for other electrons.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.290
And I'm going to put in
low energy electrons.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.930
Why do we only care about
them for low energy electrons?

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.530
Or in other words, what are the
other methods of stopping power

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.850
or interaction-- yeah, Chris.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.562
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:55.562 --> 00:08:56.520
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.270
Yep.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.920
We already saw
that Bremsstrahlung

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.700
the radiated power scales
with something like z

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.120
squared over m squared.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.270
So with a really small
mass and a really high z

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.870
and also a higher
energy, you end up

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.240
radiating most of that power
away as Bremsstrahlung.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.810
And there's not much of a
chance of elastic collision.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.120
So we only care about
low energy electrons

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.660
when it comes to elastic
collisions with electrons.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.410
For inelastic collisions
with electrons,

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.210
well, that's the hollow
cylinder derivation

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.280
that we had done
from before where

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:38.010
you have some particle with a
mass m and a charge little ze,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.990
getting slightly deflected
by feeling the pull--

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.020
depending on what charge it is,
it could be towards or away--

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.340
of that electron away from
some impact parameter B.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.090
So we care about this
pretty much all the time.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.040
Electrons and ions or
stripped bare nuclei

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.290
actually matter in this case.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.287
For elastic collisions
off of nuclei,

00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:05.870
this is what Rutherford
scattering is.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.810
It's a simple hard simple
hard sphere collisions,

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.530
so this matters pretty
much all the time.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.030
What about inelastic
collisions with nuclei?

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.545
What does an inelastic collision
actually mean with a nucleus?

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.360
So fusion could be one of them,
but let's go more generally.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.290
We have some nuclear reaction,
where it's the old thing

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.880
that I keep drawing all the time
of some little nucleus striking

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.950
a large nucleus.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.630
In an inelastic
collision, this is

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.170
the case we haven't
considered yet,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.130
but I want to show you
what actually happens.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.280
In an inelastic collision,
these two nuclei

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.580
join together to
form what's called

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.450
a compound nucleus
or CN, at which point

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.420
it breaks apart
in some other way.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.990
So there might be some
different small particle

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.770
and some different large
particle coming off.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.300
But in an inelastic
collision, it's

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.360
almost like the incoming
particle is absorbed

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.820
and something else
is readmitted.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.580
It could be that same particle
at a different energy,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.500
and it could be a different
energy altogether.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.360
So yeah, I'd say
fusion is an example.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.417
It's kicked off by an
inelastic collision,

00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:23.500
because you've got to have
some sort of absorption

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.560
event of the small nucleus
by the big nucleus.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.480
And then, maybe if it fuses
and just stays that way,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.960
it releases a ton of
its binding energy,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.700
well, that's pretty cool.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.900
So these actually
do matter, but not

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.330
for all energies in all cases.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.920
So let's go back to the Janis
database of cross-sections

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.170
to see when inelastic
scattering actually matters.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.895
Bring us back to normal size.

00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:57.200
And we'll look at some
of the cross-sections

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.490
to see when do we actually care
about inelastic scattering?

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.620
So we haven't selected
a database yet.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.310
Let's say we're firing
protons at things.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.190
And pick a database
that actually

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.710
has some elements listed.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.340
Not a lot.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.310
But iron, that works.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.490
So we can look at the difference
between the elastic scattering

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:26.410
cross-section and the
anything cross-section.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.260
So the red curve here--

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.950
can I make it thicker easily?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.630
Probably.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.380
Yeah, I can make it
thicker pretty easily.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.160
Easier to see.

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:41.595
Plots.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.588
Wait.

00:12:47.588 --> 00:12:48.630
That's not what I wanted.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.588
I'm not going to mess
around with this anymore.

00:12:50.588 --> 00:12:52.070
Do you guys see the two lines?

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.310
OK, so this is the elastic
scattering cross-section.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.198
Kind of funny to
see it negative.

00:12:57.198 --> 00:12:59.240
But then there's the
anything cross-section which

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.930
picks up at around 3 MeV or so.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.540
And it usually takes
somewhere between 1 and 10 MeV

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.050
for inelastic scattering
to quote unquote turn on,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.460
and that's because
you have to be

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.450
able to excite the nucleus
to some next energy level.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.900
So sending in a proton
at like 0.01 MeV

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.900
is not going to excite any
of the internal particles

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.030
to a higher energy level.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.800
So if you want to see some
pretty interesting cases,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.280
let's go to incident
neutron data

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.690
where we have a
ton of this data.

00:13:32.377 --> 00:13:33.710
And I'll show you some examples.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.350
We've got lots more
data for neutrons.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.320
So now we can look at some
of these cross-sections.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.390
Like this z n prime.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.400
Let's take a look at
what that looks like.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.680
That means a neutron comes in.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.030
Different neutron comes out.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.970
Notice that the scale
only starts at 862 keV.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.030
So let's make it something else.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.540
Oh my.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.340
Look at that.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.720
Nothing going on until you
reach almost 1 MeV, which means,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.400
hey, inelastic
scattering doesn't really

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.330
turn on until that.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.140
So I would say that
this can matter,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:23.680
but for higher
energy collisions.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.170
So yeah, it matters
pretty much all the time.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.750
But higher energy collisions.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.950
And there's actually-- yeah.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.908
AUDIENCE: What does it
say in the top left box?

00:14:31.908 --> 00:14:33.970
MICHAEL SHORT: Only for
low energy electrons.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.060
That's the sort of compound
reason that I and Chris said,

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.790
one, is that you can't
transfer much mass

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.560
in an elastic
collision, or I'm sorry,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.540
much energy in an
elastic collision

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.300
unless the masses are
close enough to each other.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.330
And two, at higher
energies, the electron

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.240
radiates Bremsstrahlung
much, much, much faster.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.900
As we saw at around
10 MeV, Bremsstrahlung

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.720
and inelastic scattering give
about equal contributions

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.220
to the stopping power for
high z materials like lead.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.340
So once you're down and
let's say like the keV range,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.980
yeah, electron elastic
collisions might matter.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.230
So we talked about those three.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.243
Now I think we can launch
into the analytical technique.

00:15:20.243 --> 00:15:22.660
So for the rest of the lecture
today, it's all going to be

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.577
what can you do with the
stuff that we've been

00:15:24.577 --> 00:15:26.620
learning since the first exam.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.000
I know it hasn't
been long since,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.550
but we've actually
learned a ton.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.973
And I want to show you
what's actually possible.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.640
And this is not going
to be with slides.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.650
It's all live from
websites that I'd

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.290
love for you guys to be able to
follow along with or check out

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.430
at home.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.160
So I'm going to show
you an awesome resource

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.550
through the MIT libraries
and how to get there.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.300
If you go to
vera.mit.edu, there's

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.502
a great tool called
the ASM Handbook.

00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:52.960
You can see I've
been there before.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.890
There's the ASM
handbooks online,

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.660
and this is kind of
that's everything

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.180
to know about material
science, metallurgy,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.520
and analytical techniques,
absolutely everything

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.700
from corrosion to fractography,
to characterization,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.340
to structure of materials
to where you can find

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.490
every single alloy, to
binary phase diagrams of how

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.980
things mix, and we're going to
head to one of these handbooks.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.280
Number nine or 10,
materials characterization,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.920
because with the stuff
that's on this board,

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.980
you can understand how most
materials characterization

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.450
techniques work.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.290
And I want to show
you a few of them.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.190
One of which-- no, two of
which, we're going to demo

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.850
out next Friday's recitation.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.600
So I think I told you
guys in the syllabus

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.310
and probably in
person that we're

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.990
going to try out some
scanning electron

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.950
microscopy and some energy
dispersive X-ray or EDC

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.280
analysis.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.640
So with the X-ray transition
stuff you've learned,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.400
you actually know how
to elementally analyze

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.690
different materials.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.430
And with scanning
electron microscope,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.360
you can get some idea about how
electrons can make images much

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.880
better than optical images.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:08.630
So let's head to electron
optical methods, scanning

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:15.310
electron microscopy, and show
you what one of these things

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.420
actually looks like.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:22.609
Let's take a look at an SEM, or
scanning electron microscope.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:26.160
So up at the top, there is a
device called the electron gun.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.500
For now, just imagine it's
a source of electrons,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.000
but in a few minutes,
we'll actually

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.460
explain how it works
using the principle

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.790
of thermionic emission, which
we talked about last Friday.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.110
You've got some
electronic lenses,

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.740
some focusing coils, that
caused this beam to get

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.840
focused further and further.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.800
So let's say you had this
electron filament giving off

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.050
electrons in all directions.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.400
When you see boxes with x's
like this on an electron optics

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.250
diagram, it usually means
this is like a focusing coil

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.510
of some sort.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.910
So that will cause the electrons
to get bent and focused.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:09.430
There'll be another set of
coils that focuses them further

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.140
and some scanning coils
that actually raster or xy

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.430
scan this beam across the
surface of a material.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.440
And so in this way,
what you're actually

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.870
doing is putting the
electron beam at one

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.270
part of your material and
then with another detector,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.110
let's call it a secondary
electron detector.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.290
Looking at the electrons
produced from collisions

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.190
with those other electrons
that then get detected here,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.680
and the number of electrons
produced at a point

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.020
gives you the
brightness of the image.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.540
That's kind of as simple
as it is despite how

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.670
complicated this diagram looks.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.500
There's an electron source.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.570
There's coils that
scan it back and forth.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.660
Like has anyone ever seen
the old cathode ray tube,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.620
CRT televisions?

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.880
There's going to come a
day when that answer is no.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.255
And I'm kind of
worried for that,

00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:01.800
because that's the day
I'll officially become old.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.853
But for now,
everyone's seen a CRT,

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.270
and the way that
actually works is

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.600
there's an electron gun that
fires and scans left to right

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.920
and up to down our rasters and
produces that electron image.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.480
In an SEM, you use an electron
gun, kind of similar, and then

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.930
collect the electrons generated
in the specimen, what's

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.880
called secondary electrons.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.860
And the number that
you see gives you

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.810
the brightness of the image.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.940
The cool thing is
this actually allows

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.560
you to look at both
secondary electron contrast

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.680
and topology of a sample.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.530
So let's say this was your
secondary electron detector.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.680
And you had an electron beam
scanning across your sample

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.710
to some of those
peaks and valleys.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.810
And I'll probably draw one
right here for a good reason.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.050
Let's say the electrons
hit right here,

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.330
and you send out a wave
of secondary electrons.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.450
The material partly determines
how many electrons come off,

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.550
but also, so does the geometry.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.160
There will usually
be a little cage

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.220
with some sort of a
positive voltage on it

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.980
to attract those
secondary electrons.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.740
And some of them will curve into
the detector and become part

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.000
of your signal, but
some of them won't.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.390
Meanwhile, if you have this
beam right here producing

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.450
secondary electrons,
pretty much all of them

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.640
go slamming into your detector.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.620
And that's what actually
allows the electron

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.960
microscope to get topology.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.470
That's why images in
the SEM look fairly 3D.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.490
So I want to show you a few
examples from my own boredom

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.450
when I was doing
a lot of science.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.950
There we go.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.510
I have a whole
gallery of SEM images

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.730
when I was supposed to be
doing something better.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:56.300
Oh no.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.490
404.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.450
My website's broken.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:07.950
Oh yeah.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.033
This is also what you do
when you're bored, right?

00:21:10.033 --> 00:21:13.690
Make your own 404 page.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.610
My SEM galleries are dead.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.510
Well, that's OK.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.370
I have other images
ready to show you guys.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.380
So this is a neat-- this is
a paper that I published out

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.750
of my PhD work that
shows the real difference

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.530
between optical and
electron microscopy.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.190
Part of it is the limit
of your resolution

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.610
depends on the wavelength or de
Broglie wavelength of the thing

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.470
you're using to make the image.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.960
So an optical
microscope, in this case,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.290
you can't get better resolution
than about half a micron,

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.150
because even the blue
wavelengths of light

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.510
are getting down into about
the 450 nanometer regime.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.210
And it's very difficult
without interference techniques

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.720
or other fancy things to
beat that diffraction limit,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.570
to beat the sort of wavelength
limit of optical microscopy.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.650
So this is a 500x
optical microscope image,

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.690
and you can see these
little fingers--

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.610
in this case, it's
liquid lead bismuth

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.920
penetrating into
a stainless steel

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.170
that we were doing
corrosion experiments on.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.700
And that's as good
as the image can

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.220
get in an optical microscope.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.040
Switch down to an SEM,
and then all of a sudden

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.740
the picture becomes much,
much, much more clear.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.920
You can start to see things--
the best SEM we have in our lab

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.600
has an ultimate resolution
of about 1 nanometer.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.510
Now, resolution is
kind of a funny thing.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.760
It's neat to tell
you what that means.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.530
It doesn't mean that if
you have a pattern of lines

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:47.540
that are exactly one nanometer
thick, that you will see them

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.060
as lines 1 nanometer thick.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.950
It means that if
you then plot, let's

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:58.710
say, your signal or your
brightness versus x,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.820
you'll have some barely
distinguishable and fuzzy

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.600
lines, just enough for you to
say those are two optically

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.980
distinct features.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:14.340
So what you'll actually see
in a 1 nanometer microscope

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.850
is maybe something like this.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.790
That's technically resolved
at the level of 1 nanometer.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.250
So the best you can do for
crisp objects in this thing

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.260
is about 20 nanometers.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.430
Not bad.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.250
It's like something that's a
few thousand atoms on a side.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.420
Pretty cool.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.260
And so what you can see in
here is liquid lead bismuth

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.900
penetrating into
this stainless steel,

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.970
and you notice a few
different things.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.770
This image was taken in
backscatter electron mode.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.160
Back scattering is-- we've
talked about this before.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.140
When you have a scattering
event where theta equals pi,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.820
we call that backscatter.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:10.410
Let's kind of split this
into regular and backscatter.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.560
For a backscattering, the
cross-section for this

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.580
is proportional to z
squared, another one

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.000
of those extremely z dependent
cross-sections, which

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.540
means that the larger the z,
the higher the atomic number

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.090
the more backscatter
contrast you get,

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.240
so if you want to figure out
where the little lead whiskers

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.520
are penetrating into
the stainless steel,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.650
since lead has a z of like 82,
and iron has a z of like 26,

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.435
it shows up like night and day.

00:24:43.435 --> 00:24:45.340
Do you have a question, Julia?

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.347
OK.

00:24:46.347 --> 00:24:48.680
Yeah, so this is something
we'll actually be able to do.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.840
So for the two folks I
asked to bring in samples,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.270
if you want to bring
in something with very

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.310
different elements
in it, we should

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.350
be able to see it in backscatter
contrast very, very clearly.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.950
And in the image of the
SEM, I'll go back to that--

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.190
which one of these pages is it?

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.520
Notice here that there is
a backscatter detector.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.740
So it will detect which
of those electrons

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.110
scatter back at
almost 180 degrees.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.090
And that's at about z squared
proportionality, super useful

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.110
tool, because if you want
to see, for example, where

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.860
the circuit board
traces are, and you want

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.420
to look at aluminum
versus oxygen contrast,

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.210
that'll help you really well.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.160
If you want to see where
is lead penetrating

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.572
into stainless steel, it
shines up clear as day,

00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:38.020
which is pretty fun.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.700
The other thing
the electrons will

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.410
do when they enter
into a material

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.260
is excite lots of things.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.470
So anything from X-rays
to Auger electrons.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.440
So now I'd like to bring up
Auger electron spectroscopy.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.380
Electron or X-ray
spectroscopic methods.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.030
Auger electron
spectroscopy, it's

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.220
not just a thing to
trip you up on the exam

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.360
or a little minutia
from radioactive decay.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.020
It's actually incredibly
useful, because

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.080
of where the Auger
electrons are generated

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.650
and what they tell you
about the material.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.790
So as a quick refresher,
normally you could have,

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:23.140
let's say, if a photon comes
in and injects a photo electron

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.620
as another electron
comes to fill that hole,

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.160
either an X-ray will be
emitted or an Auger electron

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.270
will be emitted.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.920
And it's those Auger
electrons, they're

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.540
outer binding energy electrons.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.770
They have very low binding
energy, which means--

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.280
let's see.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.752
I keep running out of room.

00:26:41.752 --> 00:26:43.210
You know, I'm not
going to draw it.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.090
I'm going to show you, because I
know there is a diagram of what

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.890
I want to show you here.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.800
If you want to see where the
Auger electrons are actually

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.630
produced in the material--

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.090
here we go.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.210
Since they're such low energy,
the only Auger electrons

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.620
that actually get out would be
in this outer few mono layers.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.510
In fact, there's some
Auger electron energies

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.180
that can only get out
one or two atomic mono

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.780
layers from a material.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.840
So it's one of the
best surface analysis

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.460
techniques that we have.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.730
You can both use Auger electrons
to make an electron image,

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.100
like any other SEM.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.930
And you can collect them
and measure their energy

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.490
to figure out which
elements they came from.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.070
And this kind of
teardrop shape is a--

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.740
one, it's a great synthesis
of all the information

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.560
you need to know in the SEM
that we'll see on Friday.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.060
And two, its why people
screw up SEM analysis a lot.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.660
A lot of the X-ray
excitation happens down here.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.100
Why do you think that the
X-ray exaltation would happen

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.873
near the end of the path
of the electron beam

00:27:49.873 --> 00:27:51.540
from what you know
about stopping power?

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.150
Or, if I asked you to
draw a graph of let's say

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:10.800
energy versus stopping power
for ionization, what would

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.400
it look like?

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.910
Yeah.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.779
AUDIENCE: It comes up
like a peak at low energy.

00:28:19.779 --> 00:28:20.612
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:28:20.612 --> 00:28:22.450
AUDIENCE: And then
drops back down.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.283
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:28:23.283 --> 00:28:26.322
AUDIENCE: And as the energy goes
out, it sort of flattens out.

00:28:26.322 --> 00:28:28.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
sort of flattens out,

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.940
and then eventually starts
picking up again but not very

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.970
much.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.632
So as the energy of
whatever you're going into--

00:28:35.632 --> 00:28:37.090
I'm sorry, whatever
particle you're

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.120
sending in it gets lower,
it's stopping power increases,

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.310
and you have a much higher
chance of this ionization

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.740
happening, especially in
the case of electrons.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.923
They usually come in at
between 10 and 40 kV.

00:28:48.923 --> 00:28:50.340
And so near the
end of their range

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.870
is where they produce
a lot of the X-rays.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.520
Now there's a lot
of other nuances

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.790
to say, well, which
X-rays were produced here

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.930
and what elements are they from.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:06.350
Let's say you had the same
material here or here.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.600
Fewer X-rays will get
out of the bottom region

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.330
than they will from
the top region.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.080
So if you happen to
be analyzing something

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.080
that has a gradient
in composition

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.110
or a change in composition
from the top to the bottom,

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.830
you might be like, oh, well,
I have a few nanometers

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.050
of oxygen on silicon.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.480
Why aren't I seeing
any oxygen X-rays?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.380
Because you're probably
generating them down here.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.150
That's one of those
things to note.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.040
So sometimes you'll
see and elect

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.362
an elemental map of
things that shows X-rays

00:29:38.362 --> 00:29:40.070
of certain element
coming from somewhere,

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.930
and you can't see it
at all in the image.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.460
That's because they
might be underneath what

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.600
you can see in the image.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.945
It's kind of tricky like that.

00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:49.070
I'll show you some examples
of what those maps look

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:53.850
like also from this paper.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.820
So from the electron
image, we sort of

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.310
concluded, all right, lead
is probably penetrating

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.050
into the stainless steel.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.700
How do we know for sure?

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.970
You can make EDX or
elemental dispersive--

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.670
I'm sorry, energy
dispersive X-ray maps

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.310
by focusing the electron
beam at one point,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.810
collecting all the
different X-rays

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.870
and then moving from
one point to another

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.630
to see when do you get
characteristic X-rays from each

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.870
of those elements.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.360
So you can actually
prove to say,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.550
yes, those little fingers
are indeed bismuth and lead,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.220
and you can see that, in this
case, where the lead in bismuth

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.140
is, the iron is not.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.520
But the curious
thing we found is

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.580
that in this whole band right
here, most of the chromium

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.870
disappeared.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.540
So it turns out that
the corrosion mechanism

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.340
was chromium dissolution.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.730
And we would not have been able
to know that without this EDX

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.370
mapping, and without
understanding how the EDX

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.550
maps are made from the electrons
interacting with matter

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.820
and producing
characteristic X-rays,

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.190
wouldn't have been
able to prove this.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.920
Yet another example
where the basic stuff

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.090
you're learning in 22.01 is
the theoretical underpinning

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.190
of the techniques that
we use all the time

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:09.106
in material science, which
I thought was pretty cool.

00:31:09.106 --> 00:31:11.080
I've got more
examples of that that

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.570
are even more
striking, because I let

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.840
it collect for a little longer.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.200
You can actually see right
here that where the bismuth is,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.340
the iron isn't, but the
iron's not dissolving.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.120
The chromium is.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.590
It's just the lead
and bismuth are

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.080
kind of sucking the chromium
out of the metal right there,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.860
and that's what making the
stainless steel less stainless.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.700
It's pretty neat.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.540
Then on to EDX analysis,
what sort of information

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.960
are we looking at every
one of these pixels?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.400
I have a couple of other
example X-ray spectra.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.090
So now we're in a
position to understand

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.420
why one of these X-ray
spectra looks the way it does.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.580
In this case, we're firing
electrons at a material.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.260
Let's see.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.600
Where is our material
we're firing at?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.250
Right here.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.010
So we're firing in electrons.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.280
And in some cases, let's
say we had an iron atom.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:13.998
That electron can
eject another electron.

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:15.540
And then one of
those other electrons

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.270
will fall down in
that shell, giving off

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.100
a characteristic X-ray.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.250
In this case, since it's from
the third to the second shell,

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.550
that would be what we call
an L X-ray or a something

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.310
to level two transition.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.010
And every element has got
its characteristic X-ray

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:36.840
transitions, like we saw on the
NIST X-ray transition database.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.820
And since we know
what all of those are,

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.200
we know where to expect them.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.320
So we know where we expect
to see chromium's X-rays

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.420
and iron's X-rays.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.190
Gold's kind of an
interesting one.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.150
There's two things about
doing analysis with gold.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.400
A lot of times you have to
coat your materials in gold

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.830
to boost their secondary
electron contrast.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.820
But also gold, I think
it's its L line or M line,

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.643
I forget which one, is the
same as argon's K line.

00:33:06.643 --> 00:33:08.810
And we have an expression
in the electron microscopy

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.960
world, the probability of
finding argon in your sample

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.420
decreases with experience.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.135
Takes a second to parse that.

00:33:17.135 --> 00:33:19.260
Chances are, if you're
looking at a solid material.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.790
You don't have argon in it.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.940
But there are extra lines
that overlap with each other,

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.330
like the L line for gold
and the K line for argon

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.110
are at pretty much the
same energy, certainly

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.920
similar enough that it's
within the resolution

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.908
or like full width of half
maximum of these two peaks.

00:33:38.908 --> 00:33:40.950
So remember how we were
analyzing the uncertainty

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.190
of our banana spectra with
the FWHM or full width

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.432
at half maximum?

00:33:45.432 --> 00:33:46.890
Same thing here,
and you can really

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.710
see that the energy
resolution of this detector

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.740
is not the best.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.450
So if you see a
peak, it might be

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.672
due to two or more peaks
crowding in that right there.

00:33:58.672 --> 00:34:01.130
And with a lot of correction
factors that I won't get into,

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.930
you can then use
this information

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.760
to integrate the area
under these peaks

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.920
and get elemental analysis.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.300
You can say how much chromium
or how much iron and silicon is

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.400
in one of these samples.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.545
What's this stuff
here on the bottom?

00:34:16.545 --> 00:34:17.170
Anyone tell me?

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.484
That continuum of
observed X-ray energies?

00:34:27.906 --> 00:34:28.810
AUDIENCE: Compton.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.360
MICHAEL SHORT: Compton
scattering is a photon effect,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.250
so that would be--

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.500
if this were a photon
analysis spectrum, then

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.170
you would see something like
this but of a different shape.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.719
You'd have that Compton
bowl with an edge.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.429
But this is, in
this case, electrons

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.630
interacting with material.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.896
What do you think is causing
that broad background?

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.880
Well, what are the different
ways in which electrons

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.460
can interact with matter?

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.923
You're seeing the
ionizations here.

00:35:00.923 --> 00:35:02.840
We're not really seeing
Rutherford scattering.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.725
What's left?

00:35:05.725 --> 00:35:07.120
AUDIENCE: Bremsstrahlung?

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.370
MICHAEL SHORT: Bremsstrahlung.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.920
Yep, that's exactly it.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.610
So the observed
Bremsstrahlung spectrum

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.550
follows this sort of
characteristic peak

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.350
early and then tail off curve.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.530
What's the actual
Bremsstrahlung spectrum

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.595
that we're not sensing?

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.790
What would it look like?

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:33.000
Always running out of room.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.040
If this is what we're
actually observing,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.730
let's say we have a few peeks,
that would be intensity,

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.183
and that would be energy, what's
really going on physically

00:35:45.183 --> 00:35:46.100
that we're not seeing?

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.254
Yeah.

00:35:51.254 --> 00:35:56.670
AUDIENCE: Isn't it sort of like
almost like exponential decay.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.260
So it starts out with very
high intensity and goes down.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.330
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:07.144
You actually should get more
low energy Bremsstrahlung.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.610
One of some of the
reasons you don't is

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.940
that the lower energy,
those X-rays come out,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.350
the more they get self-absorbed
in the material in the few gas

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.710
molecules in the SEM and in
the window of the detector.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.210
So just because
this is what you see

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.710
doesn't mean this
is what's actually

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.560
going on in your material.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.840
If we think back then to where
the electrons and X-rays are

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.253
generated, the X-rays that
are generated down here,

00:36:36.253 --> 00:36:38.420
the lower energy ones are
going to be shielded more.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.300
And this kind of messes up
your elemental analysis,

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.500
because if the
X-rays produced here,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.690
proportionally more
of the low energy

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.300
ones will get out than
the ones produced here.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.030
So as you change your--

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.070
as you change your
electron beam energy,

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.040
you might see your elemental
composition appear to change

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.858
when you know it's really not.

00:36:59.858 --> 00:37:02.150
And that's because where the
X-rays are being generated

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.180
change, and proportionately,
more of the low energy

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.120
ones get self shielded
by your material.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.010
So you actually have
to correct for that

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.070
and input your beam energy
into the EDX analyzer

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.660
so it knows how to
correct for this.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.790
But with the understanding
I've been giving you

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.400
guys in this class you
can understand like well,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.700
why can you get screwed up?

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.820
Why do we have to have all
these correction factors?

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.090
I think it's pretty neat.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.600
Then let's get on to some of the
other methods, like X-ray photo

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.020
electron spectroscopy or XPS.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.770
This is something I
hinted to a little bit

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.430
earlier that actually uses
the photoelectric effect,

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.130
because it's a photo
electron spectroscopy method.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.900
This one's incredibly useful
because not only does it

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.670
tell you what
elements are there,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.650
but in what binding
state they are,

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.420
because photo
electron spectrometers

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.760
can be incredibly precise.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.810
The energy equation should
look pretty familiar to you

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.700
it's whatever photo
electron you get

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.290
is the gamma ray
energy that comes

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.980
in minus the binding
energy of that electron

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.600
and the work function.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.210
And so you can very,
very simply figure out

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.580
for a given element
and a given electron

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.720
shell what photo electron
energy's do you expect.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.030
So you can collect them.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.100
So I'll show you another
example from this paper, where

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.700
we started to do that.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.970
We wanted to answer
the question, what

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:32.390
are the oxides forming
on the stainless steel

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.130
when lead corrodes it?

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:36.140
And just telling
you which elements

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.150
are there and in what
proportion doesn't give

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.980
the answer, because
what if there's

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.810
multiple phases of each oxide?

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:53.490
Like, for example, iron can take
forms like FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4,

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:57.108
and this FeO can actually have
a range of stoichiometries.

00:38:57.108 --> 00:38:57.900
So how do you know?

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:58.650
You don't know.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.237
There could be like scores
of phases of this iron oxide.

00:39:02.237 --> 00:39:04.320
The question is how you
know which ones are there.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.350
The photo electrons
will tell you.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:12.870
So what you can do first is fire
monochromatic X-rays, so single

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:17.520
energy X-rays, in this case
from aluminum at your material

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.330
and see which photo electrons
of which energy come off.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.090
And you can tell
which atomic shell

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.460
they're from and which
elements they should

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.530
be to a very high precision.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:33.390
In this case, this is done
to 100 milli MeV or 0.1 MeV

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.360
precision, 0.1 eV precision.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.790
So we can tell not only
what elements are there,

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.430
but what shells they came from.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.170
Then you can get even crazier.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.330
You can scan very
slowly over one

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:50.670
of these peaks with
0.001 eV precision

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.680
and start to see
something pretty cool.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.008
If you look at the
carbon 1s electrons,

00:39:56.008 --> 00:39:58.050
you can see that there
are actually three of them

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.470
only a couple eV apart,
and this corresponds

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:06.220
to different binding states
of molecules with that carbon.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.410
For an even more subtle
example, but ended up

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.170
being incredibly
important for us,

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.750
here's one of the
chromium 2p shell peaks.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.340
You can actually
see there's three

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.400
of them superimposed
give that funny

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.148
looking peak shape right there.

00:40:20.148 --> 00:40:21.940
What that actually
tells us is that there's

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.290
chromium in three different
binding states in that oxide.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.080
And the ones we figured
out must be there,

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.840
we saw the ones corresponding
to Cr2O3, FeCr2O4,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.810
and I forget which other one,
but we have them tabulated.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.570
There we go.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.270
Oh wow.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:49.270
Fe 2.4 Cr 0.64, known
crystallographic phases

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.130
of these oxides.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.350
So you can look
at the peaks found

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.560
to have resolution of like
100th of an electron volt,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.560
compared to reference values
taken on pure compounds

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.850
and materials to figure out
what actual oxides do you have.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.415
That can help tell you things
like how protective are they,

00:41:06.415 --> 00:41:08.290
how fast are they going
to grow, and are they

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.820
going to be a
problem if you want

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.430
to use this new stainless
steel that we developed

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.763
in a lead bismuth reactor.

00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:16.680
The biggest problem with
lead bismuth reactors

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.675
is lead corrodes
like everything.

00:41:18.675 --> 00:41:20.550
And so the whole point
of my graduate studies

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.430
was design an alloy that
doesn't corrode and lead

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.780
and make ab alloy
composite out of it.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.500
But you can't prove that it
works unless you not only know

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.670
how fast it corrodes, but how
it corrodes, which oxides form,

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.852
and in what order.

00:41:34.852 --> 00:41:36.310
That's the last
part I haven't told

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.650
you about yet is what order.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:44.910
So I want to switch to another
technique called secondary ion

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.430
mass spectroscopy or SIMS.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.760
In this case, you start
off with firing ions

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.840
at a material, which will
then eject or sputter away

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.130
secondary ions.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.570
In this case, this
process of sputtering--

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.350
let's say this is
your material here.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.950
You send in something
like oxygen ions, which

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:12.370
might be like O2 minus
with a mass of 32,

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:17.300
and then you blast
off or sputter away.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.640
A few atoms at a time
from that surface,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.287
and they'll come off the
various masses and charges,

00:42:25.287 --> 00:42:26.870
and in this case,
the sputtering could

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.720
be due to Rutherford scattering,
because you might directly

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.510
ballistically slam and
ion out of the surface.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:36.080
Then every one of these
ions has a different mass

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.070
and a different charge.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.100
And by sending it through
a mass spectrometer,

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.680
something that separates
these materials by their mass

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.290
to charge ratio, because
the higher the charge,

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.330
the more deflected
an ion will be.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.588
But the higher the mass, the
less deflected it will be.

00:42:51.588 --> 00:42:53.005
That should sound
really familiar.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:00.710
In our idea here where how these
ionization collisions happen,

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.750
if you remember the
higher the charge,

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.270
the stronger the Coulomb force--

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:11.590
that q1, q2 over r squared.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.330
I think there was a
constant in there.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.210
So the higher the charge,
the higher those q's,

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.340
and the stronger
the Coulomb forces.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.480
But the larger the masses, the
less momentum it can impart.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.000
And so the deflection
will be weaker.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.340
Exact same thing's
happening here.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.890
And you can separate
out atoms not only

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.560
by their charge and their
mass, but specifically

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.078
by their isotope.

00:43:35.078 --> 00:43:36.620
So this is one of
those ways that you

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.640
can figure out and make an
isotopic map of a material

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.140
in three dimensions.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.900
You can scan your ion
beam across the material

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.180
and collect the
ions at every point.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.160
And as you sputter,
you slowly wear away

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.400
layers of this material.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.900
And so you can actually
reconstruct a 3D map

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.070
with almost nanometer precision
of every single isotope that

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.280
was at every location,
which is quite cool.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.560
As you can see, these
master charge ratios

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.830
can depend on which isotope
of silicon you have,

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.230
what sort of cluster, what
molecule, what charge you have.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.530
And you can do some pretty
crazy analysis of things

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.420
to even figure out
what sort of compounds

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.870
exist on surfaces, because
sometimes you sputter off

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:23.220
whole molecules.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.170
They're going to have their
own mass to charge ratio.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:31.260
And that's what we did for
this lead bismuth work.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.750
Lots of XPS spectra
to jump through.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.170
We wanted to find out
which oxides were forming

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.110
and in what order.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.820
Which one's the best
one I want to show?

00:44:44.277 --> 00:44:45.110
Think it's this one.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:52.330
So in this case, we
used ion sputtering

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.810
to sputter away surface layers
to a depth of a few hundred

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.800
nanometers, and we're actually
able to show that the chromium

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.640
oxide, right here, was on
the outside of the sample,

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.540
followed by silicon oxide,
followed by iron metal.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.330
So in this way, we
were able to figure out

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.280
using XPS, the
nature of the oxides

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.160
and using SIMS, the
order of the oxides,

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.100
so not only how fast were they
growing to nanometer precision,

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.920
but in what order did they form.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.610
And that helped us
figure out this sort

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:27.412
of synergistic chromium and
silicon oxidation mechanism

00:45:27.412 --> 00:45:29.870
that helps really protect the
layers of the stainless steel

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:34.350
and explain why it's corrosion
resistant lead bismuth,

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.970
all using principles from 22.01.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.607
So it's about two of five of.

00:45:41.607 --> 00:45:43.440
So I wanted to stop and
see if you guys have

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.500
any questions on these
analytical techniques,

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.250
knowing that we're
actually going to go do

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.690
a couple of these next Friday.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.508
Has anyone used any
of these before?

00:45:53.508 --> 00:45:54.800
Yeah, which ones have you used?

00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:01.260
AUDIENCE: SEM and
XPS, XPS [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.110
MICHAEL SHORT: SEM and XPS?

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.108
OK, cool.

00:46:04.108 --> 00:46:05.650
Yeah, we've got all
these instruments

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.630
I think except for
SIMS here at MIT.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.470
Yeah.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.970
Yeah.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.845
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what
is that second equation

00:46:14.845 --> 00:46:18.585
on the energy for
Compton scattering?

00:46:18.585 --> 00:46:21.210
MICHAEL SHORT: This would be the
energy of the Compton electron

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:25.440
that comes out when a
photon scatters off of it.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.020
So the photon will end
up losing some energy,

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.165
and the Compton electron
will pick up that energy.

00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:33.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.370
MICHAEL SHORT: Sorry?

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.530
AUDIENCE: What's the
denominator of that?

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.810
MICHAEL SHORT: It's a
1 plus alpha times 1

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.030
minus cosine theta,
where alpha--

00:46:42.745 --> 00:46:45.330
I'll mention what alpha is.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:50.230
It's a ratio of the photon
energy to the electron rest

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.070
mass energy.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.740
This is kind of a nice-- on
these two boards right here,

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.960
it's kind of a nice
summary of the stuff we've

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.912
been doing over the
last three weeks or so,

00:47:03.912 --> 00:47:05.620
and then all the stuff
I showed you today

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.890
is what you can do with it.

MATTHEW VANDER
HEIDEN: So today I

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.420
want to continue our discussion
of amino acid metabolism.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.340
And before we do
that, I just want

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.080
to come back for a few
minutes and revisit the urea

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.510
cycle and the Krebs
bicycle that we

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.340
discussed at the very
end of the last lecture.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.910
I only want to do
that because it--

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.260
a lot going on with this cycle.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.070
It can appear on the
surface to be confusing,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.050
the molecules are hard to draw.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.410
And so I just wanted
to draw it neatly here

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.660
for you one last time
and go through it again.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.790
And so remember, if we start
from the amino acid arginine,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.600
arginine can be converted into
the non-proteinogenic amino

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.160
acid ornithine, and in
the process, release urea.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.209
That ornithine can then be
in the mitochondria converted

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:09.520
to citrulline, another
non-proteinogenic amino acid.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.190
By picking up a
carbon and a nitrogen

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.030
from this molecule,
carbamoyl phosphate, which

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.840
is generated from
CO2/bicarbonate, as well

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.880
as ammonia and to
phosphorylations with ATP

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.530
to get carbamoyl
carbon phosphate,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.350
that's added to ornithine
to get citrulline.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.880
That citrulline and then combine
with the amino acid aspertate

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.730
to give this molecule,
argininosuccinate.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.910
So arginine plus
a succinate on it.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.640
And then loss of fumarate
leaves you with arginine.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.610
That fumarate a can, of course,
go through the TCA cycle

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.600
to regenerate malate,
oxaloacetate, ultimately pick

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.370
up nitrogen on oxaloacetate
is that alpha-keto acid,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.190
is transaminated to
aspertate, of course

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.830
getting that nitrogen
from glutamate

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.960
to alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.570
And glutamate, of course,
can get its nitrogen

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.300
either by transamination
with another amino acid

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.310
to an alpha-keto
acid, converting

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.020
alpha-ketoglutarate
to glutamate,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.070
or glutamate can be generated
by this redox reaction

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.760
where it picks up on ammonia
via the enzyme glutamate

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.740
dehydrogenase.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.750
So, you'll notice in this cycle
that ultimately the arginine,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.890
the urea group-- what is
released as urea from arginine,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.310
comes from the
carbamoyl phosphate.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.800
So that's one of
these nitrogens that

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.770
was picked up in the synthesis
of carbamoyl phosphate.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.380
And the other one
comes from aspertate,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.210
which, of course,
can come from ammonia

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.050
via glutamate dehydrogenase
and transamination,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.380
or from transamination
from nitrogen picked up

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.900
from any other amino acid to
ultimately end up on aspertate.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.300
You'll notice that
there's redox balance

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.860
across this whole cycle.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.430
And so there's a
NAD that's required

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.010
to reconvert the malate
to oxaloacetate to run

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.570
this half of the reaction.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.880
But of course, if we
pick up an ammonia,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.900
we also have a redox
reaction involved

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.930
in the glutamate
dehydrogenase reaction.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.650
You'll see that ATP is also--

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.370
quite a bit of ATP is needed.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.900
You need 2 ATP to generate
each carbamoyl phosphate,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.947
as well as 2 ATP equivalents
to generate argininosuccinate,

00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:38.530
because remember, if you go back
to your notes from last time,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.770
you'll see that ATP to
AMP plus pyrophosphate

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.700
was part of the citrulline
and aspertate generating

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.830
argininosuccinate reaction.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.110
And the last thing
is that CO2 is

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.640
required to run the urea cycle.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.930
That's where the carbon
in urea comes from.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.170
And that CO2 is, of
course, picked up

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.920
in the generation of
carbamoyl phosphate.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.920
Now, I think sometimes we can
fall into the misconception

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.680
when we talk about these
that all cells generate urea.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.040
That's not true.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.150
So remember, different organisms
use different strategies

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.779
to excrete nitrogen. So
in us as humans, the liver

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.320
and the kidney would run the
recycle as I have drawn it here

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.470
as a way to ultimately
produce urea that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.390
gets excreted in the blood--

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.900
I mean, sorry, in the
urine, whereas most tissues

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.930
in our body would
simply ship off

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.200
excess nitrogen from the
catabolism of amino acids

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.500
to the liver and the kidney
by generating either glutamate

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.990
or glutamine in the reactions
that we talked about last time,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.640
and then those organs would
deal with-- use the urea cycle

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.300
to produce urea and get
rid of excess nitrogen.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.950
But of course,
there's other animals

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.970
that will use other strategies
secreted as ammonia directly

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.000
or produce the purine uric
acid, which, of course,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.830
we'll talk about next time,
how one can interconnect

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.180
all this amino acid nitrogen
metabolism with nucleic acid

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.880
nitrogen metabolism.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.050
I just want to stress that
this glutamate dehydrogenase

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.340
reaction is a really
key reaction that

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.510
is necessary to get nitrogen
in and out of the system.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.130
And once you get nitrogen
in and out of the system,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.370
you can then use these
transamination reactions

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.760
to move nitrogens around
between amino acids

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.150
and alpha-keto acids using
pyridoxal phosphate as we

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.830
discussed last time.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.260
This is shown up above also
as the bicycle reaction.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.620
And again, just stresses
that you sort of

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.090
are running the urea cycle on
the right, this other TCA--

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.520
modified TCA cycle, if
you will, on the left,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.720
and ultimately illustrates how
you pick up those nitrogens

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.600
and CO2 to generate urea.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.820
But, of course, if
we're going to talk

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.850
about how you would make
amino acids, which is really

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.460
the topic of today,
how you break down

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.680
and synthesize the
carbon skeletons

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.830
of different amino acids,
well, obviously here's

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.000
arginine metabolism.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.560
You can imagine
that you could use

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.980
the same reactions to produce
or break down arginine,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.100
and that is what happens.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.640
But I also want to talk about
the remaining amino acids.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.770
In the remaining
amino acids, it's

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.350
really about how do we
deal with the carbon

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.600
skeleton, the alpha-keto acids.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.240
And of course,
these are linked via

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.190
this pyridoxal phosphate-driven
transamination reaction.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.270
Now, I don't have
time to in this course

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.590
to go through how each amino
acid carbon skeleton is

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.110
produced and broken down.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.410
We'll discuss some major themes.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.810
However, if I don't cover
your favorite amino acid,

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.940
because of course,
all people should

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.230
have a favorite amino acid,
you can look up the pathways

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.900
to make it or break
it down, and I

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.030
promise that if
you paid attention

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.420
through the whole class, you
have the skills to understand

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.080
that particular pathway even
if we don't study it in class.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.250
So I want to remind
you that in general

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.700
for amino acid catabolism--

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.637
and this is in general.

00:07:38.637 --> 00:07:39.970
Of course, there are exceptions.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.350
Arginine would behave as I just
described for the urea cycle.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:52.140
But for most amino acids, you
start with transamination.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.130
So what does that give you?

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.900
That gives the nitrogen
to alpha-ketoglutarate

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.510
to generate glutamate.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.780
And so that glutamate
can then be shipped off

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.730
to generate ammonia
if you're a fish,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.230
generate urea if you're
a human, et cetera.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.420
And what does that
leave you with?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:25.980
That leaves you with a
alpha-keto acid related

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:34.280
to the amino acid that can
then be oxidized to CO2 using

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.120
various pathways-- burn it and
get energy, just like we've

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.370
described for carbohydrates
and fatty acids, or, of course,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:50.560
in some cases produce glucose
or some other molecule that

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.710
can then be used to support
gluconeogenesis in the liver,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.110
keep glucose high in our blood.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:02.410
And so that's generally how
most amino acids are stabilized.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.210
It's very clear how this works.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.910
If we start with some of
the more obvious ones--

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.200
so we talked last time about
how alanine, the amino acid,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.530
is related--

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.100
so transamination, get
the alpha-keto acid.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.870
That alpha-keto acid
is pyruvate, aspertate.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.905
Amino acid undergoes
transamination.

00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:25.660
The alpha-keto acid
is oxaloacetate.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.060
Glutamate undergoes
transamination.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.410
alpha-keto acid is
alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.430
It's very clear how
all of these can end up

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:45.630
in the TCA cycle or
gluconeogenesis for The cell

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:51.540
to either oxidize for energy
or to produce something

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.733
like glucose that can
be used elsewhere.

00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:56.400
Now of course, there's
other amino acids

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.150
out there that we've
already talked about.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.230
So remember asparagine,
very similar to aspertate.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.490
Glutamine similar to glutamate.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.980
So those were the ammonia
group on the side chain.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.280
We can simply remove those.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.870
Should be clear how to
then get those into the TCA

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.870
cycle or gluconeogenesis.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.040
A little bit of
metabolic trivia.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.930
Humans, we actually
don't have an enzyme

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.310
to break down asparagine.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.170
Other organisms do.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.350
And then the other one that
we alluded to last time

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:37.090
was proline, which is cyclized
and oxidized glutamate.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.040
And so I'll just
illustrate here quickly how

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.500
proline can be metabolized
just so you can see this.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.770
So here's the
amino acid proline.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.730
And so proline,
to show you, if we

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:09.070
do oxidation of this
carbon-nitrogen bond,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.200
so that utilizes these
an electron acceptor.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.870
That electron
acceptor happens to be

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.740
FAD being reduced to FADH2.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:30.920
That generates this molecule.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.850
We can then add water
across that double bond.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.180
Now we can open up
the ring like this.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.320
So just opened up the ring.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.350
Now I'm going to oxidize
this aldehyde to the acid.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.470
So if I do that, something
else has to be reduced.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:38.330
That something else can
be NAD+ or NADP+ depending

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.860
on the enzyme.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.700
There's enzymes that use
either NAD or NADP to make

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.390
NADPH or NADH respectively.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:13:11.890
And then what I'm left with
is this amino acid glutamate.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.010
And so that's how I turn
proline into glutamate.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.510
Two additional oxidation
steps generating

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.600
FADH2 and NAD or NADPH.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.410
And so that's how you
would derive energy

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:32.013
from the catabolism of proline,
by feeding it into glutamate,

00:13:32.013 --> 00:13:33.805
which can then, of
course, be transaminated

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.980
to alpha-ketoglutarate,
and the rest of the carbon

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.900
enter the TCA cycle.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.560
OK.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.620
So that covers 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 amino acids.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.780
7 if you count arginine
that we talked about

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.390
with the urea cycle.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.020
That leaves 13
additional amino acids.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.860
Many of them are first
transaminated to the alpha-keto

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.400
acid, and then ultimately use--

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.460
the carbon skeleton
can be used to generate

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.700
another intermediate
that's either involved

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.880
in the TCA cycle or glycolysis.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.040
And shown here on the
slide is basically

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.110
just a figure from
a textbook that

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.950
contains all of the various--

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.390
all of the 20 amino
acids from protein

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.800
and what they generate either
in the TCA cycle or up here.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.530
So you can see here [INAUDIBLE]
oxaloacetate, fumarate

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.930
succinyl-CoA,
alpha-ketoglutarate, acetyl-CoA

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.300
pyruvate, acetyl acetate.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.340
Which, of course,
as we saw last time,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.610
can be used to
generate 2 acetyl-CoA

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.840
or be used to generate the
ketone body beta-hydroxy

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.300
butyrate.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.770
Now, obviously if you can
generate any of these things,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.610
we already know the pathways
about how you can oxidize them,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.600
or, in some cases, how you
can turn them into glucose.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.030
But now I want to
return to this idea

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.290
that we've come to a
bunch of different times

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.830
that really comes down to this
fact of what we talked about

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:14.560
with the TCA cycle, how the TCA
cycle can't net do anaplerosis

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.450
from two carbon units.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:22.210
That is, you can't turn
acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.820
because that's just two
acetylcholine molecules,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.000
into anything that
can generate glucose.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.130
that We don't have
the glyoxylate cycle.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.980
Organisms that have the
glyoxylate cycle can do this,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.530
but we as humans cannot do that.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.100
Now, many of our
amino acids can be

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.405
used to produce things like
fumarate, succinyl-CoA,

00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:44.770
oxaloacetate.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.550
All of that stuff can easily
be turned into glucose.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:55.660
And so if we starve ourselves or
go on a low-carbohydrate diet,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.590
well, what happens is, our liver
will break down amino acids

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.920
and use those amino
acids to make glucose,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.620
but we can only make
glucose from amino acids

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.380
if those amino acids
are broken down

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.280
into something that's not
acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.640
because we don't have
a glyoxylate cycle.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.460
Just remember I mentioned
a couple lectures

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.920
ago when we talked about
the ketogenic diet,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.030
a true ketogenic diet isn't
just low carbohydrates,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.600
it's also low protein
because your liver will turn

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.360
that protein back into glucose.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.520
And so if you really
want to be ketotic,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.080
you have to limit
both glucose and--

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.190
both sugars and proteins,
because fat, of course,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.977
will only be broken
into two carbon units,

00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:45.560
and you can't turn
those into glucose,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.270
so you instead turn
them into ketones.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.620
Now, not all amino
acid skeletons,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.600
though, can be used
to make something

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.700
that can generate glucose.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.270
Some can only make stuff--

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.620
acetyl-CoA,
acetoacetate-- that can

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.680
be used to generate ketones.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.690
And so this defines another
way to classify amino acids,

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:23.444
is so-called glucogenic amino
acids or ketogenic amino acids.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.410
And this is a direct consequence
of what those amino acid carbon

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.540
skeletons are broken into.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.830
And so a glucogenic
amino acid is really

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:51.590
any amino acid where
the product of breakdown

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:57.250
is greater than 2 carbons
that is not acetyl-CoA.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:07.950
Whereas ketogenic amino
acid is an amino acid

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:23.010
where the product of
breakdown is acetyl-CoA.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:33.290
And I should mention,
or acetoacetate,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:37.890
because acetoacetate, as
we saw, is 2 acetyl-CoAs.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.720
So acetyl-CoA, acetoacetate can
be turned into the ketone body

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.358
beta-hydroxybutyrate, an
alternative fuel for the brain.

00:18:51.358 --> 00:18:53.150
If you break down an
amino acid and all you

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.520
get is acetyl-CoA
or acetoacetate,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:02.270
you can't turn that carbon
skeleton back into glucose;

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.090
therefore, it's a
ketogenic amino acid.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.690
All other amino acids that
generate oxaloacetate,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.990
succinyl-CoA, whatever,
something greater

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.490
than 2 carbons, not
acetyl-CoA, it can then

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.410
be turned into glucose,
therefore, it's

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.590
a glucogenic amino acids.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.700
Now if we come back
over here to our slide

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.490
and you look at the
various amino acids,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.600
most of the amino acids are
turned into something that

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.070
can be turned into glucose.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:39.710
And so most amino acids
are so-called glucogenic.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:45.860
However, there's a few amino
acids that are ketogenic,

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.080
and there's some
amino acids that are

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.540
both glucogenic and ketogenic.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.330
And so if you look here
through the slide, what you'll

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.360
find is that tyrosine and
isoleucine-- so there's

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.850
isoleucine, here's tyrosine.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.560
So they're turned into
ketones, but they can also be--

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.690
here's tyrosine,
here's isoleucine--

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.375
can also be turned
into something

00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:08.750
that can be used
to make glucose,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:14.060
and so they're referred to as
both glucogenic and ketogenic.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.060
Now, as I said before,
we don't have time

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.470
to go through how to break
down all of the amino acids,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.190
but I will take you through
how you break down the three

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.170
branched chain amino acids.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.912
And I will do that
because, first of all,

00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:31.370
it will illustrate
that you already

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.380
know a lot about metabolism.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.720
You'll see that how
these are broken down

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.050
is just variations on pathways
that we've already discussed.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.960
And so it really
drives home the fact

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.120
that the complexity
of metabolism

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.470
is really just nature
repurposing relatively

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.110
few reactions over and
over and over again

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.740
in a way that ultimately builds
complexity and diversity,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.890
but in the end,
is actually quite

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.820
consistent across
the whole thing.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.840
And you'll also see examples
of how amino acid skeleton

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.760
breakdown can end up either
as glucogenic or ketogenic,

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.600
and that's because of the
various branched chain

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.580
amino acids.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:21.530
So there's, of course, leucine,
valine, and isoleucine.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.760
So those are the three
branched chain amino acids.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.730
You'll see the
leucine is ketogenic,

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:40.840
valine is glucogenic, and
isoleucine, as I just said,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.680
is both ketogenic
and glucogenic.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.190
So three very amino acids.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.260
In genetic terms,
very conservative

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.850
substitutions within a protein.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.950
Very related structures.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.880
However, the way they're broken
down, in the case of leucine,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.460
generates only things
that are ketogenic;

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.590
valine generates things
that are glucogenic;

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.630
and isoleucine generates both.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:20.170
And so we'll go through each of
these and see how that happens.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.520
So let's start with leucine.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.186
So leucine is a--

00:22:28.186 --> 00:22:33.990
I said above is a
ketogenic amino acid.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.820
And so leucine, like
many amino acids,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.760
starts break down
by transamination.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.470
So this transamination will,
of course, take the nitrogen

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.970
from leucine, an alpha-keto
acid, alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:56.610
generate glutamate, as well as
the alpha-keto acid of leucine,

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.190
which, just to remind
you leucine looks like,

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.165
looks like this.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.680
So this is the side chain
over here of leucine.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.410
Here's the alpha-keto
acid related to leucine.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.540
If I take this
alpha-keto group, turn it

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.640
into an amino group,
that's leucine.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.800
So this is the alpha-keto
acid related to leucine.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.700
So the next step of
leucine breakdown

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.930
involves oxidative
decarboxylation

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.060
of this alpha-keto acid.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.140
So if you remember, we've
seen this reaction before.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.220
We did it in pyruvate to
generate acetaldehyde,

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.260
an ethanol metabolism.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.850
We did it in--

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.950
well, we did alpha
decarboxylation there,

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.710
and then we did oxidative
alpha decarboxylation

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.440
when we turn pyruvate
into acetyl-CoA.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.690
And we turned
alpha-ketoglutarate

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.400
into succinyl-CoA.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.190
Well, that exact
reaction, which we

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.140
saw with pyruvate
decarboxylation,

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.330
as well as what we saw
with alpha-ketoglutarate

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.470
dehydrogenase generating
acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:18.540
is what happens here for the
alpha-keto acids produced

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.470
from breakdown of leucine
and other branched chain

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.880
amino acids.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.790
And so if you look
back in your notes,

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.510
we went through the
mechanism of this in detail.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:37.450
Remember, this involved
edition of CoA, loss of CO2,

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.020
it's an oxidation reaction.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.700
So remember, the electrons
needed to go somewhere,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.560
and so they ended
up going to NADH.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.510
So that's oxidized.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.150
NAD+ is reduced to NADH.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.740
And remember, this involved that
mini-electron transport chain

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:04.870
with FAD, lipoic acid, and TPP+.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.980
And in the end, that
releases the CO2

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:21.860
and you end up with this
branched chain acyl-CoA.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.360
So same reaction is PDH,
alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.890
dehydrogenase.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.750
Just like those two
reactions, remember,

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.150
that had an E1, an
E2, and an E3 subunit.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.050
So this actually uses
the exact same E2 and E3

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.000
subunit as those reactions.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.040
The E1 subunit is,
of course, different

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.200
because it's unique to the
branched chain amino acids,

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.860
whereas in pyruvate
dehydrogenase,

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.860
to be unique to pyruvate
and alpha-ketoglutarate

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.830
dehydrogenase, you need
the alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:59.860
In this case, this enzyme is
called BCKDH for Branched Chain

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.900
Keto Acid Dehydrogenase,
and allows

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.880
the oxidative decarboxylation
to generate this branched chain

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.640
acyl-CoA.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.890
Now this branched chain acyl-CoA
looks a lot like a fatty acid,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.770
and in fact, it's
metabolized very much like we

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.260
would do fatty acid oxidation.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.550
So what's the first step in
beta oxidation of fatty acids?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.910
Well, we would introduce
a double bond here.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.770
And so that's exactly
what happens next.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:40.700
So this would be a
membrane-bound FAD

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.850
containing enzyme, part of
the electron transport chain.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.883
Going to oxidize that
carbon-carbon bond.

00:26:47.883 --> 00:26:48.800
There's that generate.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.730
All right.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.182
Now, if we are doing
fatty acid oxidation,

00:27:03.182 --> 00:27:05.140
we would, of course, add
water across the bond.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.210
We'll do that in a minute.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.190
Before that happens,
the next step, though,

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.750
is that to facilitate
ultimately break down of this,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.360
we're going to end up
adding our carboxyl group

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.080
to the end of the molecule.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.260
So if we're going to add CO2
to the end of the molecule,

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.710
how would we do that?

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.540
Well, we've seen that reaction
many times before as well.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.760
So if we're going
to add a CO2 group,

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.010
that's going to
come from biotin.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:39.890
So the next enzyme would have
biotin in the active site that

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.210
can pick up a CO2.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.080
How does it pick up the CO2?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:53.820
Well, it picks up the CO2
via bicarbonate plus ATP,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.910
and that's going to go to--

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.670
that's going to phosphorylate
the bicarbonate.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.840
And then when we transfer that
phosphorylated bicarbonate

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.250
onto biotin, we'll release the
PI, then the CO2 from biotin

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.270
can be added to carboxylate.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.580
That molecule, just
like we've saw before

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.580
with other
carboxylation reactions,

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:25.820
and that will generate
this intermediate.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.900
This intermediate here.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.410
OK.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.620
So no new chemistry.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.640
You've seen all this
many times before.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.290
Now we're going
to continue with--

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.920
what we would do is if we
were breaking this down--

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.300
oxidizing it as a fatty acid.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.150
And so now we're going to add
water across that double bond.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.050
OK.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.490
Now we added water
across that double bond.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:36.220
And then now we're just going
to do this reaction, which

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:48.300
will generate from this side
of the molecule an acetyl-CoA.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.980
And if you look on the other
side of the molecule, what we

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:09.490
are left with is acetoacetate.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:34.130
Acetoacetate can be broken
down into two acetyl-CoAs.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.150
If I break it in half, add
CoA to each one of them

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.840
by reactions I showed you
before as well, or, of course,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.520
we can reduce this
ketone to the alcohol

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:52.610
and make the ketone body
beta-hydroxy butyrate.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.260
You can look that up from
the end of the last lecture.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.040
But in the end, this is
how one can break down

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.930
the leucine skeleton.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.450
You get a acetyl-CoA
or acetoacetate.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.690
Can't generate glucose from any
of those molecules as humans

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.520
because we don't have
a glyoxylate cycle.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.990
Therefore, leucine is
a ketogenic amino acid.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.590
All right.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.550
Valine.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.510
Let's look at valine.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:29.040
So valine is glucogenic
despite the fact

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.770
that it's very
similar to leucine

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.310
and broken down in a way
that's very similar to leucine.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.030
So, how do we break it down?

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:41.190
So first step, transamination.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.620
Nitrogen from valine
to alpha-ketoglutarate

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.180
to generate glutamate, and
as well as the branched

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:52.845
chain alpha-keto acid
that's related to valine.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.900
So that's the alpha-keto
acid related to valine.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.260
One carbon shorter
than side chain, one

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.050
carbon shorter than leucine.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:19.940
Just like we did
with leucine, we're

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.780
going to metabolize
the alpha-keto acid

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.870
with the branched chain
keto acid dehydrogenase.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.730
Same reaction.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.640
Oxidative decarboxylation here.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.280
That releases CO2, adds CoA.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.740
Reaction involves
also NAD+ to NADH.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.230
Requires lipoic acid, TPP+, FAD,
just like we described before.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.990
I'm not going to draw out
all the pieces of it again,

00:32:51.990 --> 00:33:06.830
but we're going to end up with
the branched chain acyl-CoA.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.500
Metabolize this
branched chain acyl-CoA

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.490
as if it's a fatty acid.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.700
And so first step, oxidize
this carbon-carbon bond.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.700
That electrons go
to FAD, make FADH2.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:41.335
This product, add water
across that double bond.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.940
Water across that double bond.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:10.300
Next, if we oxidize
this alcohol twice--

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.239
so oxidize it once,
we'll get the aldehyde.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.659
Oxidize it again, we can
get the carboxylic acid.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:31.989
And so oxidizing twice means
NAD+ times 2 and NADH times 2.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.795
And now that becomes the acid.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.639
OK.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:58.480
So same molecule, but now
this alcohol becomes an acid.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.900
I drew it that way on purpose.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.570
If you look back
in your notes, this

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:13.930
is methyl
methylmalonyl-CoA, which

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:21.220
we saw before in our discussion
of odd chain fatty acid

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.560
metabolism.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:30.950
And you'll remember that there
was this B12-dependent reaction

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:37.220
where I can basically swap
the positions of this proton

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.880
and this thioester group here.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.250
This is not aero-pushing.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:48.890
This B12-dependent
reaction that I described

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:55.460
before where I can
rearrange methylmalonyl-CoA

00:35:55.460 --> 00:36:13.897
to make this molecule,
which is succinyl-CoA.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.320
Succinyl-CoA oxidized in
the TCA cycle, generate ATP,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.770
but also can use it as
a substrate anaplerosis

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.810
for the TCA cycle, so it can
be used to generate glucose.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:33.020
And so that's why valine
is a glucogenic amino acid.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.550
All right.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:41.930
Last branched chain
amino acid is isoleucine.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:48.684
So isoleucine is both
ketogenic and glucogenic.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.960
So let's see how that happens.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.260
So if we start with
isoleucine, first we

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.420
undergo transformation.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.550
alpha-ketoglutarate
to glutamate,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:19.670
and you get the branched
chain alpha-keto acid.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:24.620
So that's isoleucine as an
alpha-keto acid rather than

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.480
an amino acid.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:31.530
Next step, do the
alpha decarboxylation

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:36.610
with branched keto
acid dehydrogenase.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:42.760
That removes that CO2, oxidizes
that carbon to the acid,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:57.680
and we end up with this
branched chain acyl-CoA.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.140
Same first steps
as we saw before.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.425
Metabolize that as
if it's a fatty acid.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.400
So oxidize that
carbon-carbon bond.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:25.325
Add water across
the double bond.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.070
OK.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.500
Get this intermediate.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:54.690
Now oxidize this
alcohol to the ketone.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:39:00.660
Electrons go to an NAD+,
which is reduced to NADH.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:36.450
Now we can use CoA to take off
this end of the molecule here,

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:47.140
which is acetyl-CoA,
hence ketogenic.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:40:04.330
The remainder of the molecule
is this three-carbon acyl-CoA.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.040
We saw this from odd chain
fatty acid metabolism.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.370
This is propionyl-CoA.

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:19.420
Remember, to deal with
that, we can add CO2.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:26.645
So that, of course,
requires biotin, and ATP.

00:40:26.645 --> 00:40:30.460
So remember, we had
CO2 to this molecule.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.100
That gives us methyl--

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.600
not going to draw it all
out for the sake of time,

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.520
but that gives us
methylmalonyl-CoA.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.370
Methylmalonyl-CoA
shown up there,

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.910
so it's adding CO2
to this molecule.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:53.460
And then we can do the
vitamin B12 rearrangement

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.900
to get succinyl-CoA.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.570
And so that can be
turned into glucose.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.720
And so it generates an
acetyl-CoA and a succinyl-CoA,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.830
isoleucine is both
glucogenic and ketogenic.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:15.390
And so a little tedious to go
through how you break down all

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.640
three of those branched
chain amino acids,

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.830
but it really illustrates
that it's just

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.560
variations on the same
chemistry that we've

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.610
seen before with fatty
acid metabolism, TCA cycle

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:31.230
reactions, that ultimately
generate intermediates that

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.880
can be fed into the TCA cycle,
oxidized further to CO2,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:41.040
generate ATP, generate NADH,
electron transport chain,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.880
oxidative phosphorylation,
supply the cell with energy

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.740
to do various kinds of work.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:50.730
Or can be turned into a
ketone if you're a human

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.000
and you start with acetyl--

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.720
and what you get is
acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.790
Or even into
glucose if you start

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.120
with something like
succinyl-CoA that

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.060
can be turned back into
glucose by the liver,

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.130
defining the difference
between the glucogenic

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.450
and the ketogenic amino acids.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.740
All right.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:15.290
Now going through branched
chain amino acid metabolism

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:19.940
also allows transition
into a discussion

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:32.620
of another topic which
are the so-called inborn

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.430
errors of metabolism.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.860
So what's an inborn
error of metabolism?

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:48.450
Well, sometimes
individuals are born

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.750
that have deficiencies
in enzymes

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:56.560
that are necessary to carry out
some function of metabolism.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.500
Some aspect of the biochemistry
we've been learning about.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.490
Now you can imagine that some
of these genetic deficiencies,

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:09.570
if it's somewhere smack in
the middle of central carbon

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.580
metabolism and you
can't generate energy,

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.950
it's not going to be
compatible with life.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:15.540
But it turns out
that some of them

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.740
are quite compatible with
life, like deficiency

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.250
in branched chain keto
acid dehydrogenase.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:34.950
So BCKDH deficiency is something
that children are sometimes

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:40.470
born with, and this deficiency
results in a disorder

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:44.310
called maple syrup
urine disease.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.100
So it's called maple
syrup urine disease

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.940
because the unit smells
like maple syrup,

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.870
but effectively what this is
is this is a disorder where

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.210
there's a deficiency in
the activity of branched

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.490
chain keto acid dehydrogenase.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:06.120
That means the cells
can't break down

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.980
branched chain amino acids.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:13.320
They end up generating some
otherwise side toxic product.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.860
Some of it ends up in the
urine, smells like maple syrup.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.850
But it also can result
in damage to the CNS

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:28.990
and problems with thinking,
mental retardation, et cetera.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:32.880
And so it can be quite
devastating to have

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.090
loss of this enzyme, which
prevents you from breaking down

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:40.050
branched chain amino acids,
a so-called inborn error

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.220
of metabolism.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.210
Now this is a
relatively rare disease.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.590
All of these are.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:49.590
But if you go to
medical school, these

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.960
are questions because
they lend themselves

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:57.690
to questions that often show
up on various board-type exams.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.750
And so it's good to
know that deficiencies

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:05.830
of some of these enzymes
can result in diseases.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.240
So maple syrup urine disease
caused by an inability

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.760
to break down branched chain
amino acids because you're

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.850
deficient in the enzyme
branched chain amino acid--

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.730
or branched keto
acid dehydrogenase,

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.950
which catalyzes the stuff
I showed you up there

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:24.750
in the breakdown of all three
branched chain amino acids.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.610
By no means is
this the only one.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.560
Often these are associated
with amino acid breakdown.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.180
And so two of the
other more common--

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.070
all of these are very rare,
but relatively more common ones

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.320
is a disease called
alkaptonuria.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.950
So what's alkaptonuria?

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.630
Well, that's missing an enzyme--

00:45:52.430 --> 00:46:01.150
so enzyme deficiency in
tryptophan metabolism.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:14.780
And another one is
fennel phenylketonuria,

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:25.570
which is an enzyme deficiency
in phenylalanine metabolism.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.810
Branched chain amino acids are
very common, but tryptophan,

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.820
phenylalanine, two of the
more rare amino acids,

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.350
it turns out these are two
of the amino acid breakdown

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:45.030
deficiencies that have
less severe phenotypes,

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:49.080
and so they're somewhat--

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.250
more people walking around
with those conditions.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.890
If any of you have had
children or someday

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.500
when you have children,
what will happen

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.350
is that you will notice
that when babies are born,

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.810
one of the first things
that's done with infants

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:07.000
is they have a
blood test sent out.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.640
They do a little heel
stick, collect some blood,

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.620
and send it to the
state lab where

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.130
they test for various
inborn errors of metabolism.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:19.120
What they're looking for is
things like phenylketonuria,

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.677
maple syrup urine
disease, et cetera.

00:47:21.677 --> 00:47:23.260
Why do they want to
find these things?

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:27.820
Well, it's because if you
have too much of the product,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.760
too much phenylalanine, too much
tryptophan, too much branched

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.250
chain amino acid, and you
can't break them down,

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.920
it's not the lack of the
ability to break them down

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.030
that's necessarily the problem.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.540
The problem is is that the
inability to break them down

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.910
leads to overwhelming
a system building up

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.790
of toxic intermediates
that damage the brain.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.910
And so by doing these
newborn screening panels,

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.460
it's greatly enhanced the
management of these things,

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.310
because often you can
control the symptoms

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.810
by dietary intervention.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.300
Simply limiting
the phenylalanine

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.900
or the branched chain amino
acid or the tryptophan intake

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.510
in the diet is a treatment
for these diseases,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.980
and so therefore, if you
know about them early,

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.200
limiting exposure
to those things

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.210
limits the exposure to the
toxic breakdown products that

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.560
can't be metabolized because of
the deficiency, and therefore,

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.730
limits the effects on the brain.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:29.440
If you drink diet soda and you
look at the side of your diet

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.270
soda can, what's written on the
side of it is phenylketonurics,

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.310
contains phenylalanine.

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:37.660
Why is that written there?

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.840
Well, because if you happen
to be a phenylketonuric,

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.410
you shouldn't drink diet soda.

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:44.950
Why?

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.290
Because the artificial
sweetener in there contains

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.630
phenylalanine, and so
this would give you

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.300
a big dose of phenylalanine,
and if you can't break down

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.990
phenylalanine, that's a problem.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:57.460
So it's a warning to the
people in the population who

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.420
happen to have phenylketonuria
not to drink diet soda.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.650
All right.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.350
Now, I want to say
a few other things

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:15.740
about amino acid metabolism,
only because these things will

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:21.380
come up for you as you
go through other aspects

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.415
of biology.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:34.720
And that is that amino acids are
very versatile starting points

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.440
to build all kinds of
hormones and neurotransmitters

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.540
and bioactive molecules.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.610
So I know some people--

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.950
some of the MIT students
in the class are course 9.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:51.880
That's the brain and
cognitive science.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.530
Classes you take,
you'll learn a lot

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.030
about different
neurotransmitters.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.820
Well, one of the canonical
neurotransmitters

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.260
is an amino acid itself.

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.020
It's the amino acid glutamate.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.782
So obviously that's important
for the brain to work.

00:50:04.782 --> 00:50:06.490
But what are the other
neurotransmitters?

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:10.860
Well, there's things
like dopamine,

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:17.125
epinephrine, norepinephrine.

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:25.800
These are all
bioactive molecules,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.510
have to come from somewhere.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.570
Well, it turns out all
of these ultimately come

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:35.610
from the metabolism of tyrosine,
which, of course, can also

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:39.120
come from the metabolism
of phenylalanine.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.250
And so don't have
time to go into it,

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.620
but you can look up the
pathways to generate

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.560
these various
neurotransmitters from tyrosine

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.370
if you're interested.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.500
What's the other big
neurotransmitter?

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.390
Well, it's acetylcholine.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.850
What's acetylcholine?

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.240
Well, let's break it down.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:07.490
Well, it's an acetyl group,
so that comes from acetyl-CoA.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:11.030
And choline-- and
what's choline?

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:16.310
Well, choline comes from,
ultimately as I showed you--

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:21.770
alluded to before,
ethanolamine, and ethanolamine

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.050
comes from serine.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.910
We'll come back to this later.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:29.195
And so serine metabolism,
as well acetyl-CoA,

00:51:29.195 --> 00:51:31.820
is how you get acetylcholine.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.290
It's also choline the
phospholipids and ethanolamine

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.250
for the phospholipids.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:42.400
If you're not into the
brain but into other aspects

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.270
pathophysiology--
so thyroid hormone,

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.280
very common thing
that many people

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.400
need replacement of, very
important to manage physiology

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.360
in our body.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:59.360
Thyroid hormone also
comes from thyroxine.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:09.230
Melanin, the pigment that makes
our skin different shades,

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:15.070
melanin, the skin
pigment, it is basically

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:17.950
produced from dopamine--

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:20.920
or actually, a
dopamine metabolite.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.430
So dopamine precursor.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:29.210
Which comes from
tyrosine as well.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:31.480
And so if you're
interested in any

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.190
of these particular
molecules, of course,

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.190
you can look up in the book and
you'll see how they're made,

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.740
and I promise, you have the
ability to understand it,

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.820
it's repurposing some reactions
that we've already seen.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.650
There's some unique
ones in there

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:46.810
like melanin synthesis
is actually parts

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.150
of it are non-enzymatic, even.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:53.780
But this-- I like to mention
this because obviously we

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.300
don't have time to
study and discuss

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.390
the entire complexity
of the metabolic map,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:03.770
but really, you understand
the basics, the central parts

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:07.280
of it, and it's the same
reactions repurposed out

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.410
in different
directions that allows

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:11.930
this complexity and this
diversity of metabolism,

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.140
making all of these
different biomolecules that

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.020
are necessary for the cells
to do things, and, of course,

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.500
you can go look these up
if you're interested in any

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.510
of them specifically.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.000
And regardless, you should
have some appreciation

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.520
of how these things
all interconnect

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.500
with the other pathways
that we've talked about.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.100
All right.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.890
All right.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:44.690
So now I want to turn
to amino acid synthesis

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:50.060
and say a few words about
how amino acids are built.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.450
So of course, we've covered
some of these already,

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.500
and as a very general
statement, many of them

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.300
are made by transamination.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.330
So first you build
the alpha-keto acid,

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:07.490
and then you transaminate that
alpha-keto acid from glutamate

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:11.280
to generate the amino acid.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.220
Now of course, the pathways
that you use to make amino acids

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.990
are not the same as
the pathways that you

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.700
use to break down amino acids.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.850
So again, if you paid attention
for the entire course,

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:28.280
it should be clear for both
thermodynamic energetic reasons

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.310
that you can't have the same
pathways to build and break

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:36.500
stuff down because all pathways
delta G has to be less than 0.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.990
So we saw this with
glucose and fatty acids.

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:41.760
We can repurpose-- some
steps can be the same,

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.070
but the ones that allow
the energetic driving have

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:49.790
to be different because you
have to couple one direction

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.490
to energy consumption
and the other one

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.733
could be spontaneous
if it releases energy,

00:54:54.733 --> 00:54:56.150
and you have to
have pathways that

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:59.310
can work in either direction.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:03.950
But, in general, if you can
build an alpha-keto acid

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:08.180
like oxaloacetic acid
or alpha-ketoglutarate

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.990
or pyruvate, well,
obviously we can

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:16.082
transaminate all of these
things to get the amino acid.

00:55:16.082 --> 00:55:17.540
So alpha-ketoglutarate
to glutamate

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.670
can also be from
glutamate dehydrogenase.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:22.010
That's how you can get new
nitrogen into the system.

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:23.720
And that way we can
generate aspartame

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:29.870
glutamate and alanine, and
aspertate into asparagine,

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:33.470
asparagine by adding
the ammonia to it.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:35.210
That would be a very
similar reaction

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:37.550
to glutamate into glutamine.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:40.550
That's glutamate synthase,
asparagine synthase.

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:43.520
Same mechanism describe
glutamate synthase last time

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.930
to make glutamine.

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:48.560
And of course, proline,
as I showed you earlier,

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.870
is cyclized, and in
this case, oxidized--

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:58.220
or sorry, cyclized
then reduced glutamate.

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:02.920
And then-- so that's
six of the amino acids.

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:07.150
We covered arginine
earlier, that seven.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:11.680
And so 13 other amino acids.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.350
Here's another figure
from a book just showing

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:20.590
the starting material to make
all of the various amino acids.

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:23.120
Obviously we know how
to make oxaloacetate,

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.530
phosphoenolpyruvate, erythrose
4-phosphate, pyruvate,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.750
ribose 5-phosphate,
3-phosphoglycerate,

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.280
and alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.190
And so generation of
those by the pathways

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:36.340
we've already talked about
then allows those molecules

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.830
to be shunted into
pathways to generate

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:42.590
all of the various amino acids.

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.580
Now I want to
reiterate, humans, we

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.100
can't make all 20 amino acids.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.090
Animals can't do that.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.160
Many organisms, of course, can.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.030
We lost the ability to make
nine of our amino acids,

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:58.720
and in fact, if you count the
two conditional ones, really

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.110
11 of amino acids, even though
we can turn phenylalanine

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:05.320
into tyrosine, we still need
a source of phenylalanine

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.530
to do so.

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:10.510
And so each of these nine or 11,
depending on how you count it,

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:14.628
essential amino acids
must be eaten in the diet.

00:57:14.628 --> 00:57:16.420
So there are obviously
pathways to do them,

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:20.890
we just don't have the
enzymes in humans to do it.

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:24.370
And then the other
ones we do retain.

00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:26.620
You can obviously
look up the pathway

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.960
that's used by whatever
organism to make

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.690
your favorite amino acid.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:36.655
Today what I want to discuss
is how we will make--

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:46.100
today I want to discuss how we
will make serine and glycine,

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.730
because it turns out,
serine and s metabolism

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:53.490
play a key role
in other pathways,

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:55.700
including nucleotide
synthesis which we

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.630
will cover in the next lecture.

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:02.150
Serine glycine
metabolism also is a way

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:06.920
to make one carbon units that
are more reduced than CO2.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.180
And these will be critical for
one-carbon transfer reactions

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:17.230
that you'll encounter throughout
other aspects of biology.

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:23.860
So, serine and glycine,
very important amino acids.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.010
And so just to be
clear about this,

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.420
so it turns out
serine-glycine metabolism,

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.470
important for nucleotides
among carbon units,

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:33.770
we'll see that a lot.

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:38.270
But serine and glycine also
used to make phospholipid head

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.770
groups.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.530
Nucleotides, one-carbon units
we're going to talk about.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.240
I want you to
appreciate, you also

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.580
need serine to make
phospholipid head groups.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.750
So what do I mean by that?

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:06.960
Well, of course, there's
phosphatidylserine.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:15.840
Obviously that's serine is the
head group, and so serine--

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.970
the amino acid is
required for that.

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:22.220
But also used to
generate ethanolamine.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.740
So what is ethanolamine?

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:40.420
Well again, just to
remind you of this,

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:44.620
so here is the
amino acid serine.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.160
So, to generate
ethanolamine, it's

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.260
decarbonization of
serine to do that.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:56.810
So loss of this CO2.

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.810
This is a reaction I don't
have time to go into,

00:59:58.810 --> 00:59:59.602
you can look it up.

00:59:59.602 --> 01:00:03.310
It is another repurposing
of pyridoxal phosphate.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:09.110
And that generates
this molecule,

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.670
which is ethanolamine.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:17.760
That ends up head group on
phosphatidylethanolamine.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.030
And if I want to
turn it into choline,

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:24.540
either for acetylcholine
as a neurotransmitter

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:27.540
or for phosphatidylcholine
as a head group,

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:35.310
it's basically adding
3 methyl groups

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:39.810
onto this nitrogen
of ethanolamine.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:46.680
And so those three
methyl groups,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.910
that's a carbon that's
more reduced than CO2.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.890
That's a so-called
one carbon unit.

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:58.320
It turns out, as you'll see,
those also come from serine.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.140
Last thing is serine
is necessary to make

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.500
head groups for a class of
lipids called sphingolipids.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:13.680
There's a-- sphingosine is
another amino alcohol that

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.890
is generated from serine
and ends up being the head

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.930
group for sphingolipids.

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:22.080
Especially if you're
interested in the immune system

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.880
of the brain, these end up
being important molecules.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.730
And so you can
look up how they're

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.820
related to serine, but just
appreciate that for now

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.630
that they--

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:33.840
another important
downstream thing that's

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.780
generated from
serine metabolism.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.290
Also illustrating
how amino acids

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.790
can be very
important to generate

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.560
lots of other biomolecules.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.490
OK.

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:49.390
So, how do we make serine?

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:51.910
Well, if we go over
here, you'll see

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:56.500
that serine is downstream
of 3-phosphoglycerate

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.490
from glycolysis.

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:00.580
So what's 3-phosphoglycerate?

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:17.830
OK, here's 3-phosphoglycerate
from glycolysis, or the product

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:20.710
of rubisco if you like.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:23.330
So photosynthesis.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:27.610
So there's 3-phosphoglycerate.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:33.220
So if I oxidize this
alcohol to ketone,

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.900
electrons have to go somewhere.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:39.577
NAD+ reduced to NADH, I
get this intermediate.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:52.680
It's phosphohydroxypyruvate So
pyruvate with a phospho on it,

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.110
hydroxypyruvate.

01:02:55.110 --> 01:03:01.330
This molecule can undergo
a transamination reaction.

01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:04.410
So pick up nitrogen
from glutamate,

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.180
make the alpha-keto acid.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:26.290
Take this alpha-keto acid
and generate phosphoserine.

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:30.040
The amino acid that's
phosphorylated, phosphoserine.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.790
And then all I need to
do is dephosphorylate it,

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:37.400
and I end up with the
amino acid serine.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.730
Cool.

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:40.320
All right.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.020
To make glycine from serine--

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:48.030
so remember, glycine is one
basically the amino acid

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:49.690
with no side chain on it.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:53.970
So I need to remove this
carbon and the alcohol.

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:57.170
So I'll just redraw
serine this way.

01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:08.420
So that's redrawing serine.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:12.830
Need to lose that
group to get glycine.

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:19.800
This is helped along
by pyridoxal phosphate.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:34.290
So a reminder, this is
pyridoxal phosphate.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:56.760
OK.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.420
So this is exactly what we
drew, is the first steps

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.300
in transamination.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:09.600
Except if instead of
basically going like this,

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:18.240
I do this to break this
carbon-carbon bond,

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.480
what do I get?

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.630
Well, I release a
one-carbon unit.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:28.470
In this case, it's
the one-carbon unit

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:30.420
as formaldehyde.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.190
The one-carbon
aldehyde, formaldehyde.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:07:05.420
And generate this intermediate.

01:07:54.410 --> 01:08:03.340
And it's just exactly what we
showed before for resolving

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.950
the transamination.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:33.890
And I am left with glycine, as
well as I regenerated pyridoxal

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:39.060
phosphate for the next
catalytic cycle of the enzyme.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.840
And so illustrates
the flexibility

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.370
of pyridoxal phosphate.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:48.380
In this case, helping
convert serine into glycine

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:54.140
and a one-carbon unit
shown here as formaldehyde.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.430
Now the enzyme that
carries out this reaction

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:05.510
is an enzyme called
SHMT, which stands

01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:11.277
for serine
hydroxymethyltransferase.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.700
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:31.370
And it actually doesn't release
the formaldehyde directly.

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:34.609
Instead, it transfers
that formaldehyde

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:40.460
to an important one-carbon donor
for many one-carbon reactions

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:44.760
that is called folate
species or folic acid.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.590
So remember, if we transferred
CO2 in a carboxylation

01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.080
reaction, we use
a cofactor biotin.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.720
Biotin's useful to transfer CO2.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.720
But if we're going to do
something like transfer

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.830
the methyl groups shown up there
for choline synthesis, that's

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.650
transferring carbon that's
more reduced than CO2,

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:05.570
and you don't use
biotin for that.

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:08.990
Instead, you use
a cofactor called

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:14.930
folate that's derived from
the vitamin folic acid.

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:20.990
So folic acid, very
important vitamin.

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:25.760
It's the primary thing that's
included in prenatal vitamins.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.630
Why is that?

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:30.560
Because deficiency in folic
acid was shown a while back

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.240
to cause neural tube defects--

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.740
so developmental defects where
the neural tube does not close.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.650
This leads to things
like spina bifida.

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:43.190
One of the real successes of
public health intervention

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:47.510
was the recognition of this
and fortifying various cereals

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.160
with folic acid.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.060
And doing so has greatly
reduced the incidence

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:57.980
of these birth defects
involving folate deficiency.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.950
Folate deficiency's also
a common cause of anemia.

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:03.350
And so folic acid is a
vitamin that lots of people

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:05.570
take for that reason.

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:09.140
And in fact, folic acid, also
very important in the history

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.402
of cancer treatment.

01:11:10.402 --> 01:11:12.110
And if you want to
learn more about that,

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:17.240
take 745, which is
offered in the fall.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.590
All right.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:22.970
So, folic acid is
a complex molecule

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:31.670
that is converted in cells to
a molecule called THF, which

01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:33.866
stands for tetrahydrofolate.

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:46.040
So I'll draw out folic acid
for you and tetrahydrofolate.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:38.140
OK.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:43.210
So, this here is folic acid.

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:46.360
The folic acid molecule
is tetrahydrofolate.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.100
It has a peptide bond here
to a glutamate molecule,

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.190
and it's actually a
polyglutamate tail that

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:56.950
is there to trap it in cells.

01:12:56.950 --> 01:13:08.390
It's this central part
of the molecule here

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:11.540
that actually carries
the one-carbon unit.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.230
And so the way that the
nitrogens are numbered,

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.100
this is nitrogen-5.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.920
This is nitrogen-10.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.840
That will be
important in a minute.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:26.340
But it's really this
sort of central part here

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.820
of the molecule that I will
draw over and over again

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:35.690
as the one-carbon
unit-carrying species.

01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:37.790
To show how this
works, it's easier

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:42.380
if I start off by showing
how it can pick up a more

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.700
oxidized one-carbon unit.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:51.950
So the one-carbon carboxylic
acid is this, that's formate.

01:13:51.950 --> 01:14:03.190
And so if I phosphorylate
formic acid,

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:06.985
this formic acid can then
be picked up by the--

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:27.990
so here's that carrying
part of the one-carbon--

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:31.620
the box part of
tetrahydrofolate.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:44.120
And so this can pick up
formic acid like this.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.420
OK.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.550
So that gives us
this molecule, which

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:15.070
is called
N10-formyltetrahydrofolate,

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:16.960
THF.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.800
I can create a ring
out of this molecule.

01:15:28.545 --> 01:15:29.045
This.

01:15:50.572 --> 01:15:51.080
OK.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:16:03.505
And if I remove water from this
ring, we draw it like this.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:23.230
OK.

01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:34.480
This is called
N5,N10-methenyl THF.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:57.480
And if I reduce that
molecule, it's NADPH.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:07.545
So hydride ion.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.260
OK.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:38.880
Then I end up with
this molecule,

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:50.240
which is N5,N10-methylene THF.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:18:11.990
And if I further
reduce this molecule,

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:26.580
then I end up with
this molecule,

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:36.270
which is N5-methyl THF.

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:41.850
Appears incredibly complex
what's going on here,

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:45.060
but I went through this, because
what I want you to realize

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.180
is that each of these
species are simply

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:51.600
tetrahydrofolate carrying
a one-carbon unit

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.050
in a different oxidation state.

01:18:55.050 --> 01:19:00.660
So this N10 formyl THF
is carrying formic acid,

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.850
the one-carbon acid.

01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:07.710
I can reduce it to
N5,N10-methylene THF.

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:11.610
That's carrying the one-carbon
aldehyde, formaldehyde.

01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:13.260
Or I could reduce it further.

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:22.770
This is carrying the one-carbon
methyl group as N5-methyl THF.

01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:26.730
And it turns out that this
allows a lot of flexibility

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:29.490
in carrying out
one-carbon reactions.

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:33.690
Here is a same thing
written from a textbook.

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:37.530
The direction-- the order is
shown a little bit differently,

01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:39.270
the molecules are rotated.

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.550
And it includes a
couple other species

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:43.812
that are added in for
histodine metabolism.

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.270
But if you look at
this, you'll see

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:48.390
it's exactly what
I just drawn where

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:50.670
you get these key species.

01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:58.830
Where N5-methyl
THF is effectively

01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:00.970
carrying a methyl group.

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:03.090
So a one-carbon methyl donor.

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:17.490
N5,N10-methylene THF is
carrying the formaldehyde.

01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:32.610
And N10-formyl THF is
carrying the formate group

01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:35.250
to donate as a one-carbon unit.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:38.490
This will be the donor,
ultimately, for things

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.590
like choline synthesis.

01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:44.190
Formaldehyde-- and
N5,N10-methylene and formyl THF

01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:47.370
will be important in nucleic
acid synthesis and we'll see

01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:49.330
that next time.

01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:54.240
And so now if we go back
to our SHMT reaction,

01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.170
I can show you how these
things really work.

01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:11.960
And so here's a THF molecule.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:23.040
And so here is the intermediate
in serine-glycine conversion

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:36.890
found to pyridoxal
phosphate, et cetera.

01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:45.630
And that will release
glycine and eventually PLP.

01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:49.180
So glycine and PLP can
be generated from that.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:55.680
And what ends up here
on the folate is--

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:35.670
which is N5,N10-methylene THF.

01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:40.140
And if I take this
and I oxidize it,

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:44.070
I can take the
aldehyde to the acid.

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:45.870
So oxidation.

01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:48.630
NAD+ is reduced to NADH.

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:54.990
Now I get an N10-formyl THF.

01:22:54.990 --> 01:23:03.000
And if instead I reduce it,
so electrons from NADPH go

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.290
to NADP+.

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:07.110
So NADPH gets oxidized,
electrons go there.

01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:14.250
And then I get an N5-methyl THF.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:17.730
This gives me a donor
of methyl groups.

01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:22.250
This gives me a donor
of formyl groups.

01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:23.420
All right.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.880
Very last thing I want
to talk about today

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:32.540
is we'll talk a lot about how
we use the more oxidized species

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.120
next time to
generate nucleotides,

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.880
but I want to say a few
words about how these methyl

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.810
groups are used to be
involved in methylation

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:45.590
reactions, things like
choline synthesis shown up

01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:50.750
there, but also not
just choline synthesis.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:57.110
Also can be used for reactions
involved in, say, epigenetics.

01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:59.390
And so for those of
you who will never

01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:01.640
think about biochemistry
again after taking

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:04.310
this class but we'll take--

01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:06.560
think about genetics,
you'll certainly

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.630
know the gene
expression is controlled

01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:13.070
by methylation of DNA and
histones and things like that.

01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:15.630
Those methyl groups have
to come from somewhere,

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:20.240
and they come ultimately from
these methylation reactions,

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.610
the serine there.

01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:24.770
Now I don't have time
to go through all

01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:27.300
of one-carbon metabolism.

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.120
This is very complex.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.010
But it turns out
the one-carbon donor

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.832
for most methylation
reactions isn't N5-methyl THF,

01:24:34.832 --> 01:24:37.040
even though that's where
the methyl group comes from.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.080
It's actually this molecule.

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:05.720
So this here is the
amino acid methionine.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.260
And if I put it here onto an
adenine, what I end up with

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:35.610
is this molecule called
S-adenosylmethionine or SAM.

01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:38.520
This methyl group on
SAM is very labile.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.040
And so it is the
universal methyl donor

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.380
to be used in
methylation reactions,

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:50.640
choline synthesis, epigenetic
methylation of DNA or histones,

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.110
whatever.

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:54.510
And if you transfer
that methyl group off,

01:25:54.510 --> 01:26:09.920
you're left with this
non-proteinogenic amino acid

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.710
that's called homocysteine.

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:22.070
And that homocysteine
is here onto an adenine

01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:36.280
to make S-adenosylhomocysteine,
which is abbreviated as SAH.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:43.990
SAH picks up-- needs
to regenerate SAM.

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:46.480
Methyl group has to
come from somewhere.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:54.010
This comes from N5-methyl THF.

01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:56.710
Of course, generates THF.

01:26:56.710 --> 01:27:01.180
And then THF can pick up
another methyl group, ultimately

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.180
from serine-to-glycine
conversion and reduction

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:08.680
with NADH to make N5-methyl THF.

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:11.710
I show here on the
slide, here's just

01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:13.900
a picture of
one-carbon metabolism

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.030
that I took from
a review article.

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:19.330
And so here's SAM metabolism.

01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:21.730
Lots and lots of
complicated reactions

01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:24.490
that are linked to cystine
metabolism and polyamine

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:26.208
metabolism.

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:28.000
Obviously don't have
time to get into this,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.370
but I want you to appreciate
that this happens, where

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.980
SAM and SAH come from,
how they're involved

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:36.010
in one-carbon metabolism,
because this will come up

01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:38.950
again in your future
endeavors if you do something

01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:40.840
with biology.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.470
All right.

01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:46.370
Final topic next time is
nucleic acid metabolism,

01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:48.910
and then we will
have covered all

01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:51.190
of the basics of metabolism.

01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:52.740
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.924
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:04.329
[RUSTLING]

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:06.253
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.280
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.780
Great.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.570
Now let's dive into
the material today.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.770
So today's topic is
carbohydrates as well as

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.680
an introduction to
membrane structure.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.810
And from the very
first class, I believe

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.770
Professor Yaffe talked to you
about the four main classes

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.940
of biological molecules.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.000
So proteins and
amino acids, you've

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.070
spent a lot of time
talking about that.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.750
Nucleic acids is coming up.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.310
And the other two
are carbohydrates

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.920
or sugars and lipids.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.710
Today, we're really going
to focus most of the lecture

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
on carbohydrates, what
they are, structure,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.692
something about nomenclature.

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.900
And then at the end, we're
going to talk a little bit

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.140
about lipids and basic
membrane structure.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.330
Now carbohydrates and lipids are
really critical energy storage

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.840
molecules for cells.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.650
And when we talk
about metabolism--

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.630
the most interesting
part of this course--

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.300
after spring break,
we're going to delve

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.930
into this in a lot more detail.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.950
But sugars are also very
important to understand

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.640
nucleic acid structure.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.870
Turns out, membranes
are essential for signal

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.040
transduction.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.770
Those are the two major
topics that Professor Yaffe

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.110
is going to talk about
for the rest of his time.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.710
And so this year, we're going
to try something different

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.260
and have me introduce at
least some of these topics

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.600
now, which will deal with some
redundancies that otherwise

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.880
might have existed
and maybe set it up

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.830
better for him to discuss some
of the lectures coming up.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.710
Now today's lecture is
unfortunately topically

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.530
a little bit disjointed.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.240
But it still has important
information about biochemistry.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.330
And it will help us all
speak the same language,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.790
both for the upcoming lectures
from Professor Yaffe as well

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.140
as things that I will start
off with when I come back.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.720
And it's a nice way to ease
back in after the exam.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.220
OK.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.340
So what is a
carbohydrate or a sugar?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.460
So let's break this down,
and so it's carbohydrate.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.420
So a carbohydrate is
effectively carbon

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.310
in some ratio with water.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.590
So all carbohydrates have
the same chemical formula, Cn

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.030
and H2On.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.500
And so there are some
deviations from this in biology.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.890
Sometimes, you can introduce a
heteroatom, phosphate, sulfur,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.600
nitrogen, et cetera.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.820
Technically, these
are not carbohydrates,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.840
although they're often lumped
together with carbohydrates.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.160
And why would nature do this?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.710
Because it changes some
of the chemical properties

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.160
that can be useful for either
structural or signaling

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.090
reasons.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.120
You may encounter these later--

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.608
certainly, in other classes.

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:08.900
But we're not going to talk
much more about that today.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.783
We really just kind of focus
on the base carbohydrate,

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:15.200
Cn H2On structure.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.510
Now carbohydrates come
in different forms.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.420
And so they can come as single
units with that structure.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.068
These are so-called
monosaccharides.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.730
Or these single units
can come together

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.080
to form various polymers.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.470
And those polymers could be two
units, so-called disaccarides--

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.690
so two sugars stuck together.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.900
Or many units, and
so sometimes, those

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:12.300
are referred to as
oligosaccharides

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.980
or polysaccharides.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.089
And there's really
no clear distinction

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.020
between a few chains
together, oligosaccharides,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.880
many polysaccharides.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.350
They're somewhat
used interchangeably.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.320
Now you guys have
almost certainly

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320
heard of many of these things.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.830
So what's a monosaccharide?

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.840
So a good example
of that is glucose.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.930
So glucose is, of
course, the main sugar

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.240
that exists in your blood.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.430
What's a disaccharide?

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.470
So a common one is sucrose.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.110
So sucrose is a disaccharide--
so two sugars stuck together,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.580
glucose plus fructose.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.310
You've probably heard of
both of those things before.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.072
Sucrose is, of
course, table sugar.

00:04:59.072 --> 00:05:01.030
It's what you would have
mixed into your coffee

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.590
if you had that this morning.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.150
And an example of a
polysaccharide is starch--

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.460
so what's in a potato.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.660
All right.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.210
Now clearly, these
are all sugars.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.370
They're all relevant
to a human diet.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.690
You would never confuse--

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.600
you've probably not
knowingly tasted glucose.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.090
It's not particularly sweet.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.530
Sucrose is much sweeter.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.890
And a potato is not
necessarily sweet at all.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.590
Yet, this really points out
that how these sugars are built,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.840
the different
structures matter a lot.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.280
They matter for things like how
you taste them in your diet.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.030
And how carbohydrates
are built also

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.270
matters a lot for all kinds
of aspects of biology, which

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.720
is why it's somewhat important
to at least understand

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.450
some of what we're talking
about-- a common language

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.430
about how to describe
these molecules.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.770
OK.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.480
So the simplest
biological sugars

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.720
have three carbons that
are least commonly used.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.220
These are referred
to as trioses.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.890
And if we take the
general formula,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:20.220
C3 H2O3, and we say,
what are two ways that we

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.530
can satisfy that formula?

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.790
There's two main
ways we can do it.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.120
One is like this.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.140
So if you add up--

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.660
count all the carbons,
hydrogens, and oxygens,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.120
you will see that
that is C3 H2O3.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.120
This molecule is
called glyceraldehyde.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.640
OK.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.920
And the other way we can
do this is like this.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.580
OK.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.280
Again, three carbons,
three waters.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.920
If you add up all the
atoms, this molecule

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.810
is called dihydroxyacetone.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.050
And these are sugar--
same chemical formula,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.820
different chemical structure.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.020
That has a term.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.220
That's called an isomer.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.680
And it turns out that
we can chemically

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.290
interconvert these molecules
in the following way.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:46.390
And so if we carry
out this chemistry,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.867
we will get this intermediate.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.930
OK.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.550
And that will allow you to
interconvert glyceraldehyde--

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.620
this aldehyde-- with this
ketone, dihydroxyacetone.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.650
And the enzyme class
that carries this out

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.280
is a class of enzymes
called isomerases.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.080
And this is exactly
the chemistry

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.470
that that enzyme would
use to interconvert

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.390
these two forms of this
triose, this three-carbon sugar

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.049
molecule.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.370
All right.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.940
Now if we look at
dihydroxyacetone,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.950
there's no stereocenter here.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.780
What do I mean by
a stereocenter?

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.540
That's a carbon that
has-- reminder from 512--

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.920
carbon that has four different
non-equivalent substituents

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.010
around it.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.520
However, if you look
at glyceraldehyde,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.330
that carbon in the middle
is a stereocenter--

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.590
four non-equivalent
groups around it.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.640
And so there's two ways that
I can draw glyceraldehyde.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.960
I can draw it like this.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.070
Or I could draw it like this.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.890
All right-- so two
different ways.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.830
So the one on the left
here is D-glyceraldehyde.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.850
And the one on the right
is L-glyceraldehyde.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.660
OK.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.820
And I know that this is review.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.800
Some people are good
at seeing these things.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.990
Some people are not.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.530
I brought a couple
of models here.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.970
Here's this-- the
blue and the brown

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.510
are two stereocenters with four
different constituents on them.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.450
No way you can twist these
around to make them identical

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.740
molecules.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.890
Why does this matter?

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.850
Well, enzyme-active
sites are going

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.330
to fit this molecule
different than this molecule.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.820
And this is why
these stereoisomers

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.882
matter so much for biology.

00:10:41.882 --> 00:10:44.090
It's also something that's
really hard to accomplish.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.048
If you think about how
do you actually generate

00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:48.890
stereoisomers if you were in
an organic chemistry lab--

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.940
really hard.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.620
But biology does
this all the time.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.870
And the real reason
is because it's

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.260
enzymes that ultimately
catalyze these interconversions.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.450
And different stereoisomers
will fit differently

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.450
into enzyme-active sites.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.120
Now the way that I've
been drawing these sugars

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.240
is a convention called
a Fischer projection.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.260
And when drawn in this way,
the convention is that--

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.450
so you put the carbonyl
towards the top.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.820
If the OH group, the alcohol,
is pointing to the right,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.560
that's D. If it's pointing
to the left, that's L--

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.600
and so D, pointing to the
right, L, pointing to the left.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.050
Like amino acids, biology has
chosen one stereochemistry

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.950
for most biological
sugars because, of course,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.420
enzymes act on them.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:49.580
And so in biology,
it's D, sugars.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.900
This is in contrast
to L, amino acids.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.620
And so if you can remember
that sugars are D,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.480
you know that amino
acids are the opposite.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.250
Or if you remember
that amino acids are L,

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.830
you can remember that
sugars are the opposite.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.030
OK.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.200
All right.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.410
So dihydroxyacetone is
really the only sugar

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.670
with three or more carbons that
doesn't have a chiral center.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.320
Everything else will.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.390
And so if I go to a
four-carbon sugar--

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.560
draw a couple of them here.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:36.430
OK.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:42.290
So here's C4 H2O4
drawn with a ketone.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.170
If you look at this,
this is a chiral center.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.290
OH group is pointing
to the right.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.730
This is a D sugar.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.280
If I had drawn it with
the OH group on this side,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.790
it would be an L sugar.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.290
All right.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.000
If I draw this sugar as a
different isomer, this time

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:13.130
with an aldehyde, now, we
encounter a bit of an issue

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.280
because now I have
one, two stereocenters.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.200
OK.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.140
So if there's two
stereocenters, that

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.850
means there's 2 to
the n ways that I can

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.610
draw this as a stereoisomer.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.270
And so you can see that this
could get really complicated

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.990
very quickly.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:40.430
Now this sugar obviously is a
D because I drew both OH groups

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.080
pointing to the right.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.190
But you can imagine, I
could draw one this way

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.430
or one that way.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.920
And so how do if it's
a D or an L sugar?

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.350
And so the convention
is that whether or not

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.130
a sugar is designated
as D or L refers

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.280
to the stereocenter
that is furthest away

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.180
from the carbonyl.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.350
And so this is the
relevant stereocenter

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.120
that says it's a D sugar.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.870
So what do I mean?

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.470
I can draw.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.040
And then any other sugar
would have a different name.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.290
And so what do I mean by that?

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.260
Let me draw this a
few different ways.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.920
And so the sugar
that I've drawn here

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.125
is referred to as D-erythrose.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.670
All right.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:40.170
If I draw it, now the
OH group on the carbon

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.910
furthest from the carbonyl
pointing to the left,

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.850
so this would be L-erythrose.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:55.130
And if I draw it
differently by altering

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:05.390
the stereochemistry
of this carbon,

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.750
now, it has a different name.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.080
And so this carbon is D--

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.750
or this sugar is D-threose.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.780
All right.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.400
Makes sense.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.230
If I flip the OH group to this
side, it would be L-threose.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.730
All right.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.760
So lots of possibilities.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.890
Turns out nature only uses a
subset of the stereoisomers

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.320
and makes them
relevant for biology.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.510
For example,
D-erythrose is something

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.000
that you will encounter when
we talk about metabolism

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.290
later in the course.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.950
D-threose, as far as I know,
is not used in biology.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.230
I would never say, it's
never used in biology.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.520
Never bet against biology.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.330
It can do absolutely everything.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.370
There's always an
exception somewhere.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.370
But, in general,
D-threose is not

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:55.330
something that really exists,
at least commonly in nature.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.230
All right.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.420
So if we go through,
and you look

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:04.210
at all of these different
sugars that I've drawn,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.660
you can see that they
either have an aldehyde,

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.240
or they have a ketone
somewhere in the molecule.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.740
All right.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:17.990
So if you have an
aldehyde, these sugars

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.370
are generically
referred to as aldoses.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.420
All right.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.990
And if you have a ketone,
an internal carbonyl,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.950
these are generically
referred to as ketoses.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.780
Now you might say,
as you start getting

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.792
to longer and longer sugars,
you can put the ketone anywhere

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.500
along the sugar, and
there would be a ton

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.660
of different possibilities.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.300
But it turns out
ketoses always have

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:53.270
the carbonyl as the second
carbon in from the end.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.870
The reason for that
is because biology,

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.450
as you will see when we
talk about metabolism,

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.300
interconverts these via
isomerase reactions.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.599
And so you can't use
an isomerase reaction

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.000
to interconvert a
ketose and an aldose

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.510
unless the ketone is one carbon
away from the end of the sugar.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.569
And so this fact
really limits some

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:19.910
of the diversity of ketoses that
can actually exist in nature.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.720
Now most important
biological sugars,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.970
at least the most
common ones, end up

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.300
having six carbons
or five carbons.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.500
And these are referred
to as hexoses or aldose--

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.240
or pentoses.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.400
Sorry-- so much nomenclature.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.900
OK.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.030
So six-carbon
sugars are hexoses.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.820
Five-carbon sugars are pentoses.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.060
And if we just talk
about the hexoses,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.910
you're very familiar
with a couple of them.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.080
And so one that we mentioned
earlier, blood sugar--

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.670
glucose looks like this.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.900
So this molecule is D-glucose.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.460
It's a D sugar because
the stereocenter here

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.525
furthest from the carbonyl--

00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:29.140
OH group points to the right.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.290
So it's a D sugar.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.560
It's an aldose because
it has an aldehyde.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.370
All right.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.710
And it's a hexose because it
has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 carbons.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.680
And what makes it glucose
is the stereochemistry

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.380
of these other sites
that end up being-- this

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.020
is the molecule glucose.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.580
Now if I carry out
that isomerase reaction

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:05.377
that I showed you earlier,
it'll give me this intermediate.

00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:13.000
Let me draw the whole thing.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.340
Then I interconvert that aldose.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.845
Now, it becomes a ketose.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:49.770
This is D-fructose--
another common sugar that

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.080
certainly is in the news a lot.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.260
D sugar because the
stereocenter for this

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.930
from the carbonyl points to
the right, makes it a D sugar.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.030
It's a ketose.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.560
It's a hexose.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.050
This organization of
other stereocenters

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.490
is what makes it D-fructose.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.650
All right.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.620
Now if we go through
and we count these,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.120
there's four stereocenters in
glucose, three stereocenters

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.380
in fructose.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.820
That means 2 to the n.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:23.190
There are 16 ways I can
make ketose aldose, eight

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.980
ways I can make a ketose--

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.620
I'm sorry-- an aldose
hexose, eight ways

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.340
I can make a ketose hexose.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.160
Among those, that's
even 12 different ways

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.440
that I can have D hexoses that
are a ketose or an aldose.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.400
Could be very, very complicated.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:49.200
But it turns out, fructose is
the only D hexose ketose that

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.870
really is relevant for nature.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.530
There's only two other
molecules related to glucose--

00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:00.720
only two other hexose aldoses
that are sugars used in nature.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.510
You've probably heard
of these as well.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.330
I'll draw them to illustrate
a different point.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.030
OK.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:35.710
So this molecule is
galactose, an important sugar

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.930
found in milk.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.430
All right.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:22:03.810
If I draw a glucose next
to it again, glucose--

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:24.230
so these two sugars differ
here, the stereochemistry there.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.260
So they are, I guess,
isomers of each other.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.630
There's a special name for
it I will get to in a second.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.750
So that's how galactose
is related to glucose.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.140
The other major aldose
hexose is this one.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.495
This is D-mannose.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.840
This differs from glucose here--

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.000
that carbon at that carbon.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.430
By the way, by
convention, the way

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.640
that you number carbon
in sugars is you

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.820
start with the end that's
closest to the carbonyl, either

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.270
the aldehyde or the carbon
one up from the ketone,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.780
so this would be carbon
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.440
So galactose differs
from glucose at carbon 4.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.320
Glucose differs from
mannose at carbon 2.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.020
These isomers have names
in relation to each other.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.930
And so two sugars that differ
by one part of stereochemistry--

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.430
so galactose to glucose
or glucose to mannose--

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.310
are called epimers.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:58.670
And these can be or converted
by enzymes called epimerases.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.910
We'll talk about how these
work later in the course.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.510
And so glucose is an
epimer of galactose.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.850
Glucose is an epimer of mannose.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.210
Mannose is not an
epimer of galactose

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.965
because mannose and
galactose differ

00:24:12.965 --> 00:24:16.580
at both carbon 2 and carbon 4--

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.520
their stereochemistry.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.060
Why is that relevant?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.790
Because if you're
going to interconvert

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.890
galactose and mannose,
you would have

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.220
to do it in two steps, two
different epimerase reactions

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.300
to interconvert
those two sugars.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.570
All right.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.170
Great.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:42.330
So we've discussed now
all of the major hexoses

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.350
that nature uses.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:48.210
We've discussed all the major
trioses that nature uses.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.690
The other major
length of sugars that

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.580
ends up being important
in biochemistry

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.190
is the five-carbon
sugars, the pentoses.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.910
And so I want to mention
a couple pentoses

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:06.900
and do so in a way that will
allow me to basically solidify

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.990
some of the nomenclature
that I've gone through.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.650
And, of course, one of the
five carbon sugars-- ribose--

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.770
is really critical to
nucleic acid structure, which

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.740
is one of the reasons why
we're talking about this

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.060
at this point in the course.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.010
OK.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.200
So this is a pentose--

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5-carbon
sugar, D-ribose.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.990
All right.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.630
It's a D sugar because
the stereocenter furthest

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.870
from the carbonyl
points to the right.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.350
It's an aldose because
it has an aldehyde group.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.382
I can act on this
with an isomerase.

00:25:55.382 --> 00:25:58.830
I'm not going to draw out
the isomerase reaction again.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.840
It's exactly what I drew before.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.210
If I did this, now, I
turn this into a ketose.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.590
Pentose because
it's five carbons.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.960
Ketose because as a ketone.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.180
D sugar because the
stereocenter furthest

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.820
from the carbonyl
points to the right.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.040
This has a name of D-ribulose.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.570
All right.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.010
And it turns out that there
is an important epimer

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.170
of D-ribulose that's
found in nature.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.330
The epimer changes the
stereochemistry at carbon 3--

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.520
carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.960
That's carbon 3.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:53.420
And so if this was acted on
by an epimerase that did that,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:27:00.440
you get this sugar,
also a pentose,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:10.520
also a ketose, a D sugar,
but an epimer of ribulose.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.975
It's called D-xyulose.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.260
It's an epimer because
xyulose ribulose

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.120
are epimers because they differ
by stereochemistry only at one

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.290
position.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.850
I'll just say,
right off the bat,

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.910
you should not memorize names
of sugars and their structures.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.260
These are things you
can look up in books.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.940
The point of going
through all this

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.960
is just to expose you to
some of the nomenclature,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.570
remind you about
stereochemistry.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.980
I realize, these
are basic things.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.970
Many of you have already
encountered this.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.470
Some of you find this very easy.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:57.390
Some people find these sort of
spatial things more difficult.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.570
This is very well-reviewed,
though, in textbooks

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.350
or other places online if
you need to look it up.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.040
But the key thing is just to
remember this nomenclature

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.510
because it'll make it easier for
us to talk about sugars later

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.660
in the course.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.000
All right let's
take a short break,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.410
so I can get some
board space back.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:24.490
And then we'll build off some
of these concepts in a minute.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:29.890
I've been drawing all of these
sugars as straight chains.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.350
But you probably
know, from high school

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:36.730
or from looking at DNA or
RNA that the ribose there

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.080
is not a straight chain
but, instead, forms a ring.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.470
And, in fact in solution,
particular aqueous

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.870
solution, sugars, particularly
five carbons and longer almost

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.400
always exist as rings.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.770
And there is a very
clear reason for this.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.910
And you probably remember,
from 512 Organic Chemistry

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.900
that alcohols will react
with aldehydes and ketones

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.860
in solution.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.760
And so here, I have a model
of glucose and fructose

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.810
if you want to come
and play with them.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.130
And so if you look at this,
and you just look at the model,

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:17.440
you see that this oxygen, right
here, this alcohol, in space,

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.300
is very close or can be moved to
be very close to this aldehyde

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.040
here on the end of the molecule.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.200
Or the same thing
here with fructose.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.680
Here's a alcohol very close
in space with this ketone.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.190
All right.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:39.450
So what happens
in this situation?

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.940
Well, if you have--

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.080
this is a review of
organic chemistry.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.580
OK.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.760
So here's any generic aldehyde.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.980
Here's some alcohol.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:03.430
OK.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.090
So those things react.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:16.950
You end up with this
so-called hemiacetol.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:30.825
Or the same thing if I do it
with a ketone and an alcohol--

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:45.846
now you get this hemiketal.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.890
OK.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.430
Now given that you have
an alcohol reacting

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.280
with a carbonyl, an
aldehyde, or ketone

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.710
on the same molecule,
well, what happens

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.610
is you effectively
get a ring with oxygen

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.550
being one of the
components of the ring.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.020
And so if we draw
this for glucose--

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.740
so this is D-glucose.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.690
All right.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:47.380
And so if the alcohol here
on carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:53.170
interacts with the
aldehyde on carbon 1--

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.530
you can play with the
model and see that that is

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.780
the one that's close in space--

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.855
you now end up getting this.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:31.887
This, where you get a ring
between carbons 1 and 5.

00:32:31.887 --> 00:32:33.220
We can number the rest of them--

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.390
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.380
All right.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.180
Or if I turn this molecule
so that you can now draw it

00:32:43.180 --> 00:33:16.200
in a slightly more
chemically proper way,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.180
now, you basically have--

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:26.460
this is carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:33.570
So carbon 5, oxygen from
carbon 5 now bound to carbon 1

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.500
gives you this six-membered
ring structure.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.430
The six-membered ring structure
is reminiscent of an organic

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.330
molecule called a--

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.740
looks like that-- called pyran.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.540
And so this six-membered
ring in a sugar

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:59.540
is also referred
to as a pyranose.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.120
All right.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.300
So that's the first thing.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.030
The second thing is
that this whole business

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.219
can be very tedious to draw.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.830
In fact, it's very tedious
drawing sugars in general,

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:16.219
as I'm sure you would agree
with me if you're taking notes

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:17.540
during this lecture.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:24.679
And so oftentimes, these
pyranoses, like glucose,

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.840
are drawn with shorthand.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:37.440
And the shorthand is as follows,
where I basically represent

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.980
the OH groups as simply lines.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.610
And so this is another
shorthand to draw

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.760
that pyranose form of glucose--

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:54.810
again, carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.240
Now the last thing is you
can see I didn't draw the OH

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.100
group there on carbon 1.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.790
And that's because by
making this pyranose ring,

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.920
if you look at
carbon 1, I have now

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.700
generated a new stereocenter.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.650
And so carbon 1 now has four
non-equivalent groups on it,

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.490
which means I could draw
the OH group, that carbon 1,

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:18.700
in two different ways.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.150
And so this is carbon 1.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.900
I could draw it such that
the OH group points down.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:32.610
Or I could draw it such
that the OH group points up.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.250
And those are two
different molecules.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.400
And so there's a naming
convention for this too.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.490
And so if the OH
group points down

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:46.350
using this way of drawing the
molecule, it's called alpha.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.390
If the OH group points
up, it's called beta.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.710
All right.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.970
And so this alpha
versus beta ends up

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:03.620
being structurally different
because it puts, basically,

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:10.040
that OH group pointing in a very
different position in space.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.640
So if I make a ring
here with glucose,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.060
and the OH group is
pointing here versus there--

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.280
very different
position in space.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.900
And this has
implications for how

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.420
you build bonds
for disaccharides

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.750
and polysaccharides that
make structural differences.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:30.680
And we'll cover this a lot
when we get to metabolism.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.220
But it should be very
clear now that glucose,

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.130
if you just take a solution of
glucose and put it in water,

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.020
it is not one thing.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.870
There's actually multiple
different forms it can have.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.520
It could be as I drew it up
here with the OH group pointing

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.360
down.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.160
This would be alpha D-gluco--

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.990
because it's glucose--
pyranose, because it's

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.860
in the pyranose ring form.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.370
I could have drawn it with
the OH group pointing up--

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.900
different molecule.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.670
That would be Beta
D-glucopyranose.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:22.040
Or it could just be the
open-chain D-glucose

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.410
that I was drawing earlier.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.310
All right.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:29.690
All of those are perfectly
legitimate ways for glucose

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.640
to exist in solution.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.510
All right.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.480
Now it turns out, that
in reality, about a third

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.770
of it in solution is this.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.120
Two thirds is that.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.340
And a trace amount is this.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.600
OK.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.000
And that has to
do with just what

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.910
is more favorable forms or not.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:54.710
But which form it's in actually
matters for structural reasons,

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.520
as we'll see later
in the course.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.480
Now the final complexity is
that this ring is not flat.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:08.570
So if I actually take glucose
here and make a form of it--

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.100
so here's my glucose molecule.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.030
There's no way for me to
make this completely flat,

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.190
say, like benzene.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:19.220
And so there's really
two different pyranose

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.400
confirmations that
can be formed.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.740
I'll try to draw them, but
they're harder to draw.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:29.720
Here's a overhead that you
can look at if it's easier.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:38.370
But basically, you can have it
form this so-called boat form

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:46.100
or this so-called chair form.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:52.250
So there's the boat versus
the chair conformation.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:57.260
Glucose, turns out, prefers
the chair conformation.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.180
And there's an
interesting thing that

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:05.150
comes from this because if
you take beta D-glucopyranose,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.470
it turns out of all
the hexoses that

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:15.350
exist in possible hexoses that
exist, the form of a hexose

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:19.430
aldose that best spreads
out all the hydroxyl groups

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:27.000
is beta D-glucopyranose, the
more common one in solution.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.230
Why does this matter?

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.460
Well, because if this has this
reactive aldehyde bound up

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.070
in this stable ring
structure, it's

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.890
less likely to react with
other aldehydes in the cell.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.200
And so this is likely why nature
chose D-glucose as the most

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.830
common storage sugar-- why
it's sugar in your blood--

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:51.260
because it's the most stable
hexose that's out there.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.890
And it's not just
a random reason

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.200
that nature picked
this one, but actually

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.350
because of real
chemical stability

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.810
issues for why it's there.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.040
All right.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.890
Now I want to mention that
ketoses also can form rings.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.810
And I'm going to use
this as an example

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.495
to show you that a ketose--
so here's fructose.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.690
So this is D-fructose.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.260
And so it turns out, this
can form two possible rings.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.200
It can form a five-membered
ring or six-membered ring.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.900
So how do I form a
five-membered ring?

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:54.770
So if I take the carbon
here from carbon 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:40:54.770 --> 00:41:00.500
5, the hydroxyl from carbon
5, form a ring there.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.020
Now, I get this molecule.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:30.410
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.950
OK.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:34.220
Or if I now turn this
so that I draw it

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:52.270
in the way you're probably
more used to seeing it,

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.250
I'm going to use
the shorthand here.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:03.750
So this here would be
carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:09.030
hydroxyl from carbon 5,
forming a bond to carbon 2.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.140
That creates a new
stereocenter at carbon 2.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.430
OH group is pointing up.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:19.230
So this is a beta sugar--

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.890
OH group pointing up.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:28.410
So this here, as I drew
it, would be beta D-fructo

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.260
and this is a furanose.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.100
Why is that?

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.190
Because the organic
molecule that's

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:39.240
a five-membered ring with
an oxygen in it is a furan.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.340
And so the five-membered ring
is referred to as a furanose--

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.545
beta D-fructofuranose.

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:48.570
If I'd drawn it with the
OH group pointing down,

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.610
it would be alpha
D-fructofuranose.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:52.110
OK.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.840
There's another
possible ring I can do.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:01.590
And instead, I take the hydroxyl
from carbon 6 and do that--

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.700
form a ring.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.680
Now I'm going to form
a six-membered ring.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:37.450
We have carbon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.420
So if I now turn this--

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.540
so this, here, now I drew
the OH group pointing down.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.270
So it's an alpha.

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.430
If I drew it up,
it would be beta.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.000
So this is alpha
D-fructofuranose--

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:24.240
six-membered ring version of
fructose, five-membered ring

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.780
version of fructose.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:30.900
So lots of non-equivalent
ways I can draw fructose.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.990
And it turns out,
these actually matter.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.670
And they matter for real things
that probably matter to you.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:42.150
And so I brought with me here
two different sweeteners.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.740
This is corn syrup.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.970
This is honey.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.220
Has anyone ever-- I'm sure
most of you have had honey.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.740
Has anyone ever
tasted corn syrup?

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.240
Come on.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.300
Someone's tasted corn syrup.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.290
Is a sweet?

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.250
Which one's sweeter?

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.102
Honey, by far-- much,
much, much sweeter.

00:45:00.102 --> 00:45:02.560
I used to have it so you guys
could come up and taste them.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.640
But I couldn't
come up with a way

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.020
to do that in a sanitary way.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.990
So I gave up on it.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.280
But nonetheless-- much
sweeter than that.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.157
It turns out, these
are not pure fructose.

00:45:11.157 --> 00:45:12.490
They're a combination of sugars.

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.650
But their composition
is actually,

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.620
from a chemical
standpoint, similar amounts

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.260
of fructose in each one.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:26.450
And it turns out that honey
is beta D-fructopyranose.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:30.910
Whereas corn syrup is
beta D-fructofuranose.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:31.810
All right.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:35.575
So same sugar, different
structure-- one's a furanose,

00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:37.090
one's a pyranose--

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.020
tastes very differently to
you, one being much more sweet,

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.720
one being much less sweet.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.950
OK.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:49.330
Now, of course, I also want to
talk about ribose because it's

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.760
the thing that
you guys are going

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.120
to talk about the most next
because it's in nucleic acids.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.380
And so just as a
reminder, here's ribose.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.870
It's a aldose and a pentose.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.550
So this is D-ribose.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:17.500
Ribose, as from high school,
forms five-membered rings.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:22.360
That's because it links
alcohol on carbon 4

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.760
to the aldehyde on carbon 1.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.290
And that gives you
this ring structure.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.090
Now number of carbons--

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.180
1, 2, 3, 4--

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.900
alcohol on carbon
4, forming a ring

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.790
to the aldehyde on carbon 1.

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:52.820
This is carbon 5.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:56.370
And the way I drew it,
OH group pointing up--

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:04.220
so this is beta D-ribofuranose
would be the proper way

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220
to have it.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.615
And so when you guys
talk about this in DNA,

00:47:08.615 --> 00:47:11.060
well, the base is going
to be linked to carbon 1.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.270
It's going to replace
that hydroxyl group--

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.900
the beta form of the hydroxyl
group with the nitrogen.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.270
And you're going to talk
about bonds being from the 5

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.850
prime or the 3 prime end.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.630
Those are those hydroxyl groups.

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.610
That's where 5 prime
and 3 prime comes

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:30.510
from because those are the 5
and the 3 position on ribose.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:32.520
Great.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.370
Perfect.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:33.870
All right.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:42.090
So we will return to
carbohydrates in great detail.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:47.130
We'll discuss how we combine
different carbohydrates,

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.830
different monosaccharides
to make disaccharides

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.880
and polysaccharides, how these
different structural properties

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.560
end up mattering for
things like energy storage

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.790
as well as to produce various
structural molecules that

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:07.410
can be important for
different cells in organisms.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.610
But for the remaining
part of the class today,

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.640
I really want to shift
topics to now discuss

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.810
a completely different
class of biomolecules.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:20.640
And that's lipids.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.370
So as I said earlier, the
reason we're going to do this

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:28.530
is because coming up for
Professor Yaffe's lectures,

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.010
lipids end up being
really important molecules

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.320
for various aspects
of cell signaling.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.760
They're also very important
for energy transduction,

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.250
which is why I'm talking
about them as well.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:43.350
We will spend a lot
of time later talking

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:45.270
about lipids in great detail.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.310
But really, what I
want to focus on today

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:50.820
is how lipids are used
to create membranes.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:55.500
That is, barriers that really
separate the outside world

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:59.070
from the inside of cells,
things that make compartments

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:02.910
within cells, and
these things also

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:07.390
end up being surfaces where
you can have key things happen.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.120
So you reduce spatial
complexity if you

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.030
go to a 2D surface
versus a 3D surface,

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.510
which is part of why they're
so important in signal

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.890
transduction.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.160
But to talk about these,
I have to introduce, first

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.450
of all, what is a lipid?

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.180
So lipids are a
class of molecules.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.280
You think of them as fats.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.340
That's how they fit in the
nutritional standpoint of what

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.060
we'll all talk about.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.630
But first, I want to
give a general definition

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.760
of what a lipid is.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.280
Now there's lots of
different classes of lipids.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.020
And we'll cover these
later in the course.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.380
But in general, at
the highest level,

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:50.250
almost all lipids
consist of two pieces--

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.760
consist of something
called a fatty acid that's

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.710
esterified to an alcohol.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.710
So what is a fatty acid?

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:07.770
Well, a fatty acid is
really any molecule that

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:11.790
has a carboxylic acid group.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.160
So there's a carboxylic acid.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.100
And then hooked up to
that carboxylic acid

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:25.380
is a whole bunch of saturated
hydrocarbons-- alkyl chains.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:31.410
Oftentimes, fatty acid would be
drawn like this because of all

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.590
the different saturated chains.

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:39.060
So acid group on one
end, really greasy alkyl

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.390
chain on the other.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:47.520
And it turns out that this can
be esterified to an alcohol.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.320
So here's just a
generic alcohol.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:59.710
And as you certainly remember
from organic chemistry,

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:03.640
I can use an alcohol and
an acid to form an ester.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.170
And so then that would be--

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:17.370
so now, I have, basically,
this ester bond.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:21.180
And this is esterification
between some lipid species

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:26.130
and a fatty acid, in
general, is the general thing

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:31.360
that leads to a class of
molecules known as lipids.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.290
Now why this is particularly
useful for biology

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:44.130
is that this long, greasy alkyl
chain is not water soluble.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.980
So if you take oil
from your cabinet--

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.800
canola oil, or olive
oil, or whatever, and you

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.880
pour it in water, what happens?

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.330
It doesn't mix together.

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:58.870
You get these globs of
oil floating in the water.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:02.730
And so if you want to
form a barrier between two

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:06.330
aqueous compartments, a
way to do this is to have,

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.370
basically, a hydrophobic layer--

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:15.150
a membrane-- basically separate
the two aqueous compartments,

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:17.980
the inside and the
outside of the cell.

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:23.940
Now if I take a lipid, and
the lipid, I form this ester,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:29.020
and it doesn't have a charged
group anywhere on the molecule,

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:35.250
this is sometimes referred
to as a neutral lipid.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.050
So what do I mean
by neutral lipid?

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:41.580
It's basically taking this,
which is intrinsically

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.220
a fatty acid, is intrinsically
a polar molecule.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:48.120
It has this carboxylic
acid on the end of it.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.910
But if I form an ester
linkage to an alcohol,

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.370
and the alcohol has
no charge on it,

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.710
now, it's just this
really greasy molecule.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:58.860
And it turns out, that's exactly
what is in your olive oil

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.590
or in your canola
oil in your cabinet.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:05.310
It's basically a
bunch of fatty acids--

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:09.780
long alkyl chains esterified
to non-charged alcohols,

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.550
which makes this neutral lipid,
this greasy molecule, which

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:17.910
is great for energy storage
in plants, something

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:19.600
we'll talk about.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.570
But if you want to mix
it together with water,

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:22.920
it doesn't do very well.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.420
So if you go to
make salad dressing,

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.340
and you pour your oil
in with your vinegar,

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.770
the aqueous thing, you
get a bunch of droplets.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.875
You don't get a solution.

00:53:30.875 --> 00:53:32.250
And if you think
about it, that's

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.220
not very good at generating
an interface between two

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.065
compartments.

00:53:36.065 --> 00:53:37.440
You just get a
bunch of droplets.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.390
You actually don't
get an interface

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:41.760
between two compartments.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.410
So if you want to
make an interface,

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.970
you have to do
something different.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:50.100
You need to have a charge group,
like on this fatty acid, that's

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.360
going to be happy sticking
towards the aqueous side

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.440
and then a hydrophobic portion
that's going to be happy

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.410
sticking to form a barrier.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:05.350
Effectively, that's
what soap is.

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.380
So if you want to wash your
hands and use canola oil,

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.013
it doesn't work
very well, right?

00:54:11.013 --> 00:54:13.180
But what happens if you
have a bunch of greasy stuff

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.330
in the water, and you take a
drop of dawn dish detergent

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.740
and drop it in the water?

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:21.160
You get this immediate
barrier that forms

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.460
across the top as you get
this film where you basically

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:26.980
align up all these
charged hydrophilic parts

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:31.000
to the aqueous pieces and
all of the greasy parts

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.550
to the hydrophobic side.

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:38.860
So you end up having this
nice charged molecule

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.840
with this long hydrophobic part.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:49.320
So you have a hydrophilic
end and a hydrophobic end.

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:55.890
And that ends up being
very useful as a way

00:54:55.890 --> 00:55:01.800
to form an aqueous
hydrophobic interface.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.590
And this is exactly
how soap works,

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.750
as I'm sure you've
learned in other classes.

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:09.570
As an aside, you know
how you make soap?

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:14.490
You basically boil the
neutral lipids in lye.

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.350
So boiling it in
base, if you remember

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.620
from organic chemistry, will
break the ester linkage.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.630
And now, you have
these molecules.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.610
And that's how you make soap.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.570
All right.

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:27.180
Now the way biology does
this is they actually

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:32.040
assemble lipids that effectively
have that same property, where,

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.990
basically, they have a head
group from the alcohol that's

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:41.040
charged with a hydrophobic
group contributed

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.920
from these fatty acids.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:48.460
And this is what allows things
to assemble into membranes.

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:52.980
And so membranes are largely
made up of-- and certainly,

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.400
for the purposes of
the upcoming lectures--

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.240
so-called phospholipids.

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.063
So what is a phospholipid?

00:56:03.063 --> 00:56:07.800
Well, on a phospholipid, the
alcohol part of the lipid

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:13.110
is derived from a
molecule called glycerol.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.540
So glycerol looks like this.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.560
OK.

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.060
So this is glycerol.

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.480
All right.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.470
3-carbon molecule--
three alcohols--

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:36.520
actually, very similar.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.100
If you look back in your
notes to dihydroxyacetone,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.160
the difference between
glycerol and dihydroxyacetone

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.790
is carbon 2 was an alcohol
here before it was a ketone.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.720
Turns out, that's where glycerol
comes from-- dihydroxyacetone

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.120
getting turned into glycerol.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.010
And basically,
what a phospholipid

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:58.080
is that you esterify
a fatty acid

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:03.390
to two of the alcohols
and another phosphate

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:08.560
and charged alcohol to
the other hydroxyl group.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.670
So what do I mean by that?

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:15.630
So like this-- so here's
ester linkage number one.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:18.330
I'll draw it this
way just for ease.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.790
This is the carbon 2.

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.990
Here's ester linkage number two.

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:29.580
So that's a fatty acid
esterified to 2 and 3.

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:35.550
And then you now make
an ester to a phosphate.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:43.100
So there's a
phosphate at carbon 1.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.420
And then you make another ester
linkage to another alcohol

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.810
where R equals alcohol.

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:54.800
And that alcohol also
turns out to be charged.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:02.000
And so the most common
phospholipid membrane lipid

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:12.840
is a molecule called
phosphatidylcholine,

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:17.975
which is that structure with
the R group being this alcohol.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.410
And so this is choline.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:41.250
OK and so phosphatidylcholine
is basically that structure.

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:11.250
OK.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:14.800
So this is phosphatidylcholine
drawn out in all of its glory.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:22.760
So you have this
hydrophilic end.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.500
Here, you have a
hydrophobic end.

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:30.960
That's good.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.780
This can point towards
the aqueous side.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.660
This can point towards
the greasy side

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.780
and make a nice interface.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:43.190
And so another common word
for phosphatidylcholine--

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:44.750
an old word for it--

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:48.580
is a molecule called lecithin.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.235
Anyone read the labels on
the side of your food ever?

00:59:52.235 --> 00:59:53.830
In fact, there's
an old commercial

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.090
that makes fun of this.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.030
Soy lecithin?

00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.530
What's that?

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:59.050
I don't want that
in my ice cream.

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:00.190
Well, what is lecithin?

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.450
It's phosphatidylcholine.

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:03.830
It's basically,
why is this done?

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.950
Well, it's commonly
added to ice cream

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:07.090
because what is ice cream?

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.490
And it's an emulsion
between fat,

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:14.650
the cream, and sugar, which
is pretty aqueous solubles,

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:17.860
you might guess, from looking
at what we drew earlier today.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.050
And so by putting
phosphatidylcholine

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:24.640
in your ice cream, you basically
stabilize this emulsion

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.680
between the aqueous
and the fat face.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.930
So this is why it's
added to lots of food.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:32.350
And in fact, it says, soy
lecithin, an emulsifier.

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:34.360
That's why it's added.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.650
You can do this yourself.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.363
This is a common trick
that many cooks know.

01:00:38.363 --> 01:00:40.780
So if you make salad dressing,
you put a little mayonnaise

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.760
in your salad dressing.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.750
Why do you do that?

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.130
Well, mayonnaise has eggs in it.

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.410
Eggs have a lot of
phosphatidylcholine.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:50.920
That mayonnaise that you
add into your salad dressing

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.410
basically stabilizes
that emulsion

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:57.100
between the oil in the vinegar
and helps it be more stable

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.830
and distribute better
across your lettuce.

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.410
I think my favorite
example of this

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:04.450
is, who's made
chocolate chip cookies?

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:05.740
Everyone's done this, right?

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.560
OK.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.930
So how do you make
chocolate chip cookies?

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:13.120
So you take butter and sugar,
all right, fat, and something

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.200
that's very non--

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.035
very polar, aqueous
soluble sugar.

01:01:17.035 --> 01:01:18.410
And you try to
mix them together.

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:19.840
You have to cream it, right?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.680
And that takes forever.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.350
It's a pain in the butt.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.767
It doesn't come
together very well.

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:27.850
And so you get lazy, and
you put the egg in there.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:31.000
And then it all comes together
really, really easily.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.020
So why is that?

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.130
The egg is the emulsifier that
actually brings it together.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.880
Whereas trying to get
the butter and sugar

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.070
to make your cookies
nice and fluffy

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.760
is a lot harder
because you're really

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760
trying to get these two
things to come together.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.820
And it's basically
this exact chemistry

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:50.540
that's taking place when you're
doing that act of cooking.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.520
All right.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.850
Now phosphatidylcholine is
not the only phospholipid

01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.890
found in membranes.

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:05.150
But I'll just quickly mention
what a couple of the other ones

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.650
are.

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:18.050
So it turns out you have two
other major phospholipids

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:21.110
by abundance and then
another phospholipid that's

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:22.610
really important for signaling.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.750
So I'll list them here first.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:43.710
So there's phosphatidylserine,
phosphatidylethanolamine

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.870
These, it turns out,
phosphatidylcholine,

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:48.150
phosphatidylserine,
phosphatidylethanolamine is

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:51.390
what makes up the majority
of the phospholipids in cell

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:52.420
membranes.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.440
And then there is a much
more minor phospholipid

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.770
that's important for signaling,
which is phosphatidylinositol.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.330
So what are these?

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.340
So serine, ethanolamine,
and inositol

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.540
are just, like choline,
different alcohols

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.540
that can be esterified to
the phosphate in exactly

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.810
the same way I did for
phosphatidylcholine.

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:18.840
And so what's
phosphatidylserine?

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.720
So if you remember, this is--

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.230
so this here is the
amino acid serine.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:35.760
I'm sure you remember that.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:04:00.230
If we esterify that
alcohol to the phosphate,

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:02.180
there's phosphatidylserine.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.930
What's ethanolamine look like?

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:20.125
So ethanolamine is this alcohol.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.020
So that's ethanolamine.

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:49.130
Esterify the alcohol
to phosphate.

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:52.100
Esterify that
phosphate to glycerol--

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:05.040
phosphatidylethanolamine.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.820
And the last one is inositol.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.680
So what is inositol?

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:22.070
Well, inositol is a
six-membered hydrocarbon rain

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:31.370
where all of the carbons
have an alcohol on them.

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:35.990
And so if I esterify one of
these alcohols on inositol,

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.640
versus a--

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.530
if I esterify one
of those alcohols

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:50.420
to a phosphate to make
phosphatidylinositol,

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.530
turns out that that ends up
being a really useful lipid

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:56.150
to make for signaling.

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:59.540
And you'll hear a lot about
this in a couple of contexts,

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.360
I believe, from Professor
Yaffe later in the course.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:03.860
All right.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:12.695
So this having these
general membrane structure

01:06:12.695 --> 01:06:16.370
or this general
phospholipid structure,

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:20.360
where you have this hydrophobic
part of the molecule

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.970
and the hydrophilic
part of the molecule

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:26.870
is really what allows these
lipids to come together

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:34.070
to form these membrane bilayers
that are often drawn like this.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:37.130
And so when I'm
drawing it like this,

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:40.670
basically, what
those two wavy lines

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:47.420
represent-- those are the
hydrophobic fatty acid parts,

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:53.865
and this is the hydrophilic
so-called head group.

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:03.222
That's the charged alcohol
stuck on to the end of the--

01:07:03.222 --> 01:07:07.200
to the phosphate
on the glycerol.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.240
And these, of
course, assemble such

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.930
that all of the
hydrophilic head groups

01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:18.075
face an aqueous
compartment on either side.

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:23.740
OK.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:30.770
And then you have this
nice hydrophobic portion

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:31.860
that is a membrane.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.520
And that is what
can create a barrier

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.720
between two different
compartments in cells.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.430
Now just to put
this into context

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:45.660
for the protein structure
stuff that you learned about--

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.580
so when you learn about
all the different ways

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.230
you have protein
structure, of course,

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:51.090
you have amino acids
that are hydrophilic,

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:53.180
amino acids that
are hydrophobic.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.650
If you have a protein
that's floating in solution,

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.810
it has all the hydrophilic
parts on the outside

01:07:57.810 --> 01:08:00.520
and the hydrophobic
parts in the middle.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.760
But you can imagine
that you can also

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.060
have proteins that
assemble to sit such

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.812
that they span the membrane-- so
hydrophobic parts that interact

01:08:09.812 --> 01:08:11.520
with the hydrophobic
part, the inner part

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.860
of the membrane-- hydrophilic
parts on either side.

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.020
These can form channels.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.279
These can form all kinds of ways
to move stuff across membranes.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:24.300
Or you might think that you
might have a protein that

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.430
does something like that--

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:29.620
hydrophobic part on one end,
hydrophilic part on the other,

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:34.109
and really floats on the
surface of a membrane.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.290
And you will see that the
way cell signaling works

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:41.880
is that you basically have
lots of protein complexes

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.560
that will assemble
that membranes--

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.479
two dimensional space.

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:49.290
Those membranes, as well as
some of the membrane lipids,

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:52.529
can then act as messengers
that allow cells to carry out

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:53.760
various signals.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.109
And I will leave that to
Professor Yaffe to talk about.

01:08:58.109 --> 01:08:59.430
All right.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:02.970
So I will also come back
and discuss membranes

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.300
in a very different context
in the context of metabolism

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.100
during the second
half of the course

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.439
because it turns out, a
lot of energy transduction

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:12.960
and the way cells
really store energy also

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.029
ends up being really important
with respect to membranes.

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:17.529
All right.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:18.321
You guys are lucky.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.955
You get out a little
bit early today.

01:09:20.955 --> 01:09:22.330
This is the first
time that we've

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:24.550
done the lectures this way,
so I don't have my timing

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:26.590
quite right.

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:31.330
But I will see you guys
again for metabolism

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.360
after spring break.

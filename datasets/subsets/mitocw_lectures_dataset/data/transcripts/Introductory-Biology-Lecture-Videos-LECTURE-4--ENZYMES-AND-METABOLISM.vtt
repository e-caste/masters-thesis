WEBVTT

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:17.590
PROFESSOR: So what are
we going to do today?

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.180
So, today we're going to
continue with amino acids,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.980
peptides, and proteins.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.140
And I want to talk about
a different protein

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.280
variant that is the causative,
the cause of sickle cell

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.850
anemia.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.460
And it's a very interesting
structural issue.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.310
But let me very briefly
recap what we did last time

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.800
and then talk to
you a little bit

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.750
about a process known
as denaturation.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.550
So last time, we discussed
how the primary sequence

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
of a polypeptide chain
defines its folded structure.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.970
The folded structure
is put in place

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.050
with secondary and
tertiary interactions,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.210
non-covalent interactions.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.950
Secondary just amongst
backbone and its tertiary sort

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.520
of everything else, even
including backbone amides,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.650
but either with water, or
a side chain, and so on.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.060
And then there are some
proteins that dissociate

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.980
into quaternary structure.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.650
So these monomer subunits,
as they would be called--

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.920
and I'm going to depict this
as a closed circle or an open

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.730
circle--

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.220
may form dimers of some kind.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.020
The dimers may be heterodimers.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.880
Or they may be homodimers.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.220
Or you could form trimers,
tetramers, and so on.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.700
And when we talk
about hemoglobin,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.390
which is the protein that
gets, that has a problem--

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.640
that is the cause of
sickle cell anemia,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.640
you'll see that that is a
heterotetrameric protein.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.520
So in this sort
of rendition, you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.370
would kind of draw it like this
where there are four subunits.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.860
Two are of one flavor
and two are of the other.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
And that's the quaternary
structure of hemoglobin.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.620
Now proteins fold.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.340
There are weak forces that
are holding them together.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.240
But there's a lot
of weak forces.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.750
But if you subject a protein
to various treatments that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.140
may break up those weak
forces, the protein

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.810
will undergo a process
of denaturation.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.210
So can anyone think of
what kinds of things

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.790
would cause protein
DNA denaturation?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.517
Yes.

00:02:34.517 --> 00:02:35.350
AUDIENCE: Some heat.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.910
PROFESSOR: Heat is a bad one,
is a serious one, obviously.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.158
And heat-- yes, I'll
write them all down.

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:42.700
What's yours?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.887
AUDIENCE: pH.

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:44.470
PROFESSOR: pH.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.080
So pH.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.700
Acidity.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.100
Basicity.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.430
And we'll talk about why
those things cause changes.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.900
Any other thoughts?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.658
Yes?

00:02:56.658 --> 00:02:58.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.250
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.750
Yeah.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.785
So for example, salt.
Organic solvents.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.480
And a process that
a lot of people

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.210
don't necessarily think about,
but as engineers some of you

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.130
will, is shear forces.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.210
So if you're shooting a protein
through a very narrow tubing

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.670
and there's high shear
forces, those who will also

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.320
denature nature proteins.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.120
So with heat, it's very clear.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.370
You're going to break
those weak bonds.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.790
And then they can either reform.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.990
Or if you go to too high
heat, the unfolded protein

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.330
starts to form aggregates.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.630
And anyone who has
ever scrambled an egg

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.240
knows that that is an
irreversible process.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.930
You don't get to cram the
egg back into the shell.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.450
It's not the same anymore.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.450
Because what you're doing
when you're scrambling

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.390
eggs is denaturing proteins
through heat treatment.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.530
So that's what heat does.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.210
It breaks the forces.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.220
The proteins stretch out
into their denatured state.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.070
And instead of refolding
to a compact structure,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.260
they just start aggregating
with each other.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.740
And that's pretty
much irreversible.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.279
pH is interesting.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.950
Why would pH break up
at low temperature?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.420
Why would pH cause changes?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.113
Yeah.

00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:27.955
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] amino
acids have a certain structure.

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:30.372
So they're either protonated
or deprotonated, then the pH,

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:31.230
that would change.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.813
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.330
So pH, perfect.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.180
So pH will change
the charge states

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.030
of many of your sight chains.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.900
And once you've
changed it, you might

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.360
have had a lovely
electrostatic interaction.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.300
But then you go and protonate
the carboxylic acid.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.480
And it can't form-- in
fact, it wants the form,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.720
it wants to break apart as
opposed to come together.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.600
So that is changing
charged state,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.180
which causes denaturation.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.890
Salts and organics.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.680
For example, they
may make interactions

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.340
with parts of the protein.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.240
For example, organics,
organic molecules

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.110
may slip into a hydrophobic
core and break them up.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.380
Just push them apart.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.510
They want to be there.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.870
And then too much of
a high concentration

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.120
of an organic solvent that
is miserable with water.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.380
And we would say ethanol,
acetonitrile, DMSO.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.030
But you don't need
to worry about too

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.350
much of which details.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.310
Well actually, once you
get above 10% or so,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.170
we'll just start denaturing
proteins, sometimes reversibly

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.420
but often irreversibly.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.460
So this is very important to
know that proteins are stable,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.650
but you've got to
treat them nicely.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.350
There are some
human diseases that

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.980
are a result of misfolded
or aggregated proteins.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.680
So for example, all
the prion diseases

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.140
are proteins gone
bad, pretty much,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.370
where they are not in a
folded structure anymore,

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.210
but they are in aggregates
that cause problems

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.510
with cellular
processes and toxicity.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.940
So Alzheimer's disease.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.050
Mad cow disease.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.200
A lot of those are
neurologic disorders

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.550
caused by poorly folded or
very misfolded proteins,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.730
for example.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.170
So these are the things
we talked about last time

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.170
with respect to the flux
from primary to secondary,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.090
to tertiary to quaternary.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.740
And that's a perfect time
for me to introduce to you

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.400
what we'll talk about today.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.140
So last time we talked
about structural proteins.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.990
And I showed you
how collagen, just

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.310
with a simple defect, changing
a glycine an alanine in one

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.560
of its subunits, really alters
the quaternary structure

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.620
of the protein to make
very weak collagen

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.380
that's no longer supportive
of bone strength.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.360
But what I'm going to
talk to you about today

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.850
is a defect in a
transport protein

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.320
that carries oxygen
around the body.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.010
So we're going to
talk about hemoglobin.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.780
These diseases
are what are known

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.860
as inborn errors of
metabolism, or that's

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.330
kind of a complex term.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.750
Or genetically linked
diseases, because there

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.500
is a single defect
in a DNA strand

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.620
that then gets transcribed
into an RNA strand.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.800
So one base defect that then
becomes an amino acid defect

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.600
in your protein strand.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.050
So these are tiny changes
in the protein that

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.500
cause dramatic changes
in the structure

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.520
and function of the protein.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.430
And what you will
see with hemoglobin

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.630
is it causes a real problem
with the quaternary structure

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.530
and causes proteins
to aggregate.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:54.620
So hemoglobin is the dominant
protein in red blood cells.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.040
Or erythrocytes.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.600
And in fact, the differentiation
of the red blood cell

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.820
as it comes from
progenitor cells

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.360
goes through a process where
the red blood cell dumps out

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.570
its nucleus so it
can't divide anymore.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.120
And basically, the
content of the cell

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.910
is extremely high in hemoglobin.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.640
You've packed the hemoglobin
into the red blood

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.590
cell at the cost of
losing the nucleus.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.740
So that's terminally
differentiated.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.720
Can't become a red blood cell.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.669
It can't divide anymore.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.620
And it has about
a half-life, they

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.230
have about a
half-life of 100 days.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.630
So they turn over,
and then that's it.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.970
And when red blood
cells turn over,

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.880
the hemoglobin has to be
taken care of in order

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.440
that it's not toxic.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.580
Red blood cells are red because
of a particular molecule

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.920
that's in the hemoglobin
called the heme molecule, which

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.810
is bound to iron, which
provides the hemoglobin

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.180
with the capacity to pick
up oxygen in your lungs,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.100
travel it around the
body, and then leave it

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.150
where it's needed.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.420
And then replace
the oxygen with CO2

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.300
and take the CO2 back
to the lungs in order

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.910
for you to respire it out.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.660
OK?

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:34.770
So hemoglobin carries
oxygen and CO2,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.030
from oxygen from the lungs,
CO2 back to the lungs.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.480
And the reason why
you need the iron

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.050
is that the iron is
coordinated to the oxygen.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.060
So the heme molecule--

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.230
I won't draw it.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.800
If you want to see it, it's a
big, complex organic structure.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.480
Very interesting structure.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.880
But something for
another day here.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.910
But I want to just stress
to you that the iron heme

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.350
complex is red.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.180
That's why your
blood cells are red.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.880
Your blood cells
don't have a nucleus

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.990
so they can cram in
lots more hemoglobin.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.510
So it's kind of a
fascinating situation.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:15.600
So hemoglobin is an example
of a homotetrameric protein.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.360
And it has four subunits.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.620
Two of one flavor
and two of another.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.800
So we call this an
alpha 2 beta 2 protein,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.390
differentiating the alpha
subunits and the beta ones.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:32.890
Yes.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.740
AUDIENCE: Why isn't
it homotetrameric?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.510
PROFESSOR: Why isn't
it homotetrameric?

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:38.482 --> 00:10:39.940
PROFESSOR: You
could ask why is it?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.700
I don't know.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.670
I mean, there will
be interactions

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.080
amongst the subunits that favor
that particular packaging.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.550
The subunits are kind
of similar in shape.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.790
They have what's
called a globin fold.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.910
You can more or less pick
out those tubes, remember,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.980
alpha helices.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.560
They could form tetramers
that are all the same,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.660
but the energetically favored
form is the two and two.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.370
Hemoglobin is a
tetrameric protein,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.660
because that's really
advantageous for picking up

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.710
oxygen and dropping off oxygen
in a very narrow oxygen range.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.710
So there are proteins
called globins

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.700
that just one of these
that can bind oxygen.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.160
Hemoglobin is tetrameric
because it has

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.180
a cooperative oxygen binding.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.770
So in a very narrow
range of oxygen,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.410
it fills all four sites
in the tetrameric protein

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.130
with an oxygen Molecule.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.080
So it's very advantageous
from a physics perspective

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.827
that it responds to
very narrow changes

00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:42.660
in oxygen. Does that
make sense to everyone?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.303
Yeah.

00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:45.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.690
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.140
It means, anything that's
cooperative means that one,

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.290
let's say I've got a
tetramer of hemoglobin.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.220
One oxygen binds to one of them.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.930
So I'm a binding oxygen here.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.330
And then binding to the
next, the next, and the next

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.960
gets easier and easier.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.800
So they sort of want
to come in as a team.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.340
And that's handy for
maximizing oxygen transport

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.120
around the body in a narrow
oxygen range, which we can only

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.050
deal with what's out
there in the atmosphere,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.990
so we have to make this work.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.460
Does that answer your question?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.190
OK.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.690
All right.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.380
So where was I?

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.790
OK.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.320
So what we're going to do today.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.210
We're going to
look at hemoglobin.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.090
It's the tetramer.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.010
Those discoid structures are
the hemes that I just mentioned.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.590
I've drawn them as this
sort of four-leafed clover

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.870
here just for simplicity.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.500
And there is a single
defect in the sequence

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.730
of the single monomer
subunits in hemoglobin.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.910
So each of these--

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.970
let's go here.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.840
So there are four
proteins-- beta globin,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.940
two copies of beta globin, and
two copies of alpha globin.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.080
They are all-- let me see.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.250
What's the size?

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.010
Do, do, do, do.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.527
[INAUDIBLE] You know,
I can never see things

00:13:12.527 --> 00:13:13.610
when I'm up at the screen.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:19.540
But they're about 150.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.640
156.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.140
OK.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:28.450
So they're about 146 amino
acids long in each of them.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.400
And a single defect
in the beta globin

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.200
where you have a change
from glutamic acid

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.550
residue 6 to valine
at residues 6--

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.370
one change in beta
globin, which means

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.050
two changes in the
whole structure,

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.600
because there are
two beta globins--

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.600
alters the properties of
the hemoglobin and causes

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.357
what's called sickling
of your red blood cells.

00:13:55.357 --> 00:13:57.190
So let's take a look
at what that would look

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.780
like at the amino acid level.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.920
Glutamic acid is one of
your charged amino acids.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.380
I'm just going to draw
a little bit of it

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.460
as it were in a peptide.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.130
And it's at position
6 in the sequence.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.210
So it's six residues
from the amino terminus

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.940
because we always write
things in this direction.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:34.420
And the change takes place
to put in place a valine.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.670
And there's a pretty big change
in identity and personality

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.020
of those residues.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.190
You've gone from polar charged,
to neutral, big, fluffy,

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.050
hydrophobic residue.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.590
And it's really amazing.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.290
So the beta globin is
expressed on chromosome 11.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.220
It's 134 million base pairs.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.720
One base has changed.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.560
So what you have in the
DNA, in the normal DNA that

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.650
encodes the normal
beta globin gene,

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.040
there's a particular
sequence of nucleic acids.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.260
This is what the double
strand would look like.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.440
We're going to see way more
about nucleic acids next week.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.490
When that gets converted
to the messenger RNA,

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.460
you get a particular code
that in the genetic code

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.170
codes for glutamate acids.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.400
Everything's normal.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.380
A single change, if we change
the center nucleic acid

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.450
within the DNA, it makes
a different messenger RNA.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.820
And one base pair puts in valine
instead of glutamic acid out

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.920
of 134 million base pairs.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.590
So what happens in
the normal hemoglobin,

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.970
you have normal behavior.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.130
You had this
tetrameric structure.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.000
It cooperatively
carries oxygen. It moves

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.710
around the blood no problem.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.560
Excuse me, it sits
in the erythrocytes

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.600
or red blood cells no problem.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.640
The minute you
have that mutation,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.310
the hemoglobin molecules
start to associate

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.280
into clusters like
fibrillar clusters,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.730
because each tetramer gets
glued to another tetramer,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.470
and another one,
and another one.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.080
So you have hemoglobin
not behaving

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.230
as this beautiful, independent
quaternary structure,

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.260
but rather sticking
to, physically

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.210
sticking to other Molecules

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.190
And those tangles
get, those molecules

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.090
get so large that
they start to form

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.820
long and inflexible chains.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.530
And it's such a dramatic change
that that discoid structure

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.970
that you're familiar
with for red blood cells

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.430
suddenly becomes a sickle shape.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.520
So that would be the normal
cell with normal hemoglobin.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.040
But sickle cell,
they look like this.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.310
They're kind of curved,
odd, a very odd shape.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.570
And the problem
is red blood cells

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.600
have evolved to
move really smoothly

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.290
through your capillaries.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.920
As soon as you get a
different shape that's

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.150
sort of not that
discoid structure,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.450
they start clogging
in the capillaries.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:15.319
And when you have the defect
where all of your hemoglobin

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.599
is messed up with
this variation,

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:21.260
it's incredibly painful, because
think of all your capillaries

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.069
going out to the farther
reaches of your joints.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:28.790
Those very thin blood
vessels are blocked up

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.180
with the sickle red blood
cells that are caused

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.550
by the variation in hemoglobin.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.240
So that one little defect
takes us all the way

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.710
to a serious disease.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.250
All right?

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.140
So what I want to
do very briefly

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.500
is show you the
molecular basis for this.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.900
All right.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.230
And the defect actually appears
on the two beta globin chains,

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.270
but right on the
outside of the protein,

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.000
not in the middle
of the protein.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.670
Because this is a defect that
affects how proteins interact

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.860
with other proteins,
not the function

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.300
of the protein on its own.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.480
Probably still carries
oxygen just fine.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.750
But it's the mechanical
change in the hemoglobin

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.360
that causes the disease.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.270
OK.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.650
So sickle cell
anemia, the hemoglobin

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.440
is now called hemoglobin
S with that mutation

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.360
that I just described.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.570
And when people
are heterozygous,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.870
it means they have one good
copy of the gene that's normal

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.910
and the copy of the
gene that's the variant.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.820
And you'll learn much more
about this in human genetics

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.870
when we talk about
that later on.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:39.440
So you have a mixture of the OK
hemoglobin and the sickle cell

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.460
hemoglobin.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.910
People who are homozygous
for the defect, all

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.900
of their hemoglobin
is disrupted,

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.730
and those are the
people who really end up

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.700
in hospital with a lot of
transfusions, and so on.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.850
The heterozygous, actually,
you can manage quite well with.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.800
And I'm going to show
you in a minute that

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.280
in some parts of the
world, being heterozygous--

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.730
i.e., having some of your
hemoglobin with a defect

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.050
and some without it--

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.610
actually confers an advantage.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.010
It's a really cool story.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.500
So what I'm going to
do is quickly show you

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.540
the wire structure.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:23.510
OK, so this is the structure
that elucidated the real reason

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.510
for the interaction.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.200
What happens when you
have this mutation.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.210
And it was a structure
that was captured

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.535
of a dimer of
hemoglobin molecules

00:19:34.535 --> 00:19:36.410
where you could really
see what was happening

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.070
at the interface and the sorts
of changes that had been put

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.890
in place by that
variation from the charged

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.490
to the neutral structure.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.790
So for any of you
who want to pop by,

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.240
I can start to show you
how to manipulate PyMOL.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.370
We can do that
separately from class.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.670
But this is a
dimer of tetramers.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:01.220
And if I just show you
just some of the subunits,

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:07.700
I can actually show
you how there's

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.100
two of each subunit
in each structure.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.400
So if I, go I can pick some out.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.380
Every other one.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.200
And then I can color
them a different color.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.710
You can see where the globins,
where the beta globin are

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.390
and where the alpha globins are.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.110
That's still looks
like chicken wire.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.000
It's very unsatisfactory.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.130
So what I can do is I can show
you everything as a cartoon

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.890
and get rid of all
those little lines.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.700
And then you can see
perfectly the structure

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.720
where you see two beta
globins and two alpha globins

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.690
in each structure.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.190
OK?

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.530
So what we're going
to do next is zoom in

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.840
to see what's
happening where we've

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.140
done this mutation, what's
going on with the placement

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.670
of the valine in that structure.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.170
All right?

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.290
And wherever I put a four-letter
code-- so that one was 2HBS--

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.200
that's what's known as the
protein data bank code,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.530
and it enables you to
go fetch the coordinates

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.470
of that protein.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.380
So if any of you
for the late project

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.510
want to do a protein structure
and print it, come to me

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.210
and I'll explain a
lot more about that.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.260
Or the TAs can also do that.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.750
So let me now move you
to looking in closely

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.800
to the variations.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.710
So what I've done here is
I've actually colored--

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.800
the beta globin is purple,
and the alpha globin

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.660
is cyan colored.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.120
You can see the hemes
in each of the subunits.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.640
Those are those red wire things.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.580
And now we've zoomed
into the place where

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.240
the mutation is where
you have a valine instead

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.160
of carboxylic acid.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.970
And what you can see from
this image which should stop

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.770
is that the valine on one
subunit in one homotetramer

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.030
interacts with a sticky patch
on another subunit that's

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.110
made up of phenylalanine
85 in the adjacent protein

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.300
and leucine 88 in
the adjacent protein.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.860
So this sticky patch
on one surface glues

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.820
onto a sticky patch on the
surface of another tetramer.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.830
If you had glutamic glutamate
there, would that form?

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.400
No.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.980
In fact, it would be quite
deterred from forming

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.430
because you don't want to cram
that negatively charged element

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.070
into those two
hydrophobic residues.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.480
So what you've gone from is
a situation where this really

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.770
is fine on the surface.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:36.610
It's hydrated.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.350
It's not sticking to anything.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:51.440
To another situation where you
have phenylalanine and leucine,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.360
which are both hydrophobic,
providing a patch on the one

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.130
tetramer where the valine from
the other tetramer combined.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.440
And because the
molecule's a tetramer,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.800
on each of the
subunits, there is also

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.310
another valine that will go
off and do that elsewhere,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.690
and another valine.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.270
And there's one you can't
see that's tucked behind.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:18.500
So that's why the hemoglobin
forms these structures,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.260
because every
hemoglobin molecule has

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.440
two places to stick to another
hemoglobin tetramer, and so on.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.420
So think of the repercussions
from one nucleic acid change

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.490
that's really quite remarkable.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.720
So what we've seen here is
that that change occurs.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.880
And just a couple of moments
for you to think about this,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.870
you can have variations
at that site that

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.160
won't cause a problem.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.200
Which ones of these
do you think are

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.140
least likely to cause a sickle
cell type of phenomenon?

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.330
So tyrosine, serine,
aspartic acid, and lysine?

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.990
So I'm going to change the
glutamate to something else.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.450
Which one's going to have a
perfectly normal hemoglobin?

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.720
There's one that stands out.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.220
Yeah.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:02.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.533
PROFESSOR: Aspartic.

00:24:03.533 --> 00:24:04.040
That's fine.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.640
No problem.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.890
It just switched it for
its younger brother.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.010
Well, which one of the others?

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.760
And in many cases here,
you could probably

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.920
argue your way to all of them.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.480
But one would be pretty bad.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.260
Which one would be pretty bad?

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.330
Tyrosine, exactly.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.060
It's another.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.650
Even though it's
got that OH group,

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.960
it's still pretty
hydrophobic because

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.480
of that ring system there.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.760
What about the other
two, serine and lysine?

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.970
What do you think?

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.080
Which one would probably be,
in fact, the least detrimental

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.860
of those remaining two?

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.120
And give me the reason as well.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.840
Yes.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.560
AUDIENCE: Lysine.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.760
PROFESSOR: Lysine.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.950
I think it would be lysine
because lysine is now

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.390
positively charged.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.070
It's equally unlikely to want
to do this goofy interaction

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.310
because it is also charged, just
charged in the other direction.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.820
But one could also argue
that serine would be OK

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.720
because it's a little
bit more polar, so it

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.820
wouldn't cause as much problem.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.680
OK.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.810
Finally, this issue
with sickle cell anemia,

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.300
there's some
fascinating data that

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.350
shows in parts of the world--

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.870
for example, during a drug trial
for plasmodium falciparum, one

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.970
of the causative
agents of malaria,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.440
they found that 1 out of 15
people with the sickle cell

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.000
trait was infected with malaria,
whereas then the people who

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.650
were healthy, normal homozygotes
for the right hemoglobin,

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:36.720
14 out of 15 were infected
with plasmodium falciparum.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.700
Now why do you think that is?

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.633
How can we relate the
infectivity of a parasite

00:25:44.633 --> 00:25:45.675
with the shape of a cell?

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.760
We've gone from these
juicy-looking red blood

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.210
cells, nice and round
and probably quite open,

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.000
to a cell that's sort
of difficult to shape.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.220
So it turns out
that the parasite

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:07.230
doesn't want to infect
the sickle cell red blood

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.630
cells anywhere near as well.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.740
And there are, for example,
other bloods tested which

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.480
shows the same correlation.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.560
And here's a map of Africa
where you see a massive overlap

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.930
of the prevalence of
the sickle cell trait

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.860
and the presence of
plasmodium falciparum.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.900
So there is an
evolutionary advantage

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.980
to having the
heterozygous variant

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.010
where you have some
normal hemoglobin but some

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.620
of the sickling hemoglobin,
because it confers

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:46.020
you some resistance to malaria.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.260
It's not good to
have both of them,

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.910
the variant that
causes sickling,

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.980
because that's
painful and it really

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.960
causes a lot of
health disorders.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.860
It's just when you have
one of each gene encoding

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.060
both variants.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.430
OK?

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.930
All right.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:03.600
Great.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.100
OK.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.590
So now we're going to
talk about enzymes.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:11.810
And these are the proteins
that catalyze reactions.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.500
Any questions about that?

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.960
So while a lot of
disease states actually

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.420
might be bred out
because someone

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.140
would be at a disadvantage
with a particular disease,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.440
in this case, that trait
has been maintained

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.905
because it offers a
very different advantage

00:27:32.905 --> 00:27:33.905
with respect to disease.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.830
OK.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.500
Let's talk about
enzymes for a moment.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500
Or for the rest of
the class, in fact.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.160
OK.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.810
So enzymes are the heavy
lifters of the protein world

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:55.280
because they catalyze all
the reactions in metabolism,

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.640
in biosynthesis, all
kinds of transformations

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.440
that make you want you are.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.630
Enzyme is a
protein-based catalyst.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.500
You all know that.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.580
Terrible writing again.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.500
There were a couple
of other times

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.630
I just quickly want to give you.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.380
So an enzyme, there is also
a term known as an isozyme.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.860
And an allozyme.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.730
You may see them.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.710
You'll see allozyme
less commonly,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.890
but you'll see isozyme
quite commonly.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.130
An isozyme of one
enzyme is a variation

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.980
on the enzyme that
catalyzes the same reaction,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.810
but it's expressed
on a different gene.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:57.150
An allozyme is the same enzyme,
but with a variation in it.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:02.060
So it's encoded by an
allele of one gene.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.540
So it's just a variation
of the gene that might have

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.250
happened through a mutation.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.030
Still catalyzes the reaction,
but there's a slight change

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.080
in the sequence.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.720
But they're coded
by the same gene.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.950
Same gene, with a variation.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:26.110
And as I said, you will see
the isozyme term more commonly

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.480
than the allozyme term.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.490
Now why do we need enzymes?

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:36.080
Well, the problem is there
are physiologic reactions

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.050
that we need to carry
out that are just

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:44.300
too hard to carry out at room
temperature pH 7 in water.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.870
They just don't occur.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:58.300
So you need enzyme
catalysis for all

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.740
of your metabolic reactions.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.410
Let me just give you
one trivial example.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:09.040
This bond you already
know nicely now.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.350
Peptide or amide bond.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.720
If I want to
hydrolyze that, if I

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:19.130
want to break it open, pH 7,
physiologic temperature, so

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:24.370
37c, in water, it
would take me--

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.270
how many years is it?

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.710
The half-life of that
bond would be 600 years.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.210
OK?

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.050
That's pretty untenable
for digesting a Big

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.260
Mac even that even under
the best of circumstances.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.150
So we need enzymes to speed
up breaking down proteins

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.550
and carrying out reactions
because otherwise,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.860
we just can't-- we
can't do anything.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.640
So what I want to
describe to you

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.510
are some of the details
of how enzymes work

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.850
and then how we can control
the function of enzymes.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:05.715
So typical enzymes take
a substrate to a product.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:14.050
Some enzymes may
take two substrates

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.130
and make one product.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.350
Some enzymes maybe
take one substrate

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.820
and make two products.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.500
It just depends on
the transformation

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.700
that you're doing.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.090
Enzymes are classified into a
bunch of different families.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.970
But the thing that will
tell you that something

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.040
you're reading
about is an enzyme

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.580
is the suffix ASE at the end
of the name of the enzyme.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.720
So the enzyme that
hydrolyzes the peptide bond

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.970
or hydrolyzes
proteins is called,

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:49.570
no big surprise, a protease.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.490
And you'll see later
on ribonuclease, DNAs,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.480
oxidoreductases, all
kinds of reactions

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.300
where if you see this term
at the end of the name

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.160
it's telling you quite loud
and clear that it's an enzyme.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.000
Just a very sort of simple
way of remembering that.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:23.610
Now enzymes promote
reactions in order

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.670
that we can have them carried
out at room temperature.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:31.080
But we want to think about how
they carry out these changes

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.430
and transformations.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.250
What is it about the
structure of the protein that

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.930
enables these reactions?

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.580
But the first
thing we have to do

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.790
is take a look at the
thermodynamics and kinetics

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.230
of a transformation.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.280
So before I go anywhere,
what I want to do

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.040
is describe to you
how enzymes work

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.010
by thinking about the
physical parameters

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.940
that we describe the
energetics of a transformation.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.080
So in thermodynamics,
you all know

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:06.660
delta G is delta
H minus T delta S.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.690
And we're really only going to
worry about one of these terms.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.880
We're going to worry about
delta G, and I'll explain why.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:17.330
So delta G is the
Gibbs free energy.

00:33:25.316 --> 00:33:33.800
H is the enthalpy T is
the temperature in Kelvin.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.380
And then S is entropy.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.760
So these are the two terms when
you're looking at an energy

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.540
diagram, we generally
think about reactions where

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:55.810
we describe the y-coordinate
as the change in delta G,

00:33:55.810 --> 00:34:01.240
the change in the free energy,
and the x-coordinate is

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.860
your reaction coordinate.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.620
So in going from a
substrate to a product,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.230
we generally have
a situation where

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.770
we have a substrate
at a certain energy,

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.797
and then maybe a product
at a different energy.

00:34:19.797 --> 00:34:21.880
And we're going to talk
about the details of that.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.980
So why do we deal with Gibbs
free energy, not enthalpy?

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.719
Does anyone know?

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:30.730
OK.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:35.710
Enthalpy describes the energies
of all the bonds in a molecule.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.449
But when you're doing
an enzyme-catalyzed

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.850
transformation, you're
not busting open

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:40.810
all of those bonds.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.820
You're not breaking something
down to carbon, hydrogen,

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.590
and oxygen. You're only dealing
with parts of the energetics

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.670
of the molecule.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.190
You're only dealing with
what's known as the free energy

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.270
changes.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.860
So looking at the
enthalpy changes

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.340
isn't going to get you very far.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.460
It's not going to
describe the reaction

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.770
because the enthalpy
changes would be enormous

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.130
breaking down that molecule.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.490
And that's not what
you want to achieve.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.780
In a chemical transformation,
we care about delta G.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.090
Now the next thing
to think about is

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.190
what are the energetics
of the reaction,

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.760
and how does an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction manipulate

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.040
those energetics?

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.460
So the key thing here
is we want to talk

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.140
about Gibbs free energy.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.880
I shouldn't have written
quite this much stuff here

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.675
because I need the Blackboard.

00:35:33.675 --> 00:35:34.820
All right.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:40.440
So when you describe
a reaction, you

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.570
want to understand how
far that reaction goes

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.570
and how fast that reaction goes.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.390
So when you go
through a reaction,

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.470
we can describe how
far the reaction goes

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.280
by thinking about the free
energy of the substrates

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.580
and the products.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.260
So in this case, the substrate
is at a higher energy

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.730
than the products.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.670
So you will go a long
way through the reaction

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.720
to make quite a lot of
products in a transformation.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.410
So that describes how
far the reaction goes.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:26.340
So that is the difference
between the energy

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.620
of the substrate
and the product.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:33.720
How fast the reaction goes is
described in a different part

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.940
of this diagram.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.430
Does anyone know what it is?

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.930
Yes.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.013
AUDIENCE: Activation rate.

00:36:39.013 --> 00:36:40.120
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.660
How fast the reaction
goes is literally

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.120
how high the
mountain is that you

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.800
have to get over to carry
out the transformation.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.120
And that height is described
as the energy of activation.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.540
So that tells you how fast,
and the difference here

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.070
tells you how far.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:04.000
The energy of activation is
a really important parameter

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.910
because it's actually what gets
manipulated when you're dealing

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.980
with catalyzed reactions.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.840
So the energy of activation--

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.320
the higher that mountain
is, the slower the reaction

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.480
will be because it's a
much harder transformation

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.710
to go through.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:22.060
The reactions in our bodies
can be of different flavors

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.850
depending on the
difference in energy

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.920
of the substrate
and the product.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.650
So shown there, substrate
going to product

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.830
where the product is at lower
energy than the substrate,

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.400
we would call this
an exergonic reaction

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.620
because we're releasing
energy in the transformation.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.855
So S higher than P. Exergonic.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.700
And if we have a
different reaction--

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.380
and I'll sketch
this one in here--

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.940
where the product
is higher energy--

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.090
and this is a
reaction coordinate--

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:16.065
then that will be an
endergonic reaction.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.780
Both reactions happen in
enzyme-catalyzed systems.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.660
And we'll explain why
you're able to catalyze

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.210
even ones that require energy.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.610
So exergonic releases energy.

00:38:44.502 --> 00:38:50.510
And endergonic requires.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.010
OK.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.510
What else have I got on here?

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.470
We also, in the situations
where energy is produced,

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:10.730
the exergonic reactions, we
call these catabolic processes.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.880
And if you have
trouble remembering

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.040
catabolic and anabolic,
just join me in

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.320
that because I always
forget which is which.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.160
But the ones that produce
energy are catabolic.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.690
The ones that require
energy are anabolic.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.180
And when we think
about metabolism,

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.480
the catabolic reactions are when
we're breaking molecules down

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.770
because we need energy.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.370
We need to use it
to do something.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.990
The anabolic reactions are
when we want to store things.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.690
Store fats, build
proteins, because they're

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.890
going to be endergonic.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.310
They're going to be requiring
energy to take place.

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.590
I just forgot one thing
that I have shamefully done.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:52.270
Remember, this axis is
kilocalories per mole

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.540
most commonly when we're
talking about delta G,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.000
or kilojoules per mole if
you're in a different part

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.570
of the world.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.270
But it's important to have
units on these diagrams.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.480
So that tells us
a little bit about

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.440
enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.500
We need the enzyme
to do something

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.900
about this energy of activation.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.390
Because if we didn't have
a high energy of activation

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.760
and I brought a Snickers
bar to eat during class,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.160
I would just burst
into flames, right?

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.830
It needs a high
energy of activation

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:28.090
to keep it stable under
regular conditions,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.870
but only break down
the bonds at times when

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.520
you require that breakdown.

00:40:37.342 --> 00:40:38.470
All right.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.420
So what did the catalyst do?

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.960
OK.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.020
Now I'll show you
the simple reaction.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.090
The enzymes are a
very large structure.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.430
It binds to a substrate,
chemistry happens,

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.350
and it releases a product.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:06.830
But at the same time, you
can't disobey the principles

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:08.010
of thermodynamics.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.160
So there are certain
criteria we have

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.330
to think about when we consider
an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:19.760
So first of all, do not disobey
whichever law of thermodynamics

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.420
it is.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:28.910
They do not change
delta G. Delta

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.340
G is a property of
the two reactants.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.100
You're not going to
change it with a catalyst.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.510
It's going to have a much
more, a more important impact

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.800
on a different parameter.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.130
Which parameter do enzymes
change and help lower?

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:44.630
Over there.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.872
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:45.872 --> 00:41:46.580
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:54.200
So catalysts do
change and in fact

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.730
lower energy of activation.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.970
And we'll talk about how
they do that the end.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.760
And then the last
rule about a catalyst

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:12.410
is you can recover them
unchanged after a reaction.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.800
It would be a lousy catalyst
if it did its chemistry

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.180
and then you've used
up the catalyst.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.290
So enzyme catalysis are the
ultimate green reagents.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.150
You can keep using
them thousands

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:25.570
and thousands of times
to continuously turnover

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:26.500
transformation.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.020
So you haven't
changed a catalyst.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.510
So the things that we want
to think about is how--

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.170
what are the processes that
enzymes can manipulate?

00:42:41.667 --> 00:42:43.250
And I should probably
just quickly run

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.228
through these slides so we've
talked about these entities.

00:42:46.228 --> 00:42:48.020
But I put them on the
board because they're

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.220
particularly important.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.750
So the energy of activation
of a catalyzed reaction

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.690
is lower than the uncatalyzed.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.130
And I'm not going to bore
you with these questions

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.230
because you can work
this out quite readily.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.250
So delta G is the free
energy that changes.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.850
And these are endergonic because
the energy of the products

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.750
is lower.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.360
So this is the slide I
want to get to with respect

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.640
to the enzyme--

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.200
to enzyme catalysis.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.270
So we always think,
well, gosh, the enzyme

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:20.240
is really large relative
to the size of the product.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.520
That's because all the energy
within the protein-folded

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.840
structure is very
useful for lowering

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.090
the energy of activation
of a transformation.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.090
So let's say I have
a reaction that

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:37.370
involves two substrates coming
together to make a product.

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.370
If I'm off the
enzyme, these guys,

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.920
it's going to take them a long
time to bump into each other

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.900
to do chemistry.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.900
The way enzymes catalyze
those types of reactions

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.800
is they have binding sites
for both of those compounds.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.230
In fact, the enzyme
acts as a stage.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:56.540
One substrate binds.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.010
The other substrate binds.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:01.070
They're binding close to
each other on the enzyme.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.660
Chemistry can happen.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.070
It favors reactions that
involve multiple molecules.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.210
What about another situation
where you have a bond--

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.700
for example, the amide bond--

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.810
the proteases break?

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.140
It's hard to think of how that--
how can we make that more easy?

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.330
Well, amides are
most stable when

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:28.820
they are flat and planar through
this arrangement of atoms.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.260
But what can happen
on the enzyme

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:34.820
is that they can twist bonds to
make them less stable and then

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.770
more easy to hydrolyze.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:39.830
So the structure of that
enzyme basically holds

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.000
onto the substrate and
twists or distorts the bond

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.250
that you're trying
to do chemistry on

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.760
to once again lower the
energy of activation.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.580
Another way enzymes work
is in a reaction where

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.740
you're breaking
this bond, you might

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.050
make charged intermediates.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.590
The enzyme's there to hold
those charged intermediates

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.420
in order to stabilize them.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.240
Once again, to lower
energy of activation.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.670
So it's funny when you get
the question that's well,

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.830
how do enzymes
catalyze reactions?

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.570
There is no one rule.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.550
You want to think
about the reactions

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:17.180
and then just think about the
ways in which an enzyme could

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.710
contribute to that.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.110
For example, orienting
two substrates

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.300
ready to do chemistry.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.990
Causing physical strain in a
bond that you want to break.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:33.380
Or comforting electric charges
that form during a reaction

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.382
coordinate.

00:45:34.382 --> 00:45:36.590
So there are loads and loads
of different principles,

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:41.090
and it's a really important
study that is carried out.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:45.020
So finally, I think
I have a couple--

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.150
oh no, I have a
couple of minutes.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.350
But I want to just
describe this to you.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.050
It'll also be covered
in the sections,

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:54.110
because I'm going to rush it
a bit because this last bit

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.810
features a little
bit on the P set.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:02.300
So finally, enzymes are very
commonly the targets of drugs.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.780
We like to think that some
drugs are important targets.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.200
If we deactivate the
enzyme, we might mitigate

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.060
the symptoms of a disease.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.580
Now you can't go in
and heat the enzyme

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.790
or denature the enzyme if
you're trying to treat a person.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.170
So we do a lot of work
to mitigate disease

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.510
by inhibiting enzymes
with small molecules.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.690
So in these slides,
I describe to you

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.830
the types of molecules that
may alter the chemistry

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.610
of a transformation.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.090
So if a substrate binds
to an enzyme-active side--

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.180
we often do this
Pac-Man rendition--

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.390
you could design a molecule
that binds there instead

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:45.210
and basically inhibits the
substrate from getting there.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:50.420
This would be called a simple
reversible inhibitor that's

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.090
competitive with
the active site.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.570
There are other inhibitors
that will bind to the enzyme

00:46:56.570 --> 00:47:00.950
but do chemistry with it and
stay blocked at the enzyme.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.190
And that would be called
an irreversible competitive

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.970
inhibitor.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.950
You can't get the inhibitor off.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.730
And there's differences in
the way you can reverse this.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.890
Because for example, up here,
if I add a lot more substrate

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.470
and these are equilibria,
I can get my reaction

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.850
to happen any way.

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:20.270
But here, I could add as
much substrate as possible

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.200
but it won't help.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.480
It won't reverse
the transformation.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.080
OK?

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.642
And there's a question here
to restore the reaction.

00:47:26.642 --> 00:47:28.100
The answer really
is, you just have

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.070
to start with a new enzyme
cause you covalently

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:33.470
changed the protein structure.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:35.435
The last type of inhibitors
that are important

00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:38.630
are the ones that bind at
different sites on the enzymes.

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:40.740
And they are called allosteric.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.630
Allo always means different.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:45.930
So if you have a compound
that's an allosteric inhibitor,

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.540
it might bind on another
face of the enzyme,

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.450
but it will alter the active
side so it doesn't work.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.550
That's an allosteric inhibitor.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:57.720
And the final type of compound
is an allosteric activator

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.180
that may bind somewhere
else on the enzyme

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.100
but make it more active.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.490
So these are the way
small molecules work.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.470
I'd like to encourage
the TAs to just cover

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:10.380
this in a little bit more
detail because I've rushed It.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.330
And I'll also re-mention
it at the beginning

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.570
of the next class.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.710
But bear in mind, we should
have everything covered now

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.830
so the problem set 1.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.600
And if you have any
questions, reach out to us.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.070
Covered them in section.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.670
And I'll reiterate a little
bit of this in the next class.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.330
And finally, there's a
little bit of reading.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.280
If you would like
to prepare, we'll

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.890
talk about
carbohydrates next time,

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.790
one of my favorite molecules.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:41.585
And there's also a fabulous set
of videos on how enzymes work

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:45.180
at the Protein Data Bank site.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.210
And you will see
this little handout

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.770
on the version of the
slides that's posted.

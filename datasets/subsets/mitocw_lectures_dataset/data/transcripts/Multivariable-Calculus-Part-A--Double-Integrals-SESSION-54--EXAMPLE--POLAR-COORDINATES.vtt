CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.390
In this video I want to show how
we can use change of variables,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.230
to polar coordinates
in particular,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.620
to evaluate an integral
that, without the change

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.770
in variables, we don't
have the techniques to do.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.490
So I'm going to show us how
to evaluate the integral from

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.210
minus infinity to infinity of
e to the minus x squared dx.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.110
And I'll just point out that if
you do anything in probability

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.520
you will see this
integral a great deal.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.179
So this is a
distribution and you'll

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.970
see it a great deal if
you ever do anything

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.540
in probability theory.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.450
But how are we going to
use polar coordinates

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.380
to evaluate this?

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.960
Well, the object is going to be
to introduce a little bit more

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.484
into this integral, so
that when I actually

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.150
introduce that in I'm
going to have an r

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.890
squared term in the exponent and
I'm going to have-- of course

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.650
by the change of variables in
the Jacobian-- multiplied by r.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.340
And that's what's
going to save us.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.980
So let me actually
just get right to it.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.310
I'm going to call this
integral, this quantity,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.164
capital I. We'll just call
this quantity capital I.

00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:14.830
And then what I'm going to do is
introduce a couple more things.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.020
So let me write it
down, and then I

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.050
will justify that it's
reasonable to even look

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.885
at this thing.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:22.635
And that it will give
us something useful.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.570
OK, so I just took this
integral and what I've done

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.970
is I've now taken this quantity
and I've multiplied by an e

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.140
to the minus y squared.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.590
And then I'm now integrating
from minus infinity

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380
to infinity in dy also.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.920
And what I want to point out,
that maybe isn't immediately

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.900
obvious from the way
it's written here,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.450
but will be immediately
obvious when

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.830
I write it a different way, is
that this quantity is actually

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.310
just the square
of this quantity.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.210
So it's actually just two of
these multiplied together.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.150
And let me point
out why that is.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.840
Because this term right here can
be rewritten as e to the minus

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.910
x squared, e to the
minus y squared.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.040
And then I have two integrals,
which are from minus

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.300
infinity to infinity both.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.975
Sorry, that one looks
a little off kilter.

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:20.270
But those two integrals,
which the bounds are minus

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.040
infinity to infinity for both.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.950
And then I have a dx and a dy.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.930
Now the reason that it is just I
squared-- this quantity is just

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.510
I squared-- is
because if you notice,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.580
this first integral, the
inside integral, this

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.850
is independent of x.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.670
So I can move it out.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.109
So let me actually come up
here and write that down.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.650
So I can move it out and I can
actually rewrite the integral.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.820
And I'll put the bounds
here, because it's high

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.970
up enough that I can
actually write it.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.530
e to the minus y squared.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.560
And then integral from
minus infinity to infinity

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.950
e to the minus x squared dx dy.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.640
Right?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.860
So let's point out
again what I did.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.900
This quantity I circled
was the constant when

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.680
I considered x the variable.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.180
Right?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.680
In terms of x, this
is the constant,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.210
so I can move it in front
of that integral, which

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.840
is the dx integral.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.280
And so now what do I see?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.010
Well, this quantity
is what I've called I.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.480
And so now that's a constant.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.660
So I can move that
out to the front.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.750
That's a constant.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.329
That's I, as designated.

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.870
And so now I have the integral
for minus infinity to infinity

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.560
of e to the minus y squared dy.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.940
And then that again is another
I. Because if you notice,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.990
I mean, this was e to
the minus x squared dx,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.510
and so if I keep this as e
to the minus y squared dy,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.870
it's going to be
exactly the same value.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.560
So this is actually
equal to I squared.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.120
So the point I want to make,
if you come back over here

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.670
to this integral, is
that this quantity I'm

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.430
going to be able to
integrate very easily.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.740
And when I do that, if
I take the square root,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.194
I'm going to get this value.

00:04:03.194 --> 00:04:05.610
Because I just showed this
thing in the box was equal to I

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.410
squared.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.140
So let me write it down.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.142
On this last part of the board
I will write down that thing

00:04:13.142 --> 00:04:14.850
again and then we'll
actually evaluate it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.592
and we'll see what we get.

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:18.511
So let me rewrite.

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.094
This is the thing
we want to evaluate.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.610
And I'm going to remind myself
that that's equal to I squared.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.549
I squared is equal
to this quantity.

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:38.340
And I mentioned at the
beginning that we're

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.215
going to use a trick.

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:42.240
We're going to change variables
into polar coordinates.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.410
And so notice that the
region we're integrating over

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.700
is the entire xy-plane.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.220
And in polar coordinates,
what's that going to be?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.240
Theta is going to run from 0
all the way around to 2 pi,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.160
and r is going to run
from 0 to infinity.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.660
And so those will be our
bounds for r and theta.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.890
Because if you want to
get the entire xy-plane,

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.750
in terms of r and theta,
that is what you have to do.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.020
And I want to
mention also, what is

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.220
this quantity going to become
in terms of r and theta?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.360
Well, notice that this
is e to the minus x

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.510
squared minus y squared.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.570
It's just really e
to the minus quantity

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.030
x squared plus y squared.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330
It's really e to
the minus r squared.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.350
So what we get when we
do a change of variables,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.820
is we do-- I'll put
the theta on the inside

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.300
actually, because that'll
be easy to do first.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.910
So the r is going to
be on the outside.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.100
The theta is going
to be on the inside.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.212
And then e to the
minus r squared,

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:41.420
that's a direct substitution.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.220
x squared plus y squared
equals r squared.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.330
And then I get r d theta dr.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.450
And this comes from the
Jacobian that you computed--

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.980
I believe in lecture
even-- to show

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.370
how you change
from x, y variables

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.660
to r, theta variables.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.880
And I put the d theta
first here because I wanted

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.259
to integrate in theta first.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.050
And the reason I want
to integrate in theta

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.610
first is notice that-- because
nothing here depends on theta--

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.019
all I pick up is a 2 pi.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:10.060
I just pick up-- when I
integrate, I get a theta.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.270
I evaluate it at 2 pi, and
then I evaluate it at 0

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.740
and I take the difference.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.349
And so if I do that line
all I get is-- well,

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.890
I should probably
write it in front--

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.650
all I get is 2 pi from
the theta, and then

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.580
the integral from
0 to infinity, e

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.590
to the minus r
squared times r dr.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.750
Now this is a much
easier quantity

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.790
to evaluate than e to
the minus x squared dx.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.660
Because now we have an r here.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.810
So now it's a natural
substitution type of problem.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.110
And we can do it right away.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.630
I'm going to write
it down and then

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.760
we'll check and make sure
I didn't make a mistake.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.460
We should get something like e
to the minus r squared over 2

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.352
with a negative sign in front.

00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:55.810
So let me make sure when I take
this derivative-- you could

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.790
just do a substitution
to check, but you should

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.480
get exactly this kind of thing.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.810
When I take the derivative
of e to the minus r squared,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.750
I get a negative 2r and then--
did I do something wrong here?

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.790
Oh yeah.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.310
I'm good.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.780
I get a negative 2r.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.400
And so the negatives kill
off, the 2s divide out,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.880
and I get my e to the
minus r squared times r.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.040
So that's good.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.290
And now I have to
evaluate it at the bounds.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.680
So again, this was
much easier to evaluate

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.900
if I do a substitution
and I let r--

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.920
I think I want to let r squared
equal u or something like this.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.670
I don't even know.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.590
I just did the substitution
without thinking about it.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.673
So you can figure out what
you need to substitute.

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:40.050
But this is what you get.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.180
And so let me actually
just evaluate at the bounds

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.380
and see what happens.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.060
So as r goes to infinity, I
get e to the minus r squared.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.200
As r goes to infinity, e to
the minus r squared goes to 0.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.000
And so the first term
is 0 when I evaluate.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.510
And then so the
second term I get

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.530
is, I do 0 minus 2 pi times--
if I evaluate at e to the 0

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:07.350
I get 1-- so I get
negative 1 over 2.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.370
The negative 1 comes
from e to the 0.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.490
And then I divide by
2 so I get my 2 there.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.200
So a negative and a negative
gives me a positive.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.380
2 divided by 2.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.660
And so the whole
thing equals pi.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.160
Whew!

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.350
Just enough room.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.010
And so I just want to remind
us where we came from.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:29.242
We came from pi-- we wanted to
show was equal-- well, the pi,

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.200
where did it come from?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.380
It's equal, if we go all the
way back up, to I squared.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.310
And so we wanted to show
what I was equal to.

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.620
I then is equal to just
the square root of pi.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.230
So I can come back over to where
I started, which is over here.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.270
And I can say this is equal
to the square root of pi.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.080
And again, I just want to
mention what it came down to.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.870
It came down to introducing
a little bit more.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.580
Essentially we
took something that

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.960
was a single variable
problem, we made it

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.720
a multivariable problem.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.930
But what that
allowed us to do is

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.770
to do a change of
coordinates from x, y

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.730
into the polar
coordinate system.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.980
And the trick here-- as you
come through-- the trick

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.760
where it actually
happens is right here.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.750
Is because this is easy to
integrate now that I have an r

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.870
here.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.940
If I didn't have--
my problem initially

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.150
was I didn't have an
x when I was trying

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.234
to find an antiderivative.

00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:23.816
But when I do the
change of variables,

00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:25.250
I get an e to the
minus r squared.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.280
And then with an r
here, that's much easier

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.470
to find an antiderivative.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.380
OK.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.250
So I think that is
where I'll stop.

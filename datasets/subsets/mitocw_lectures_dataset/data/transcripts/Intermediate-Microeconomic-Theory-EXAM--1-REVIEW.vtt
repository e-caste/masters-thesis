00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So today
is a review session.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But let me start by looking
at the class schedule.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
And today is the review session.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
readings for today.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Note the lectures are
numbered seven, eight,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:90%
so today doesn't count somehow.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But it does show up
on the class schedule.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:84%
It does not show up as a
numbered lecture on the reading

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:90%
list.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I find these, going over
randomly selected questions

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
on the study guide,
to be very helpful.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Taking a bit of time to go over,
as we usually do, in this case

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
after the end of lecture seven,
is definitely worthwhile.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So this question was
already asked of me.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So granted, it's kind of a hard
question to write and maybe

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:90%
not so obvious how to answer.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the medieval
village economy

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and think about how
you would model it

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:90%
in general equilibrium terms.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Volunteer.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
How do we model the
medieval village economy

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:90%
in general equilibrium terms?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's ready to answer this
but we already talked about it.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, who's speaking?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I was going
to say that it includes

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
the possible consumption set,
and the production vectors that

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
are possible, and the
endowment for that economy.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
And the preferences.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Yeah, and that.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, so that's good.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So then what aspects
of the medieval economy

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
do you remember
from figures and so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.475 align:middle line:84%
on that look like
one of those things?

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:90%
What about production?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, either this question
is too hard or too easy.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure which.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So one answer I didn't
give, the key just now,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is we actually thought
about the medieval village

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
when we did the dynamics
of storage, and starvation,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote down a
production technology

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:90%
mapping inputs and outputs.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So we were doing production,
and we took a stand on utility.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that was an example of
a medieval village economy,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.905 align:middle line:84%
except there was only
one person in it.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:52.405 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:02:52.405 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
those pictures,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
we have a map with
a given person

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
having its plots spread out all
over the map of the village.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So do you think they have the
same production technologies

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
or different production
technologies?

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.627 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can answer.

00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:30.085 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
discussion period.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it were the same
production technology,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
then why on Earth would they
be spreading their land out

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
over the village
into different spots?

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So it seems likely they're
different production

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.888 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
In what way do you think
they might be different?

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.132 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call on someone.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:90%
This isn't working.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Ewan, can you try
to answer that--

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
in what reasonable
way do you think

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
the production
technology is different

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.135 align:middle line:90%
across different plots?

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Maybe the
multiplier that

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
determines the state of
the world is independent,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.913 align:middle line:84%
or there are fewer correlations
the further out you go.

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, good.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So what in the
storage economy was

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that epsilon might have
different realizations

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
for different plots,
and then we get

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
into all that stuff about
correlations, and covariances,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So as I was saying, the
key at the beginning, this

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:90%
is kind of a difficult question.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why she asked me at
right when we logged on at 2:30.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult-- why?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you're so
used to seeing me

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
show you slides of things,
like here's the model,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and then you're,
like, OK, I guess

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:90%
I better learn this model.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just put you in the
different position of asking

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:90%
you to choose the model.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
That is a very interesting
skill and it is not something

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:90%
you get to practice very often.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think this
question is hard in the sense

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
used to doing that.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's the way economists
have to think about things.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:90%
We make decisions.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not like God is giving
us preferences, endowments,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of making it up,
hopefully for good reason.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's why I
earmarked that question today.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:84%
For the set of feasible
allocations in an Edgeworth box

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
economy, which allocations are
Pareto optimal and which not?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.975 align:middle line:84%
And if we had the whiteboard,
I would ask you to draw it,

00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to
be that ambitious.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So can someone just
tell me in words?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%
How about Paolo.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.507 align:middle line:90%
Can you take a stab at this.

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Yeah, sure.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So the set of all Pareto optimal
allocations inside of the box

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
are the set of points for
which the indifference

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
curves for person one and person
two are tangent to each other

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:90%
because then you can optimize.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
There's no lens-shaped
region for you

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:90%
to do something that's better.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And everything else is just
like a non-Pareto optimal

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:90%
allocation.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.415 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, that's
great, excellent answer.

00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.855 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if we get that
far in our review session,

00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
all the way back here
to lecture seven,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
we can take a look at
some of those pictures.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship
between maximized linear welfare

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
functions and Pareto optimality?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So whenever we maximize
a linear welfare function,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the resulting
allocation is guaranteed

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
to be Pareto optimal.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think conversely, any
Pareto-optimal allocation

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.772 align:middle line:84%
optimizes some linear
social welfare function.

00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:30.105 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Perfect answer.

00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm a happy camper.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You guys do really well on
these more precisely worded

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good answer.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.525 align:middle line:84%
And let's see-- that's
probably enough of that.

00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to scroll
through these lectures

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%
with two goals in mind.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
One, as I go through the slides,
sometimes pretty quickly,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
please let me know if
you have a question.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Even if you didn't
plan to ask it,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.957 align:middle line:90%
you might think of something.

00:08:08.957 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It might come back to you when
you're looking at the material.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I will try to
summarize a bit in key spots

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and draw some connections of
one lecture to another one.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:90%
So that's the plan.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The substance of
this first lecture

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
had to do with economics as
a science of experiments.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And I covered these
four different authors.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Let me just not dwell on it.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The point was economics
as an experiment,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of physics and
combining various disciplines

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And Koopmans is
making this point

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that it's much more
than just measurement.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And constantly in the
course, I am showing you

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
measurements of things, facts,
and statistics, and so on.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But like Koopmans,
that's not enough.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
We want to have a good sense
of the context of the problem

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
or economy, but we want to
go on and understand behavior

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and then make predictions.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I guess the best
illustration of our

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
doing this so far might be
the medieval storage problem,

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:84%
where we wrote that we took
the medieval village we were

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
discussing earlier, talked
about preferences, endowments,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
We did some calibration
to put in serious numbers

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
representing risk, and
returns, and so on.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we
simulated the economy

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much got
it to match the data.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So that was, I guess, the
most full-blown application

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
we've done so far in this
tradition of Koopmans,

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:84%
although Koopmans goes on to
talk about what he thinks is

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
the real goal, which is policy.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And we did not do any
policy simulations in that.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
We didn't change
something and ask

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
if we could remedy the
problem, for example.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But we will be doing much more
of that as the class goes on.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Matzkin has this language
about exogenous and endogenous

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
variables.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And we've, again in that
medieval village economy,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I think I was using
that terminology--

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
things that are taken
as given versus things

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:90%
we want to explain.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Angrist was talking about
randomized controlled trials

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and comparing them to
quasi-natural experiments.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
This first example was
paying bicycle messengers

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:90%
a higher wage.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
comments on that--

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
when we get to utility functions
and utility maximization

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
subject to budgets, we
actually had a picture

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:84%
of someone choosing how
much labor to supply

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:90%
as a function of the wage.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So this should not
be abstract anymore.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
did look at an RCT

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
in China that had
to do with changing

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
the price of a staple commodity,
which was featured in problem

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
set one.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So what am I doing?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
What on Earth am
I doing right now?

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to give
this lecture again.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to tell you that
we're delivering on it.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned these concepts
in the very first lecture,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
was probably quite abstract.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But now we're already
beginning to be

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:84%
able to fill in with the
material that came afterwards.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think this is
more issues of modeling.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Lucas artificial
economies-- I'll

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
go back to that
dynamic lecture where

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I said they could be
feeding grain to the animals

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:90%
or turning it into beer.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said we would ignore that.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
That represented a
choice so that we

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
could focus on what
arguably were the two

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:90%
most important storage devices.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So we constructed an
artificial economy

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:90%
to compare to the real data.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:90%
And Lucas mentioned computation.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
through these lectures

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that I have not shied
away from telling you

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
how to determine solutions.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
We did this with
Lagrangian stuff,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
with a set of
first-order conditions

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
you could use to help predict
and understand the solution.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
to linear programs.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
We went to dynamic programs.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do more
as we go along,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
depending on what we need to
do, depending on the lecture.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And then this list
of economies--

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
we had a great discussion
about this on the last slide

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:90%
of the dynamic problem.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
We shifted gears, and went
to a modern US economy

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
with some credit instruments.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'll come back to that.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But this first economy, the
medieval village economy,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
you've obviously seen depicted
in about three different

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:90%
lectures so far.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The Thai village
economy has entered

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
into the discussion,
economies where they didn't

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
try to diversify
ex ante, and they

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
need to potentially
to share risk ex post.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't done
much with trade yet,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
although we haven't touched
these other two yet.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
The Lucas trees we did
in that dynamic lecture

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
because we talked about yield
to seed ratios, how much harvest

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
they're getting per unit
of land planted in seed.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned again,
at the end of that lecture,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to a dynamic problem in a
different economy, where

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
they had an asset that was
like a borrowing or lending

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:90%
contract with its own return.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So we went from farming
to financial assets.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:90%
So hopefully, that's an example.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:90%
This we just did--

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:90%
what's an economy?

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Preferences, endowments,
and technology.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
We've now got examples of it and
we developed notation for it.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And throughout, I keep
trying to emphasize

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
this can be applied to economies
with dynamics with geography

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:90%
and with uncertainty.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you're getting
bored with my comments,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of yeah,
yeah, yeah, we know.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I hope you do know,
but my experience

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
has been these things
bear repeating.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:84%
We did that in the first
lecture, then we did it .

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And now we're coming
back to what did we do.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:90%
So it is a review, after all.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Lecture two was about
consumer choice.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And we reviewed what's
an economy-- preference,

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:90%
endowments, and technology--

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
as if to say now we're going
to focus only on preferences.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Motivationally, I'm very nervous
about this part of the course

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and also the same
slide for production,

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
because then we kind of forget
the whole general economy

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
thing, which is the prize
that we want to get to.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But we can't get
to the big picture

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
with all the
ingredients combined

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:90%
until we understand the pieces.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So this piece was
about the consumer.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And we applied it, though we
did try to not just make things

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:90%
to memorize or theory.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
We tried to apply it at
the end of this lecture

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and in the following two--

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
maximization of utility
subject to budgets.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So we described the consumption
set, various special versions

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:90%
that have time and geography.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And we've talked about this.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, one of the
great, little questions

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:84%
we had at the beginning
of the following class.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
consumer preferences,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
rank-ordering goods,
defined rational choice

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
as preferences which are
complete, transitive,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and continuous.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we talked
about a utility function

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:90%
representing preferences.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
A couple of things
came up here--

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
it was ordinal and not cardinal,
and we talked about that.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But we will and did need
cardinal representations

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
when we got to uncertainty
and dynamic decision problems.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Second thing is this
was a chat on Piazza.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
This slide goes from having
a continuous utility.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Any preference that
can be represented

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:84%
by a continuous
utility function is

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
rational in the sense
of the definition

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:90%
of the previous slide.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And then someone initiated
the obvious question,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
does it also go the other way--
that any rational preference

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
function can be represented
as a continuous utility?

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was,
yes, although there

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
was a good discussion about
distinguishing continuity

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
on the one hand from the
other two ingredients--

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:90%
completeness and transitivity.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So that was a great
discussion on Piazza.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Local nonsatiation--
this is kind

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
of a definition of being
close by and getting better.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:90%
I talked about no bliss points.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I think in words, we talked
about utility functions

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
with bliss points, but we
never put any pictures in.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You might be thinking,
could I draw a picture

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:84%
with a bliss point, and
what would it look like?

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:90%
More is preferred to less.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Largely I'm scrolling through
this, and hopefully quickly,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
just to make sure if you
have questions or not.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Indifference curves, the whole
family of indifference curves.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Indifferent serves can't
cross because then they

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be transitive.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Margin rates of substitution
were defined, typically

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
diminishing, although
not necessarily.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
And various displays of into
families of indifference

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
for different utility
functions, running all the way

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
from perfect substitutes
to perfect complements.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:84%
This one over here, the
right-angled indifference

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:84%
curves, represent
Leontiefian preferences

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
where there's no
substitutability.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.893 align:middle line:84%
We're about to get to maximizing
utility subject to budgets.

00:17:34.893 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
You might play
around a little bit

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens with
these particular preferences

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
when you do that.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you change prices?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
That would be an
interesting experiment

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to conduct because you'll get
really sharp predictions that

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
are distinct from what
you would get in this more

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:90%
typical smooth case.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm anticipating reviewing
the production lecture

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:90%
in two lectures away.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're able to go
back and forth between what

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
do indifference curves
look like and consumption

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
versus isoquants or isoproduct
lines in production.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
This one, the Leontief thing,
we didn't talk about it much

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in consumer theory but we did
talk about it in production,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and you probably didn't
make the connection.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'll try to remember to
point out where we actually

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
used it in production.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:84%
These are examples of utility
functions and definitions

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of convexity and
quasi-concavity.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
different concepts here.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
They were all illustrated
as holding or not

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:84%
holding, depending on how
we draw these pictures.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Convexity turns out
to be important,

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
especially when we're
drawing pictures

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:90%
of tangencies and optimization.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Things can really
go kind of crazy

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:90%
when you don't have convexity.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's convexity of the
weak upper contour set of it,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:90%
weakly preferred bundles.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
A little more technical
derivation of the marginal rate

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of substitution, and something
about homothetic preferences,

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:84%
where the slope of the
indifference curves

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:84%
are determined entirely by
the ratio of the two goods.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:84%
We kept coming back to this
picture in different ways.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:84%
In the next lecture
in fact, there's

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
something about angles
curves, and necessities,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and Giffen goods, and so on.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Suffice it to say
that if you're moving

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:90%
outwards along this ray--

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
because maybe your income
is increased, holding prices

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:84%
constant-- the goods x1 and x2
are increasing proportionally

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
with the distance
along this ray.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, since
prices are fixed,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
expenditure is also moving
proportionally along this ray.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
The preferences
were not homothetic.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Then this would not be
a line from the origin.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It would start to bend.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
was what was going

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
on when we talked about income
effects and substitution

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
That's coming up in
the next lecture.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We haven't used this
utility function very much,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:90%
although it will appear soon.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And we did talk about
utility functions

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
which are completely linear.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So finally, we get to the
utility maximization problem--

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
max utility is
subject to a budget--

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and defined homogeneity in
this consumer theory context,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and started to generate these
pictures of income budget

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
lines, and the set of
all possible purchases

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
in and under the budget line,
and the utility-maximizing

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
positions.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Although again, this is kind
of the classic smooth diagram

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes is the
only diagram you see.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm bending over
backwards to show you

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:84%
different pictures like this
one, where the maximum is not

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:90%
interior.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:84%
You do want to keep an eye out
about whether they would be

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
happy with this quantity of y,
or whether they would actually

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
like to go negative
and just cannot do it

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:90%
because of the consumption set.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And we formalize
that as an example

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of the use of the
Lagrangian, where

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
you write out this expression
with all the constraints.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is the generalized
routine for optimization,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and actually applying
it to the case

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
where we have these
non-negativity constraints

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:90%
on the two goods.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the most general way
to deal with the problem.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean all these
constraints to are binding.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
They may be binding
and may be not.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Typically with non-satiation, a
household with this constraint

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:84%
will want to spend
all its income,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
so that's usually
binding, although you

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
could try to draw a
picture where it's not.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Back, by the way,
to the bliss point,

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:90%
but I've never shown you that.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And just because it says
"greater than or equal to,"

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
non-negative, doesn't

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
mean they would want
it to go negative.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
That depends on what
this picture looks like.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we did the
example utility functions.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
This is Cobb-Douglas.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And you do the algebra,
and you get this result

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that pX times X is
total expenditures on X.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a constant,
alpha times income.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of
budget shares being constant.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
As income vary, X
and Y will vary.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
The amount spent
will vary, but it's

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:90%
going to vary in a linear way.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.535 align:middle line:90%
It's one-to-one with income.

00:22:34.535 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And that Cobb-Douglas,
this guy here,

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:90%
that's homothetic preferences.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I said that
when I was lecturing on this.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I did.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, you can
almost see it in the algebra--

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
the marginal rate of
substitution, which is here,

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
depends only on the ratio of
Y to X because this alpha is

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
a constant.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is a homothetic
utility function.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we got
to labor supply,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
which is like an
application, since I

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
was worried that you'll
lose the context of what

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to do.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So we had this picture, this
beautiful picture, of someone

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:90%
starting with leisure.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time I think
we talked about an endowment.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So they're endowed with 24
hours a day or less sleep time.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
sleep eight hours,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:90%
but now we're down to 16.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can take that time
and enjoy it in leisure

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
or run it to 0 and work.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
This diagram is in the space
of goods that consumers want.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
end up consuming

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:84%
positive amounts of
leisure, positive amounts

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
of consumption, like
x1, x2, with both

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:90%
of them being positive.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The slope of the budget
line represents the wage.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
You might play
around a bit and ask

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
if you could draw the picture
where the choice is not

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
over leisure but
labor, in which case

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
you'd be moving
to the left here.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd have to
draw the budget line--

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:90%
it's going to look similar--

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.505 align:middle line:90%
and then draw preferences.

00:24:18.505 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you what
I have in mind

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
when we get back to that
Robinson Crusoe economy.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to lecture three.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to spend a little
bit less time on this

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:84%
in terms of going through
each and every slide,

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
but try to focus more on
some of the key aspects.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:90%
So we had this demand system.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.757 align:middle line:84%
This would represent
data, but we're

00:24:39.757 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
going to assume right
away it's coming

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:90%
from utility maximization.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can think about
this as restrictions

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
on data implied by
utility maximization.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
This is in the spirit
of Frisch and RCTs

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and various other things.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:90%
So we're increasing income.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the linear
expansion path.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
to look like that.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:90%
It could look like this.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So this actually
has a negative slope

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.140 align:middle line:84%
as you increase income because
the amount purchased of goods

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.730 align:middle line:90%
is going down.

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It could be entirely
vertical, actually.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I think you could imagine
how to draw it that way.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
That utility function
I said we didn't

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
do much, which was transferable
utility, x1 plus log

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
x2, that would give you a
vertical line like this,

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:90%
or horizontal.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
which good was which,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:84%
but now the quantities
are going down or up

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and the prices are constant.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Because all we're
doing is moving income.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the
expenditure shares are

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:84%
moving in this diagram,
not just the quantities,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.980 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature
of the experiment.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So we defined inferior goods and
normal goods, and got to Engel.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Engel's law being,
in particular,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.780 align:middle line:84%
proportion of total
expenditure on food

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:90%
goes down as income goes up.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:90%
So someone asks me--

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in the Piazza
chat or was it in class--

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:90%
no, it was in class.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:84%
One of you asked
me, are we talking

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
about quantities or
shares of expenses?

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of related.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
In order for Engel's
things to be true,

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:84%
some good must be, by
definition, a necessity.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But necessities were
defined by this diagram

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:84%
where we just changed income
and didn't change prices.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to tie these
loose ends together.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we showed you what's
going on in the US.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:84%
One of you made a great
comment about this diagram,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of being tautological.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And my answer was
yes, but it's also

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:90%
quantifying the differences.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And here we did the income
and substitution effects

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
from price changes, in
particular emphasizing

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
the income effect of price
changes for increases

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and decreases in prices, and
plotted out the demand curves.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people just start with
demand curves, like this.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
So where did it come from?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
In particular with
aggregate demand,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
is it down-sloping like this?

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
happen in the economy

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
as a function of the virus has
to do with these elasticities

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer not to start
with this as a primitive.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to derive it and
put restrictions on it

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
from these underlying
first principles.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Then we defined
Giffen's paradox--

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:90%
that in the famine, the Irish--

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
which destroyed the potatoes,
they were eating more potatoes.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.690 align:middle line:84%
We decided that couldn't
literally be factually true,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and that Giffen's thing, I
thought, had never been tested.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
Jensen and Miller,

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:90%
and they shared their data.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the paper
was published and so on.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So this was an important part
of the course for two reasons.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to bring the
concepts of Giffen goods,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and hence the distinction
between income and substitution

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:90%
effects, to life in real data.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It was also, as I said earlier,
an example of an actual RCT

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:90%
in practice.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just as if we
were running an experiment.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:90%
They ran the experiment.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:90%
They actually did it.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
They had households
that were treated,

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
households that were
control, looked at behavior,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and they did find Giffen goods.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's an important part
to bring the theory to life.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is it was a
big part of problem set one.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And that came with the
experience of reading

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:84%
a professional paper,
having the data there ready

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.180 align:middle line:84%
for you to manipulate,
run some code

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to replicate what these
guys did, and to extend it.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And many of you answered
those questions.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of you did not or
didn't answer all of it.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
At a minimum for now,
you should understand

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
what it was that these guys
did, and why they did it,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and what they found, quite apart
from answering that problem.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So uncompensated and
compensated demand,

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:84%
also known as Hicksian
versus Marshallian demand.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:90%
This eliminates income effects.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So you move along indifference
curves when you change prices,

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
so it's all driven
by assumptions

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
about the marginal
rate of substitution.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We tended to draw these
smooth indifference curves

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
with declining marginal rates
of substitution, which is

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.610 align:middle line:90%
the right way to get started.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But this concept should
work as well when you have

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:90%
linear indifference curves.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So that links back to that other
diagram that I was mentioning,

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
the one with the almost-linear
indifference curve

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:90%
and the price.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, we'd be
doing that and also changing

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:90%
the price ratio.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have compensated
and uncompensated demand,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:90%
leading to Slutsky's equation.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
I helped or hurt,

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:84%
but I actually jumped ahead
to lecture 18 or something,

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and showed you eventually
how we're going to use that.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But I also told you
to ignore that detour

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:90%
if it was confusing.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But this whole lecture is
about making predictions

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
as prices change
or income change.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And this Slutsky
equation turns out

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to be something you
can measure in data.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Even though we never see
the compensated demand,

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the compensated
demand has properties

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.970 align:middle line:84%
because the expenditure
function is concave.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually put
some sign restrictions

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:84%
on the Marshallian
demand in this way.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It's all a bit surprising,
but more on that later.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's about
making predictions.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we did duality,
which I was just

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
alluding to, minimizing
expenditures subject to--

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:90%
here's the picture.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So this was the
first time we talked

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.330 align:middle line:84%
about maximizing utilities
subject to budgets, hand

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
in hand with minimizing
expenditures to achieve

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:90%
a certain level of utility.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So we defined a dual
problem relative

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to the primary problem, and got
some useful characteristics out

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:90%
of the dual.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Although in fact, if
it's a very teeny,

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:84%
weeny change, and it's all
local, nothing happens.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:90%
They're equivalent.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:84%
At least, they're equivalent
with these other underlying

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
assumptions--

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:84%
nice, smooth indifference
curves, no bliss points,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You could experiment with
putting in local satiation.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you will
discover that these things

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:90%
don't have to be the same.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Maximizing utility
subject to a budget

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and minimizing
expenditure to achieve

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:84%
a certain level of
utility will not

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.730 align:middle line:84%
be the same when you
violate the assumption

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:90%
of local non-satiation.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we developed
all this in the math,

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in the end of this
lecture, and then

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
ended just the way we did the
previous one, with, hopefully,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
another attempt to bring
this stuff to life, which

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is to give the household
money incomes denoted

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.540 align:middle line:84%
by a first date or
second date, and then

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
talk about price changes.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So it is about the distinction
between income and substitution

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But here, unlike income as
exogenous and moving around,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
you have money incomes
in the two dates.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:84%
All we're doing is
changing prices.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:84%
We're changing the price
of the good at date two

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:84%
relative to the price
of the good at date one.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So there were two
different pictures here

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether initially,
the household, as here,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.900 align:middle line:84%
is a lender, eating less
than its initial endowment.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.010 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
an income effect.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You can see that as we move
from the solid blue line

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:84%
to the pale blue line, in
this upper quadrant at least,

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:00.220 align:middle line:84%
the new budget line lies
further toward the northeast

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:90%
than the original one.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And since they started
here, locally the effect

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:84%
of the interest change is
to give them more income.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
to end up with higher

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:90%
consumption of the second good.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:84%
They could have ended up
with lower consumption.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard
to focus in there.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I have to put it right
there or something.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a little bit
lower than it was initially,

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's despite the
increase in income.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's the case
where the substitution

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:90%
effect is getting washed out.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So again, here, they
start out as a borrower,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and now when the
interest rate goes up,

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
they clearly have less income,
which intuitively makes sense

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.600 align:middle line:84%
because they were
already borrowing.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And an increase in
the interest rate

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.060 align:middle line:84%
can only increase the amount
of debt if they stay put.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.700 align:middle line:90%
But they would not stay put.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Then the two effects have to
do with income and substitution

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.330 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They have the same sign
for consumption today,

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
but opposing signs for
consumption tomorrow.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think I went
back the next class

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and made the comment that this
is an important stepping stone

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
toward modeling entire
economies because we're giving

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:90%
the household an endowment.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:84%
In the labor example,
we gave the household

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:90%
an endowment of time.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're giving the household
an endowment of money income

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:90%
in each of two periods.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So the endowments are
part of an economy.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Preferences are clearly
being described here.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Production was suppressed
because it's just

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.110 align:middle line:90%
a consumer problem.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.319 align:middle line:90%
So that was lecture three.

00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Next up is lecture four.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.690 align:middle line:90%
So I may speed up a little bit.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.870 align:middle line:84%
That said, there's a ton
of stuff in lecture four,

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and we did not get through it
deliberately the first time.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
There's three or four
slides at the end

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that we moved to
the next lecture.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Because by topic,
it's about production,

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:84%
but there are just too
many important concepts.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Repeat-- preferences,
endowment, technology-- now

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:90%
zero in on technology.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.340 align:middle line:84%
That question that
we were discussing

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.660 align:middle line:84%
about describe medieval
villages as an economy also

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:84%
made reference to Northern
Thai villages as an economy.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Here's the picture.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:90%
So what's the technology here?

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Land, labor, and capital
are used as inputs

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.730 align:middle line:90%
to produce this crop.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So this, in many respects,
should not have been hard.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
I'm not asking you

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
to memorize all these
beautiful pictures,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:84%
just saying that because
I took this picture.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So production-- we have
inputs and negative, outputs,

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:50.170 align:middle line:84%
which are positive, and vectors,
and indexed by particular goods

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and by firms, potentially.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:84%
We have this production
possibility set,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:84%
where inputs being negative,
like labor over here,

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and outputs being positive.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:84%
This one displays a region
of increasing and decreasing

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.510 align:middle line:84%
returns to scale, to
be defined momentarily.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
We went through these properties
of production functions.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was a good
discussion coming up, namely

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:84%
decreasing constant and
increasing returns to scale.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:84%
This was the picture of
decreasing returns to scale.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture of
increasing returns.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a "typo" because
according to the definition,

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:84%
you should take a point
in the production set

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and multiply it by a
lambda greater than 1,

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:90%
which I mentioned in class.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We have not tried to
correct the picture.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
That's because
what this displays

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.840 align:middle line:84%
is a violation of
decreasing returns

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
relative to them being
satisfied on the left.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not satisfied
on the right.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So the picture is
not wrong, it's just

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
not a direct use of the
definition of increasing

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:84%
returns, and this
was constant returns.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is aggregating
production sets.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This one plus this one equals
this one plus the endowments.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lovely
discussion on Piazza

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:84%
about this thing, which is,
have we generated a free lunch?

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Evidently from the
picture, the answer

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:20.010 align:middle line:84%
is no because there is that
finite production possibilities

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.773 align:middle line:90%
frontier over here.

00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where
you are, you're

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:84%
using one as an
input and the other

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:90%
as an output or vice versa.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
The possibility is
created here, however,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that you use x as the input,
getting y as the output.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Take y as the output,
put it in as an input

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:90%
in the second technology.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Take y as the input,
get x as the output.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you kept going like that,
and you got more in output

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
than you used in input after
going through one cycle,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:90%
you could go to infinity.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.240 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no end to it.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.920 align:middle line:84%
It would not only
be a free lunch,

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:90%
it'd be an infinite lunch.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
You could just keep
going, in which case,

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
although it's not
entirely obvious,

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
you could never
draw this picture

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.510 align:middle line:90%
because there'd be no boundary.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.950 align:middle line:90%
You'd always be in the interior.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:84%
You could always do
better just by cloning.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we define the firm's
problem, maximizing profits.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:90%
We drew these pictures.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, you get into the
habit, if you're an economist-

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:90%
maximize subject to.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Maximize linear function
subject to convex constraints.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:84%
You end up with
these tangent cases.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.720 align:middle line:84%
In this case, these
are isoprofit lines

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:90%
not isobudget lines.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We want to move out as far as
we can on the isoprofit line.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But the tangency
is a similar thing

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:84%
if we move across these
applications from consumer

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:90%
theory to producer theory.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, it's starting
to become second nature.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:84%
We defined properties of
the production function,

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:90%
including convexity.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:90%
And we proved it.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And then almost out of order,
this definition of homogeneity

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:90%
popped up.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So one thing we didn't do
was link these definitions

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:84%
of homogeneity of functions
back to the discussion

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of increasing, decreasing,
and constant returns to scale.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But you should be
able to do that.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:84%
This was a proof of
Hotelling's lemma.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was an illustration
of the envelope

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
theorem, which is
another tool that's

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:90%
going to keep popping up.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Special versions of
profit maximization,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:90%
cost minimization--

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.230 align:middle line:84%
so this is like the dual, except
this one's going to get used,

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:90%
not just to show equivalence.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:90%
What I mean by that is this--

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:84%
so we have this isoproduction
curve called isoquant,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to try to find
the cost-minimizing bundle that

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.853 align:middle line:84%
allows you to achieve that
given level of output.

00:39:51.853 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Then you could do
two experiments.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Just like with the
household, we varied

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:90%
income and varied prices.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Here, you can vary prices.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
Walt Disney thing.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So the input mix would change.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:84%
What you could also
do, although we

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
decided not to
overwhelm you, is pick

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.720 align:middle line:90%
a different level of output--

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.010 align:middle line:84%
a higher level-- and find the
cost-minimizing combination

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of inputs to support
that higher output.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And the definition of a
cost curve was defined.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Cost function takes the
input prices as given,

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:28.650 align:middle line:90%
but also the output.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
obvious when you say it.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the cost of
producing a given output.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's true.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:90%
But we never showed the picture.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.160 align:middle line:90%
But we did show the costs.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.530 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting
here in this slide.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Average cost, marginal
costs, and what

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:84%
happens when you change prices
with constant returns to scale?

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If the price were
too high, the outcome

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:84%
would not be well
defined because they

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:90%
would make infinite profit.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when I presented
this, I said there was a typo,

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:90%
and there is no typo.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:90%
So I apologize twice.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
What's going on is the
dialogue in the text below is

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:14.760 align:middle line:84%
moving from here to the
intermediate line to this line.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So when price of the
output is going up,

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:90%
this thing is going down.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:90%
These lines are getting flatter.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And when they get sufficiently
flat, then you go ballistic

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and you can make infinite
profits, which is

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.440 align:middle line:90%
consistent with this diagram.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Except that it's never
defined at a higher price

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.970 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
determinate outcome.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Then this thing
I will set aside,

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:84%
but again, I asked you to try
to write down a little bit

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:48.100 align:middle line:84%
better proof that these input
ratios are constant when you

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.260 align:middle line:90%
have constant returns to scale.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Although this is a version
of in consumer theory,

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the idea that with
homothetic utility,

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.590 align:middle line:84%
the expenditure shares
don't move, and so on.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.070 align:middle line:90%
So it is related to that.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:05.620 align:middle line:84%
This was a picture
of Robinson Crusoe.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.310 align:middle line:84%
This was the first general
equilibrium economy

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:84%
although it was only one
person, with a production

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.930 align:middle line:90%
set and preferences.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:84%
When I said you should be
able to take that labor supply

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and convert it by making
the labor supply negative,

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I had this in mind, except
that unlike a production set,

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.030 align:middle line:84%
you just have a straight budget
line emanating from the origin,

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you would
maximize utility.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:84%
You're just basically flipping
the diagram from right

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to left like an overlay.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:90%
But here, there is production.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was an exciting
part because we got to trade.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking about a
real, live economy with two

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:84%
goods, agriculture and
output, and looking

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:84%
at what the consumer would do
if they were maximizing utility

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.150 align:middle line:84%
subject to that production
set, as opposed to what

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:84%
they would do if they were able
to trade in the world economy.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They would produce more
of the manufacturing good,

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and export it, and consume
both goods in such a way

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.580 align:middle line:90%
that their utility is higher.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- I can't
remember if I emphasized it,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
but this illustrates
the gains to trade.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the gains to trade for a
single consumer like Robinson

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Crusoe, which you
can see evidently

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:84%
has higher utility
because they get

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.670 align:middle line:90%
to trade away from the origin.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we
should ask ourselves

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.470 align:middle line:84%
whether this is a realistic
description of the economy

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.110 align:middle line:84%
or whether we should
populate it with more people,

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and potentially have
heterogeneous utility

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:41.252 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:43:41.252 --> 00:43:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we're going
to need to talk about

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.220 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we
can aggregate up,

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:49.970 align:middle line:84%
which comes up in lecture 15
or 16, or something like that.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is the US and England
trading with one another.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to be brief.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're
going to go over.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.730 align:middle line:84%
This is decision making
under uncertainty, and also

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.410 align:middle line:90%
illustrative of linear programs.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think on this
one in particular,

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I want you to let me know
if you have questions.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:90%
It is a bit unnatural.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:90%
This part's all very natural.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It just has to do with
a household evaluating

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:84%
nontrivial lotteries
over prizes, although we

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:84%
used it to define means
and variances, coefficients

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of variation, and
variances, and correlations.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:90%
We did all of that.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But then we went back to
the award or the prize

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.770 align:middle line:84%
being two-dimensional, in
this case, goods X1 and X2.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is a discrete,
non-convex consumption set.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And miraculously, we turned
it into a convex-looking set.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And we had a good
discussion at the beginning

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:middle line:84%
of the following class
about how to do that.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But I want to make sure
you all understand it,

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.410 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to build
on it in subsequent lectures.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So one of you asked
me in my office hours,

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.290 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of weird--
in finance, you

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:84%
take as given the returns on
the assets or their beliefs

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.790 align:middle line:90%
about the returns.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:11.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about
choosing the returns.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But here you do, because
you're choosing the lottery.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You're choosing a
random way, although it

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.210 align:middle line:90%
could be subject to a budget.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm practically out of time.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.690 align:middle line:90%
We went to concave utility.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:25.570 align:middle line:84%
We talked about behavior
under risk, different types

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of utility functions,
this tree that we

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
keep coming back to that was
at the end of the lecture

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
last time.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.260 align:middle line:84%
This is Arrow-Debreu security,
so in this case, instead

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.168 align:middle line:84%
of having a pure borrowing and
lending economy or borrowing

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:40.210 align:middle line:84%
subject to a credit limit,
we could have had them

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:84%
trading in an asset which
yields a return of 1

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:84%
in one state and nothing
in the other states.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And you could be either making
that promise as a borrower,

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.290 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, or buying
it as an investor.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So we can go from
medieval villages

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:90%
to sophisticated securities.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we kind of talked about
this at the beginning of class.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And this class ended with
linear programming problems

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and how they crop up in
general in utility maximization

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and linear activity analysis.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
This linear activity analysis
is the Leontief thing

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I was alluding to when
we went over preferences.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.170 align:middle line:90%
These are constants.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:26.560 align:middle line:84%
These A a j is the amount
of good i, input i,

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.830 align:middle line:84%
required to produce good
j, and it's a constant.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The rate of substitution
isn't varying

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that delivers these
l-shaped isoquants.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:39.870 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I'm going to have
to stop because otherwise we're

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.460 align:middle line:90%
going to go over.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.110 align:middle line:90%
So we almost got to the end.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I have anything
usually uncovered anyway.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the other
two lectures were

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.650 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics, which should be
fresh in your mind-- we just

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.140 align:middle line:84%
covered it recently--
and the one

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that we did and reviewed at
the beginning of the lecture

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.150 align:middle line:84%
today on Pareto-optimal
allocations.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:12.000 align:middle line:90%

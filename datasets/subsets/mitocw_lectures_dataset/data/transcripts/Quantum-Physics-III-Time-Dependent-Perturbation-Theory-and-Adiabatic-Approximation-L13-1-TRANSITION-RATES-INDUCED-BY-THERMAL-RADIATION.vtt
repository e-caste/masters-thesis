00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.800
PROFESSOR: Today we're going to
finish our discussion of atoms

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.430
and light in interaction
and finally get

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.140
some of those rates.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.490
Last time, we reviewed
the Einstein's argument.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.900
Einstein used his argument
to discover spontaneous--

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.870
stimulated emission
of radiation and how

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.300
it accompanies the process
of absorption all the time.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.510
There was also, of
course, this process

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.540
of spontaneous radiation
that we found the formula

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.410
for that transition rate
in terms of the transition

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.560
rate for stimulated radiation.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.270
So let me review a couple
of things that we had.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.450
So we have an electric field
that interacts with the atom.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:03.800
There's a position vector
that points to the charge, q.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.000
And we have two levels,
level b with energy E b

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.730
and level a with energy E a.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.360
We introduce a dipole
moment operator,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.570
which was defined as q times r.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.240
And it's an operator
because r is an operator.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.010
The position is an operator
in quantum mechanics.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.870
So we observe, and we've
observed several times,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.460
that the process is b going
to a of stimulated emission

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.510
and the process of a
going to b of absorption

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.160
are the same, not
equivalent, the same.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.670
The first order in
perturbation theory, and we

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.110
wrote, last time,
the formula for it

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.669
using our general formula
for harmonic transitions.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.250
Not firm is golden
rule, because this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.900
was a discrete
transition, apparently,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.325
between these two levels.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.780
So here is the formula.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.865
Let me remind you what it was.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
There was an electric field.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.160
It was of the form 2E 0 cosine
omega t times the vector n.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.660
OK.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.030
All our results from the
discussion of light and atoms

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.140
from the previous
lecture, so here we go.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.910
The transition probability
as a function of time

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.670
is given by this quantity, n
0 is half the peak amplitude

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.470
of the electric field.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.460
We always have
this extra 2 here.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.770
d ab are the matrix
elements of the operator d

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.060
between the states
here, a and b.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.350
So that's an inner product.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.280
This is dotted with
the vector n that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.700
refers to the polarization
of the electric field.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.130
That half number is squared.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.830
And then we have the sine
squared over x squared function

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.620
that we've usually had.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.260
So this is our situation.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.400
But what's going to happen,
what we're interested

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.060
and the situation that
Einstein was considering,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.660
was when you had a box,
you had thermal radiation.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.140
And those atoms were there.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.280
Here, we have a discrete
process of transition

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.490
from one state to another state.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.399
Neither one is a continuum.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.640
When we had ionization,
we were going

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.820
from one state bound to the
continuum of flying electrons.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.980
And therefore, a Fermi golden
rule arose by integration.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.550
Here, what are we to integrate?

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.040
Well, there is
something to integrate.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.190
The fact of the
matter is that when

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.340
you have this
black-body radiation,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:53.550
you will have a spectrum,
omega, of electric fields.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.650
You don't just have
one electric field

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.760
at one specific frequency.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.980
You will have many components
of the electric field

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.830
at different frequencies
at different directions.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.280
So in particular, when you
have a black-body over this,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.130
you will have, in this
spectrum, here is omega ba.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.760
That is the frequency
for which the transitions

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.280
tend to be more important.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.090
Remember, when you're
omega, your frequency omega

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.820
is the frequency of
the external light.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.670
When your frequency
omega coincides

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.000
with the omega of
this transition,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.850
this stimulated emission or
the absorption get enhanced.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.000
So here is omega ba.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.430
That's one of the frequencies
in the black-body of radiation.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.300
But there are many,
many more nearby.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.610
And they are incoherent.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.220
That is, in the
black-body of radiation,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.300
each amplitude for a
different frequency

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.340
is independent of
the other ones.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.170
They're, like, random.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.350
So here is our sum, therefore.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.650
We must, we know, that when we
have several inputs, not just

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.720
one electric field but
many electric fields,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.970
we will have to add the
transition probability caused

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.940
by the different
electric fields.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.420
And in this case,
we will have to sum

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.550
the effects of
the electric field

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.800
squares of the many components
of the black-body of radiation

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.520
that lie near this omega ba.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.420
That is the one that would
trigger a transition.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.670
So this is how we're
going to obtain

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.610
something that will look like a
Fermi golden rule as well here.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.480
There is a transition.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.590
The transition is
between discrete states.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.550
But the trigger
for the transition

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.150
is a superposition of
electromagnetic waves

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.030
that we have to integrate over.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:25.370
So one can say that the
electric field, electric field

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:50.180
is a superposition of incoherent
waves with different omega i's,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:58.610
different frequencies,
different E 0 of omega i,

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:08.530
different amplitudes, and
different vectors, unit

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.080
vectors.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.550
So each mode of this
black-body radiation

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.050
has a different amplitude
and a different omega

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.150
and a different polarization.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:25.420
And we have to sum over
those that are near omega ba.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.330
And we know only over near
ones, because this function

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.890
doesn't allow you to--

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.240
or it becomes too small
when you get far away

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.940
from that central frequency.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.140
So as a first step, I can
rewrite this transition

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.350
probability to make
it a little clearer.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.980
I would say, here it is.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.030
The transition probability
for spontaneous emission

00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:01.360
of radiation associated
to a particular mode

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.660
of the radiation
field would be given

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:16.360
by 4E 0 of omega i
squared, h squared, d ab.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.730
That is some matrix element
of the dipole operator

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.410
in the atom.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.210
That doesn't depend
on anything having

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.610
to do with the radiation.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.710
n is possibly dependent
on the radiation.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:40.910
Sine squared of 1/2
omega ba minus omega i.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.605
The omega i is the omega
of the electric field.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.390
So I've put all these things
to represent the contribution

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.830
from the ith mode of
the radiation field

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.860
to the transition amplitude.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.130
That's what it does.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.760
So you could say,
oh, the ith mode

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.710
is one in which I
would write 2E 0 of i.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:24.380
So here would be 2E 0 of
omega i cosine of omega i t

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.800
times the vector n omega i.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:33.070
That's the ith mode
of the electric field.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.180
And that ith mode of
the electric field,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.680
that's this transition.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.450
And we have to sum
over all these modes

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.560
that are nearby here.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.550
OK.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.550
This is one of the
little non-trivial things

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.810
that we have to do now.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:11:01.280
But the way to think
about it is that we've

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.130
seen, from the
Einstein arguments

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:10.140
and in general black-body, that
there is a function u of omega,

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:16.340
which is the energy
density per unit frequency

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.710
so that when you
multiply by the omega,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.940
this is the energy
density contained

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.390
in the part of the spectrum
with a range d omega.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.900
That's your energy density.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.750
So that's an important
quantity because it

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.060
represents a number of photons.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:43.470
And that's how Einstein
argued that that defines or is

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.710
a part of the ingredient
of constructing

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.180
the rate at which transitions
would be happening.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.440
So we have to relate
this to energy.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.440
So let's try to
relate it to energy.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.520
So we use things from
electromagnetism,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.670
some basic facts from
electromagnetism.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.550
If you have-- so I'll go here.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:15.370
If you have a wave,
in general for a wave,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.520
you have an E field
and a B field.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.230
And you have energies u
electric and u magnetic.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.790
These are energy densities.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.810
And there's a simple
formula for them.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.460
The electric energy is
equal to the magnitude

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.460
of the electric field
squared over 8 pi.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.790
And in our case, the magnitude
of the electric field

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.730
is, the electric field
in our conventions,

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.860
is 2E 0 cosine omega t.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.270
So what do we get here?

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:08.460
4E 0 squared cosine
squared omega t over 8 pi.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.900
So this is 1 over 2
pi E 0 squared cosine

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.750
squared of omega t.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:23.750
But nobody really cares about
the fluctuation of the energy.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.380
You need the average
energy at the volume.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.520
So the time dependence
must be averaged.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:42.560
So from here, the average over
time of the electric field

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.020
energy density is the average
over time of cosine squared,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.910
which is 1/2.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:53.130
So we have 1 over
4 pi E 0 squared.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:59.420
So that's the average electric
field energy for a wave.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.310
And that's the
average over time.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:09.230
But in a electromagnetic wave,
the average electric energy

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.160
and the average magnetic
energy are the same.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:29.520
So u M magnetic is equal to u
E. The averages are identical.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:36.030
And then the total energy
density, therefore, is--

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:42.680
therefore, total u,
it's already average.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:54.230
Energy density would be u
E plus u M, which is 2u E.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:15:01.110
And it's, therefore, 1
over 2 pi E 0 squared.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.740
So our end result is
that the energy density

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:14.300
u is 1 over 2 pi E 0 squared.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:14.800
OK.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.530
Usually the thing
here that is important

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.640
is that there's lots
of factors of 2.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.300
There's factors of 2 in
defining the energy density,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.970
in averaging over
time, in adding

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.990
electric and magnetic
contributions up.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.670
This is correct.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.340
It's important to get
those factors of 2 right,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.160
otherwise your final
formulas will be off.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:53.190
So here is-- the end result
is a nice formula that

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.510
allows you to rewrite the
amplitude of your oscillation

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.730
in terms of its contribution
to the energy density.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.740
So here it goes.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.630
We can now think
of this by saying,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:17.600
if I have an electric field
squared at some frequency,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.570
well, that's 2 pi times the
energy density contributing

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:30.810
at that frequency, at just
the specialization of this

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:36.150
to an arbitrary frequency, an
omega i and an omega i here.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:51.330
So with this, we can now rewrite
this transition amplitude.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.120
The transition amplitude
can be now expressed

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.540
in terms of energy densities.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.400
So what do we have?

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:11.880
We have p b to a of t
i would be equal to 4.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.910
That 4 remains there.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:23.480
And then instead of E 0 squared,
we put 2 pi u of omega i

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.609
over h squared.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.760
And not much changes anymore.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:37.070
The ab n omega i
squared sine squared

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:46.310
of 1/2 omega ba minus
omega i t over omega ba

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.910
minus omega i squared.

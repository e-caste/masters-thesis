WEBVTT

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.740
What is the purpose
of the corporation?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.250
This is one of the
most controversial

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.730
and perhaps one of the
most important questions

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.810
that we need to
address in this course

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.190
and that you will need to
address as the next generation

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.410
workforce leaders.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.070
Why is this the case?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.940
Well, because American
CEOs have answered

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.700
this in two different ways.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700
From the 1940s through the '70s
and '80s and into the 1990s,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.660
there was a broad view of
the corporation that has now

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.200
narrowed down to focus
on maximizing shareholder

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.560
value in the short run.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.500
Here's a quote from the CEO
of Sonesta Hotels, Roger

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.380
Sonnabend.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.680
He says, "Social responsibility
and expanding profitability

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.390
are not at odds
with one another.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.680
Quite the contrary.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.890
They are two faces
of the same coin."

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.960
That view was shared by a
lot of CEOs of his era--

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.300
best illustrated
perhaps by graduates

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.950
of this important institution
called the Harvard Business

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.170
School.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.450
The class of 1949 is known for
producing an enormous number

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.460
of CEOs that spread across the
economy over the next decade

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.320
or two.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.960
Many of them had been
veterans of World War II.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.720
In fact, 90% went to the Harvard
Business School on the GI Bill.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.890
Many of them were
first-time college students

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.880
in their families.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.660
Many of them grew up
during the Depression,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.070
and they were imprinted by
the hardships of that time

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.700
as well as a commitment
to community service

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.090
that was embedded in
them during World War II.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.520
So they had a particular
view of their responsibility.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.720
Let's start with an example from
one of the best-known companies

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.860
of the 1950s through the '80s.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.340
Xerox-- one of the
companies that was a pioneer

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.950
high-technology company--

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.390
lead in the development
of office products.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.620
And it was led, from 1968 to
1982, by Peter McColough--

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.990
one of those graduates of
Harvard Business School,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.840
class of 1949.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.560
Peter McColough graduated
and went to work at Xerox,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.940
worked his way up through
various managerial capacities,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.830
became CEO in 1968.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.190
Xerox was located in
Rochester, New York, where

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.340
they had manufacturing
operations,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.700
and McColough
believed very strongly

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.230
that the role of the CEO was
to be a good corporate citizen

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.210
in the community.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.500
He worked very hard
to improve education,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.750
to build strong community
colleges, which then provided

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.590
a very competent workforce
for his organization

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.100
and for others in the region.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.820
He worked on local
and national politics.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.260
He worked closely
with the labor union

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.450
that represented
the manufacturing

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.940
employees at Xerox.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.780
They were among the first
to develop, for example,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.410
quality-of-working-life programs
and quality circle improvements

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.260
to improve productivity
and to compete with growing

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.780
international competition
in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.150
And in particular, he
believed very strongly

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.530
at developing talent from
within the organization

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.350
and particularly led the
way for developing talent

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.700
among women and among
minorities within Xerox.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.150
So it's not an accident
that, in 2002, Anne

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.060
became the CEO of Xerox--
one of the first women

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.530
to rise to that level of
authority in American industry.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.120
And it's not surprising then,
in 2012, that when Anne retired,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.120
the first African American
CEO of a very large Fortune

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.940
100 company--

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.220
Ursula Burns-- succeeded her.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.660
And the culture carried forward.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.880
The same view of corporate
social responsibility

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.800
can be seen in the
words of these CEOs

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.390
as was the case with
Peter McColough.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.770
So if you look on Xerox's
Social Responsibility Report

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.530
on the web, you'll
find currently

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.540
the same words that mirror
what McColough stood for.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.320
Quote, "Since our
earliest days, Xerox's

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.649
has embarked on a
neverending journey

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.850
to demonstrate that good
business and good citizenship

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.080
are not only compatible
but are synergistic."

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.950
The report then goes on to talk
about customer satisfaction,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.990
innovation via patents,
community participation,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.280
avoidance of workforce
injuries, and so on,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.310
employee participation
in community affairs, all

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.960
as part of what they believe
are the responsibilities

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.940
of the modern corporation.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.470
This was the dominant
view, not only of Xerox,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.740
during this time, but also
of other corporations--

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.960
best-illustrated by the
statements of the Business

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.420
Roundtable, the largest
corporate association

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.410
of executives from
the 200 largest

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.120
companies in the United States.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.590
And as late as 1990,
the Business Roundtable

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.680
made the following
public statement:

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.340
"Corporations are chartered
to serve their shareholders

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.310
and society as a whole.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.410
The interests of
shareholders are primarily

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.930
measured, of course, by
economic returns over time.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.080
The other stakeholders
in the corporation

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.960
are its employees, its
customers, its suppliers,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.710
its creditors, its communities
where the corporation does

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.000
its business and society as
a whole, and all of these

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.010
are vital to the long-term
economic performance

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.920
of the corporation."

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.370
That's the view up until
around the mid-1990s.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.870
By this time,
business is convinced

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.060
that it should focus
on shareholder value.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.230
And so the Business
Roundtable says, "In our view,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.200
the paramount duty of management
and the board of directors

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.480
is to the corporation's
stockholders.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.720
The interests of
other stakeholders

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.870
are relevant only as derivative
of the duty to stockholders.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.010
The notion that the
board of directors

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.710
must somehow balance all
of these other stakeholder

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.000
interests fundamentally
misconstrues

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.630
the role of the directors
and the responsibility

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.030
of the corporation."

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.100
Well, this is a big change.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.980
What caused this change?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.710
Well, it was a
revolution in ideas

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.850
about the corporation
that came largely

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.830
from the academic
literature of the time.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.250
The leading finance professors
of the time, Fischer Black

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.480
and Bob Merton at MIT and
their colleague Myron Scholes

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.530
at the University of
Chicago had developed

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.850
a formula for better
ways of pricing options--

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.560
that is, shareholder stock--

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.010
so that you could use stock
options to compensate for CEOs.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.407
Their formula made it easier
to use these processes,

00:06:55.407 --> 00:06:57.490
and then colleagues at the
Harvard Business School

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.560
published a number
of papers saying

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.000
we ought to tie shareholder
value to CEO compensation

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.910
through the use
of stock options.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.850
And you saw the role
of stock options grow.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.760
You saw the CEO compensation
grow from what used to be about

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.010
a ratio of 30 to 1-- that is,
the CEO earned about 30 times

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.840
the average employee
in the firm--

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.900
to today, where it's
well over 300 to 1.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.050
Well, what was the
consequence of all of this?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.220
One of the examples
that we could

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.400
turn to is another venerable
company, STANLEY Tools--

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.440
a company that was
a household term

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.220
because every toolbox
in America had

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.750
good wrenches and other tools
made by the STANLEY Corporation

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.610
in Connecticut.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.360
It was a very
socially-responsible company

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.490
until the board of
directors got taken over,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.160
and someone said let's really
focus on shareholder value.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.920
And so a new CEO
was brought in place

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.350
and started to lay people off,
not as a last resort because

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.430
of economic necessity,
but as a preemptive step

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.710
to try to boost
shareholder value.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.560
More and more
companies did that.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.000
And in fact, that led New York
Times reporter Louis Uchitelle

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.700
to write a very well-known
book called The Disposable

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.420
American basically
chronicling how

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.580
American corporations changed
their behavior over time.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.260
Did it really benefit
shareholders all that much?

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.500
Well, if you look at the data,
the data show that shareholders

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.490
got about the same rate
of return-- about 7%--

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.600
in the old stakeholder
era as they

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.020
were getting in the
shareholder era.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.049
If you had just forced
some of this restructuring,

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:41.270
in fact, their rate of
return goes down a little bit

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.870
from the previous time period.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.420
So we've imposed a lot
of costs on society,

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.430
but have we really
benefited the shareholders

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.930
as the theory might suggest?

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.070
That's a question that
you will have to answer.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.090
The era of maximizing
shareholder value

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.540
in the short run
is still with us.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.460
Does this work for the future?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.500
Does it work for
your generation?

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.760
That's a question
that you will need

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.590
to address as you shape
the work, the workforce,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.740
and the corporation
of the future.

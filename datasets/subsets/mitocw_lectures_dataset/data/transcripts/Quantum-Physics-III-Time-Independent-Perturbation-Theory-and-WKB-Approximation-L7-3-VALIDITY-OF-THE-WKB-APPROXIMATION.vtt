00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:09.180
PROFESSOR: So let's try
to do return to seeing,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.040
OK, we solved equation.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.500
We seem to be OK.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.260
What did we really approximate?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.220
We didn't approximate
saying h bar goes to 0.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.700
We did a more serious
physical approximation.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.340
And let's try to see
what we really did.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:41.040
So I think the whole clue is
in this top equation there.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.500
You have the first term
and the second term.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.770
And our claim is
that the second term

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.270
is smaller than the first
term with h bar there.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.880
So for example-- now of
course, in this solution,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.520
the first term is identically
0 and the second term,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
the coefficient of h
bar, is identically 0.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.480
But we can look at one of those,
for example, and say that--

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.940
so the validity of
the approximation.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.970
Validity of the approximation.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.460
It's pretty useful to do this.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:36.550
So we say, for example
there, that term, h bar

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.100
s0 double prime that
enters into the order h bar

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.930
part of the equation,
the absolute value of it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.390
must be much smaller than
a typical term s0 prime,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.050
for example, s0 prime
squared, in the first term.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.270
So each term-- so
basically, I'm saying

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.600
each term in the first
bracket must be much larger

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.290
than each term in
the second bracket.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.260
And you could have picked
any ones because they're

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.480
all equal, after all.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.970
So let's see if
that is the case.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.050
So recall that s0 prime
from there is really

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.870
p of x plus minus p of x.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.860
So what do we have here? h bar
and s0 double prime is dp vx.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
Must be much smaller
than p of x squared.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.510
Now it's a matter of playing
with these things a little bit

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.840
until you find some way that
the equality tells you story.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.870
And the way I'll
do it is by saying

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.740
that this is h bar 1
over p squared of x

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.940
dp vx is much smaller than 1.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.970
And here I'll write
this as h bar d--

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.395
no h bar.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.920
ddx of h bar over p.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.590
Look what I did.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.410
ddx of 1 over p is 1 over
p squared dp vx and the h

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.460
bar I put it there.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.350
Here we go.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.770
What does this say?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.360
This is the local De
Broglie wave length.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.930
This is saying that
ddx of the local

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.240
the De Broglie wave length
must be much smaller than 1.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.870
A nice result, your local
De Broglie wavelength

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.160
must have a small derivative.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.180
So this is the
physics translation

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.000
of the semi-classical
approximation. h bar going to 0

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.820
is a mathematical device,
but this is physical.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.270
This is telling you
what should happen.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.940
Most of us look at that
and see an easier way

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.040
to understand that equation.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.410
v lambda vx.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.940
It has the right units.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.530
Lambda has units of length.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.850
x has units of length.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.640
So that derivative
must have no units.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.960
And if it's supposed
to be small,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.980
it should be small
compared to 1.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.610
So this is the
conventional inequality.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.400
Most of us would prefer,
maybe, to write it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.650
like this-- lambda d lambda dx
is much smaller than lambda.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.860
And I think this is a
little clearer because this

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.670
is how much the De Broglie
wave length changes

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.570
over a distance equal to
the De Broglie wavelength.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.130
So you have a De Broglie wave
length and the next De Broglie

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.890
wave length.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.590
How much did it change?

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.610
That must be small compared
to the De Broglie wavelength.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.765
So the change of
the De Broglie wave

00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:37.110
length after you move one
De Broglie wave length

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.110
must be smaller than the
De Broglie wave length.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.300
I don't know if you like it.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.060
Otherwise, you
can take this one.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.960
I'll do another one, another
version of the inequalities.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.860
And you can play with
those inequalities.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.080
It kind of takes a while
until you convince yourself

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.390
that you're not
missing anything.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.240
Think of p squared equal
to m e minus v of x.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.100
Take a derivative, vvx.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.730
So I'll have p, p prime.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.100
This is 2 pp prime.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.660
But with this 2, I'm
going to cancel it.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.670
At some point, of course, we're
taking all kinds of factors

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.780
of 2 and ignoring them.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.580
Remember that true De
Broglie wave length is h over

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.620
p not h bar over p.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.120
Factors-- by the time you go
to this inequality, two pis

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.400
are gone.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.530
m.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.230
We're differentiating
with respect

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.540
to x and taking absolute value.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.960
So we'll write it like this.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:04.250
Or vvvx vx equals
1 over m pp prime.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.610
That is so far exact.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.665
Let me multiply by a lambda.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.185
So I'll have a lambda.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:44.200
And a lambda, vv dx,
is equal to lambda.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.830
OK.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.010
Lambda is h bar over p.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:54.635
So I can cancel one of these p's
and get h bar over m p prime.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.770
OK.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.540
H bar over m p prime.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.880
Now, look at this equation.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.380
I'm sorry.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.000
We'll play with this a little--

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.330
like, trial and error.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.440
You're trying to move
around your inequality.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.220
So here we have
something-- h bar

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.310
dp dx is much less than that.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:28.830
So this term is because
of this inequality

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.100
is much smaller than
p squared over m.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.610
And now we have something nice.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.100
I'll write it here.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:50.330
Lambda of x dv dx is much
smaller than p squared over 2m.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.300
That's another nice one.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.135
I think this one is the--

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:07.730
and this says that the potential
must be slowly varying for this

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.610
to be true because the change
in the potential over at the De

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.780
Broglie wavelength--
dv dx times lambda of x

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.705
is an estimate for the change
of the potential over the De

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:24.290
Broglie wavelength-- is much
smaller than the kinetic energy

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.320
of the particle.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.740
So that's, again, another
thing that makes sense.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.490
It's kind of nice.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:40.070
So this is the wave at
the end of the day, this h

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.920
bar going to zero
approximation has

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.570
become a physical statement.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.720
It is a statement of
quantities varying

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.610
slowly because after all, that's
what motivated the expansion

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.570
from the beginning.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.490
So let's see if we ever
get in trouble with this.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.530
So we're trying to solve
physical problems of particles

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.670
and potentials.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.990
And most of the times
we're interested in bound

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.540
states or energy eigenstates,
at least the simple energy

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.600
eigenstates are bound states.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.870
So here is a situation.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.780
We have a sketch of a situation.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.430
We have a v of x--

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.320
this is x.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.750
This is a.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.260
v of x-- and some energy, e.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.610
And let's assume we're
looking close enough

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.740
to the point x equals a so that
the v of x, however it curves,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.320
at that point is
roughly straight.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.120
That's a reasonable thing to do.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:12.200
So we'll model v of x minus e--

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.210
v of x minus e-- as being
linear near x equals a.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.450
So this is g times
x minus a, where

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.870
g is some positive
constant, which

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.590
is the slope at this point.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:42.510
So look at x less than a.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.630
At this point, you are
in the loud region.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:51.190
You're in the region to
the left of the point a

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.750
where your energy is
bigger than the potential.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.420
And that's perfectly allowed.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.280
So here, e minus v of x,
which is the negative of that,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.990
would be g a minus x.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:27.950
And p is square root of 2 m e
minus v of x, so g a minus x.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:28.780
That's p of x.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.890
So that's your position
dependent momentum.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.740
It's going to go
to 0 at that point.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:50.900
And lambda, which
is h bar over p,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.610
is h bar over square
root of 2 mg 1

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.620
over square root of a minus x.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.300
So take the derivative--

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.960
d lambda d x--

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.710
take the absolute value of it.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:20.570
That's h bar over square root of
2 mg times 1/2 1 over a minus x

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.110
to the three halves.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.050
We're differentiating
with respect to x.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.370
And now you see the trouble,
if you had not seen it

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:40.840
before, the validity of the
semi-classical approximation

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:48.610
is taken and requires d lambda
dx to be much smaller than 1.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:57.340
And as you approach x equals
to a, this grows without bound.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.880
It just becomes
bigger and bigger.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.800
You can choose g to be large and
you can choose m to be large.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.880
But still, you get closer and
closer, you eventually fail.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.890
This thing goes to
infinity as x goes to a

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.870
and grows without limit.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.050
And the semi-classical
approximation crashes.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:30.370
You know, I would imagine
that many people got this far

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.550
with this in my classical
approximation of writing

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.140
this and that.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:41.210
But this is a
tremendous obstacle.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.890
Why is it an obstacle?

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.680
Why can't we just
forget about that region

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.830
because most of the times you
dealing with bound states.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:56.120
So you will have a very
slowly varying potential here.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.650
But if you want to
find bound states,

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.920
you need the fact that there
is a forbidden region where

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.130
the wave function
destroys itself.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.970
So whatever you can solve
for the wave function

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.250
is slowly varying here.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.990
It's not enough because you
need to know how it decays.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.490
And therefore, you need
to face this corners

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.900
where the semi-classical
approximation fails.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:31.330
Our problem here is that we know
how to write a solution here.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
We probably know how to
write the solution here.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.210
Those are these ones.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.930
But we have no idea
how to write them here.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.320
So we cannot connect
the two solutions.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.970
It's a serious difficulty.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.510
So people work hard on that.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.540
And I think that
is the breakthrough

00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:00.450
of the construction of
this WKBP [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.560
What they did is they
solved the equation

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.450
exactly in this region,
assuming a linear potential.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.130
They solved it exactly.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:16.710
And then those functions, the
[INAUDIBLE] functions, show up.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.920
And you know how the
[INAUDIBLE] functions behave.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.930
So they solve it here.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.010
They related it to the solution
to the right, related it

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.690
to the solution on the left.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.240
And in that way,
even though we don't

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.270
have to write the
solution in this region,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.960
we know how a
solution on the middle

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.240
connects to a
solution on the right.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.470
This is the subject of the
connection formulas in WKB.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.990
We will discuss that
next time, or we'll

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.560
go through some of that analysis
because it's interesting

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.380
and fairly non-trivial.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.410
But I will mention one of the
connection formulas and use it.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.710
That's the rest of what
we're going to do today.

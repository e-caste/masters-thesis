00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.560
PROFESSOR: Last time we began
the development of the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.430
discrete-time Fourier
transform.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.350
And just as with the
continuous-time case, we first

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.710
treated the notion of
periodic signals.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.060
This led to the Fourier
series.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.350
And then we generalized that to
the Fourier transform, and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.080
finally incorporated within the
framework of the Fourier

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.070
transform both aperiodic
and periodic signals.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.820
In today's lecture, what I'd
like to do is expand on some

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.940
of the properties of the
Fourier transform, and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.875
indicate how those properties
are used for

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.770
a variety of things.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.470
Well, let's begin by reviewing
the Fourier transform as we

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.310
developed it last time.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.410
It, of course, involves a
synthesis equation and an

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.040
analysis equation.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.340
The synthesis equation
expressing x of n, the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.090
sequence, in terms of the
Fourier transform, and the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.880
analysis equation telling us
how to obtain the Fourier

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.890
transform from the original
sequence.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.480
And I draw your attention again
to the basic point that

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.650
the synthesis equation
essentially corresponds to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.660
decomposing the sequence as a
linear combination of complex

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.590
exponentials with amplitudes
that are, in effect,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.820
proportional to the
Fourier transform.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.290
Now, the discrete-time Fourier
transform, just as the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.380
continuous-time Fourier
transform, has a number of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.050
important and useful
properties.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.600
Of course, as I stressed last
time, it's a function of a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.140
continuous variable.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.870
And it's also a complex-valued
function, which means that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.680
when we represent it in
general it requires a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.860
representation in terms of its
real part and imaginary part,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.540
or in terms of magnitude
and angle.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.360
Also, as I indicated last time,
the Fourier transform is

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.600
a periodic function of
frequency, and the periodicity

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.030
is with a period of 2 pi.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.750
And so it says, in effect, that
the Fourier transform, if

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.110
we replace the frequency
variable by an integer

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.580
multiple of 2 pi, the
function repeats.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.680
And I stress again that the
underlying basis for this

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.080
periodicity property is the
fact that it's the set of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.560
complex exponentials that are

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.190
inherently periodic in frequency.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.040
And so, of course, any
representation using them

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.660
would, in effect, generate
a periodicity with

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.950
this period of 2 pi.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.320
Just as in continuous time,
the Fourier transform has

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.560
important symmetry properties.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.060
And in particular, if the
sequence x sub n is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.130
real-valued, then the
Fourier transform

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.680
is conjugate symmetric.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.420
In other words, if we replace
omega by minus omega, that's

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.930
equivalent to applying
complex conjugation

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.000
to the Fourier transform.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.780
And as a consequence of this
conjugate symmetry, this

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.880
results in a symmetry in the
real part that is an even

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.430
symmetry, or the magnitude has
an even symmetry, whereas the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.590
imaginary part or the phase
angle are both odd symmetric.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.850
And these are symmetry
properties, again, that are

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.480
identical to the symmetry
properties that we saw in

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.230
continuous time.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.820
Well, let's see this in the
context of an example that we

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.940
worked last time and that we'll
want to draw attention

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.960
to in reference to several
issues as this

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.730
lecture goes along.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.890
And that is the Fourier
transform of a real damped

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.330
exponential.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.330
So the sequence that we are
talking about is a to the n u

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.590
of n, and let's consider
a to be positive.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.060
We saw last time that the
Fourier transform for this

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.490
sequence algebraically
is of this form.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.860
And if we look at its magnitude
and angle, the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.110
magnitude I show here.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.120
And the magnitude, as
we see, has the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.130
properties that we indicated.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.400
It is an even function
of frequency.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.150
Of course, it's a function
of a continuous variable.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.400
And it, in addition,
is periodic with a

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.300
period of two pi.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.050
On the other hand, if we look
at the phase angle below it,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.310
the phase angle has a symmetry
which is odd symmetric.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.640
And that's indicated clearly
in this picture.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.100
And of course, in addition to
being odd symmetric, it

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.700
naturally has to be, again, a
periodic function of frequency

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.080
with a period of 2 pi.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.630
OK, so we have some symmetry
properties.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.220
We have this inherent
periodicity in the Fourier

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.260
transform, which I'm stressing
very heavily because it forms

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.060
the basic difference between
continuous time

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.170
and discrete time.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.420
In addition to these properties
of the Fourier

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.940
transform, there are a number
of other properties that are

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.820
particularly useful in the
manipulation of the Fourier

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.050
transform, and, in fact, in
using the Fourier transform

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.550
to, for example, analyze systems
represented by linear

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.660
constant coefficient difference
equations.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.410
There in the text is a longer
list of properties, but let me

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.490
just draw your attention
to several of them.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.210
One is the time shifting
property.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.620
And the time shifting property
tells us that if x of omega is

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.870
the Fourier transform of x of n,
then the Fourier transform

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.090
of x of n shifted in time is
that same Fourier transform

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.730
multiplied by this factor,
which is a

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.690
linear phase factor.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.670
So time shifting introduces
a linear phase term.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.410
And, by the way, recall that in
the continuous-time case we

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.530
had a similar situation, namely
that a time shift

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.050
corresponded to a
linear phase.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.260
There also is a dual to the time
shifting property, which

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.000
is referred to as the frequency
shifting property,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.520
which tells us that if we
multiply a time function by a

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.600
complex exponential,
that, in effect,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.030
generates a frequency shift.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.000
And we'll see this frequency
shifting property surface in a

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.310
slightly different way shortly,
when we talk about

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.840
the modulation property in
the discrete-time case.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.080
Another important property that
we'll want to make use of

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.390
shortly is linearity, which
follows in a very

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:36.860
straightforward way from the
Fourier transform definition.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.220
And the linearity property says
simply that the Fourier

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.510
transform of a sum, or linear
combination, is the same

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.020
linear combination of the
Fourier transforms.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.750
Again, that's a property that
we saw in continuous time.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:58.570
And, also, among other
properties there is a

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.790
Parseval's relation for the
discrete-time case that in

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.110
effect says something similar
to continuous time,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:10.750
specifically that the energy
in the sequence is

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.340
proportional to the energy in
the Fourier transform, the

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.370
energy over one period.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.820
Or, said another way, in fact,
or another way that it can be

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.760
said, is that the energy
in the time domain is

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.070
proportional to the
power in this

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.060
periodic Fourier transform.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.510
OK, so these are some
of the properties.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.750
And, as I indicated, parallel
somewhat properties that we

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.140
saw in continuous time.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.730
Two additional properties that
will play important roles in

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.530
discrete time just as they did
in continuous time are the

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.730
convolution property and the
modulation property.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.760
The convolution property is the
property that tells us how

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.100
to relate the Fourier transform
of the convolution

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.990
of two sequences to the Fourier
transforms of the

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.940
individual sequences.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.240
And, not surprisingly,
what happens--

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.530
and this can be demonstrated
algebraically--

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.390
not surprisingly, the Fourier
transform of the convolution

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.960
is simply the product of
the Fourier transforms.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.460
So, Fourier transform maps
convolution in the time domain

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.650
to multiplication in the
frequency domain.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.300
Now convolution, of course,
arises in the context of

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.610
linear time-invariant systems.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.120
In particular, if we have
a system with an impulse

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.710
response h of n, input x of n,
the output is the convolution.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.860
The convolution property then
tells us that in the frequency

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.780
domain, the Fourier transform is
the product of the Fourier

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.420
transform of the impulse
response and the Fourier

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.120
transform of the input.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.560
Now we also saw and have talked
about a relationship

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.950
between the Fourier transform,
the impulse response, and what

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:22.250
we call the frequency response
in the context of the response

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.840
of a system to a complex
exponential.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.030
Specifically, complex
exponentials are

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.210
eigenfunctions of linear
time-invariant systems.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.810
One of these into the system
gives us, as an output, a

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.070
complex exponential with the
same complex frequency

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.920
multiplied by what we refer
to as the eigenvalue.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.030
And as you saw in the video
course manual, this

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:56.010
eigenvalue, this constant,
multiplier on the exponential

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.530
is, in fact, the Fourier
transform of the impulse

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.520
response evaluated at
that frequency.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.700
Now, we saw exactly the same
statement in continuous time.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.280
And, in fact, we used
that statement--

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.860
the frequency response
interpretation of the Fourier

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.040
transform, the impulse
response--

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.710
we use that to motivate an
intuitive interpretation of

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.550
the convolution property.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.460
Now, formally the convolution
property can be developed by

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.840
taking the convolution sum,
applying the Fourier transform

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.240
sum to it, doing the appropriate
substitution of

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.810
variables, interchanging order
of summations, et cetera, and

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.800
all the algebra works out to
show that it's a product.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.610
But as I stressed when we
discussed this with continuous

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.550
time, the interpretation--

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.160
the underlying interpretation--

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.040
is particularly important
to understand.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.160
So let me review it again in
the discrete-time case, and

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.080
it's exactly the same for
discrete time or for

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.330
continuous time.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:10.100
Specifically, the argument was
that the Fourier transform of

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.760
a sequence or signal corresponds
to decomposing it

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.330
into a linear combination
of complex exponentials.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.310
What's the amplitude of those
complex exponentials?

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.990
It's basically proportional
to the Fourier transform.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.290
If we think of pushing through
the system that linear

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:35.220
combination, then each of those
complex exponentials

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:40.540
gets the amplitude modified, or
multiplied, by the Fourier

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.500
transform of--

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.110
by the frequency response--

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.670
which we saw is the
Fourier transform

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.130
of the impulse response.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.170
So the amplitudes of the output
complex exponentials is

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.240
then the amplitudes of the input
complex exponentials

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.470
multiplied by the frequency
response.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.240
And the Fourier transform of the
output, in effect, is an

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.450
expression expressing the
summation, or integration, of

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.790
the output as a linear
combination of all of these

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.400
exponentials with the
appropriate complex

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.580
amplitudes.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.720
So, it's important, in thinking
about the convolution

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.880
property, to think about it in
terms of nothing more than the

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.740
fact that we've decomposed the
input, and we're now modifying

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.410
separately through
multiplication, through

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.010
scaling, the amplitudes
of each of the complex

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.260
exponential components.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.780
Now what we saw in continuous
time is that this

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:56.390
interpretation and the
convolution property led to an

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.640
important concept, namely the
concept of filtering.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.140
Kind of the idea that if we
decompose the input as a

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.990
linear combination of complex
exponentials, we can

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.320
separately attenuate or
amplify each of those

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.910
components.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.190
And, in fact, we could exactly
pass some set of frequencies

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.160
and totally eliminate other
set of frequencies.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.430
So, again, just as in continuous
time, we can talk

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.130
about an ideal filter.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.820
And what I show here is the
frequency response of an ideal

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.990
lowpass filter.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:45.050
The ideal lowpass filter, of
course, passes exactly, with a

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:51.800
gain of 1, frequencies around
0, and eliminates totally

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.050
other frequencies.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.480
However, an important
distinction here between

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.530
continuous time and discrete
time is the fact that, whereas

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.540
in continuous time when we
talked about an ideal filter,

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.110
we passed a band of frequencies
and totally

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.070
eliminated everything else
out to infinity.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.070
In the discrete time case, the

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.210
frequency response is periodic.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:22.400
So, obviously, the frequency
response must periodically

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.430
repeat for the lowpass filter.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.700
And in fact we see that here.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.570
If we look at the lowpass
filter, then we've eliminated

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.240
some frequencies.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.260
But then we pass, of course,
frequencies around 2 pi, and

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.160
also frequencies around minus
2 pi, and for that matter

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.030
around any multiple of 2 pi.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.770
Although it's important to
recognize that because of the

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.310
inherent periodicity of the
complex exponentials, these

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.590
frequencies are exactly the
same frequencies as these

00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.670
frequencies.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.720
So it's lowpass filtering
interpreted in terms of

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.180
frequencies over a range
from minus pi to pi.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.670
Well, just as we talk about a
lowpass filter, we can also

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.609
talk about a highpass filter.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:19.500
And a highpass filter, of
course, would pass high

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.790
frequencies.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.460
In a continuous-time case,
high frequencies meant

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.050
frequencies that go
out to infinity.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.720
In the discrete-time case,
of course, the highest

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.800
frequencies we can generate
are frequencies up to pi.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.760
And once our complex
exponentials go past pi, then,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.570
in fact, we start seeing the
lower frequencies again.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.400
Let me indicate what I mean.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.560
If we think in the context of
the lowpass filter, these are

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.300
low frequencies.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.030
As we move along the frequency
axis, these become high

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.350
frequencies.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.490
And as we move further along the
frequency axis, what we'll

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.330
see when we get to, for example,
a frequency of 2 pi

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:09.030
are the same low frequencies
that we see around 0.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.900
In particular then, an ideal
highpass filter in the

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.790
discrete-time case would be a
filter that eliminates these

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:20.660
frequencies and passes
frequencies around pi.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:28.860
OK, so we've seen the
convolution property and its

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.760
interpretation in terms
of filtering.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.040
More broadly, the convolution
property in combination with a

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.470
number of the other properties
that I introduced, in

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.040
particular the time shifting and
linearity property, allows

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:49.290
us to generate or analyze
systems that are described by

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.100
linear constant coefficient
difference equations.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.330
And this, again, parallels very
strongly the discussion

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.650
we carried out in the
continuous-time case.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:08.510
In particular, let's think of a
discrete-time system that is

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.900
described by a linear constant

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.910
coefficient difference equation.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.470
And we'll restrict the initial
conditions on the equation

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.340
such that it corresponds to a
linear time-invariant system.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.360
And recall that, in fact, in
our discussion of linear

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.810
constant coefficient difference
equations, it is

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:31.230
the condition of initial rest
that-- on the equation--

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.240
that guarantees for us that
the system will be causal,

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.720
linear, and time invariant.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.790
OK, now let's consider a
first-order difference

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.340
equation, a system
described by a

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.740
first-order difference equation.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.260
And we've talked about
the solution of

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.160
this equation before.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.140
Essentially, we run the
solution recursively.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.370
Let's now consider generating
the solution by taking

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.270
advantage of the properties
of the Fourier transform.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.360
Well, just as we did in
continuous time, we can

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.870
consider applying the Fourier
transform to both sides of

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.210
this equation.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.520
And the Fourier transform
of y of n, of

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.680
course, is Y of omega.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.090
And then using the shifting
property, the time shifting

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:21.270
property, the Fourier transform
of y of n minus 1 is

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.520
Y of omega multiplied by
e to the minus j omega.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.180
And so we have this, using a
linearity property we can

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.840
carry down the scale factor, and
add these two together as

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.290
they're added here.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:39.020
And the Fourier transform
of x of n is X of omega.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.150
Well, we can solve this equation
for the Fourier

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.630
transform of the output in terms
of the Fourier transform

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.650
of the input and an appropriate

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.220
complex scale factor.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.170
And simply solving this
for Y of omega yields

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.800
what we have here.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.740
Now what we've used in going
from this point to this point

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:11.750
is both the shifting property
and we've also used the

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.000
linearity property.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.940
At this point, we can recognize
that here the

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.810
Fourier transform of the output
is the product of the

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:28.860
Fourier transform of the input
and some complex function.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.300
And from the convolution
property, then, that complex

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.480
function must in fact correspond
to the frequency

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.440
response, or equivalently, the
Fourier transform of the

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.620
impulse response.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.460
So if we want to determine the
Fourier transform of the--

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.170
or the impulse response of the
system, let's say for example,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:59.980
then it becomes a matter of
having identified the Fourier

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.080
transform of the impulse
response, which is the

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.500
frequency response.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.800
We now want to inverse
transform to

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.600
get the impulse response.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.730
Well, how do we inverse
transform?

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:15.420
Of course, we could do it by
attempting to go through the

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.880
synthesis equation for the
Fourier transform.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.520
Or we can do as we did in the
continuous-time case which is

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.362
to take advantage
of what we know.

00:22:25.362 --> 00:22:30.450
And in particular, we know that
from an example that we

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:36.910
worked before, this is in fact
the Fourier transform of a

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:43.960
sequence which is a to
the n times u of n.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.860
And so, in essence,
by inspection--

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.770
very similar to what has gone
on in continuous time--

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.900
essentially by inspection, we
can then solve for the impulse

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.400
response to the system.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.940
OK, so that procedure follows
very much the kind of

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.630
procedure that we've carried
out in continuous time.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.630
And this, of course, is
discussed in more

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.480
detail in the text.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.380
Well, let's look at
that example then.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.530
Here we have the impulse
response for that, associated

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.960
with the system described
by that

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.340
particular difference equation.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.630
And to the right of
that, we have the

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.140
associated frequency response.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.150
And one of the things
that we notice--

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:39.080
and this is drawn for a positive
between 0 and 1--

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.650
what we notice, in fact, is that
it is an approximation to

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.670
a lowpass filter, because it
tends to attenuate the high

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.380
frequencies and retain and,
in fact, amplify the low

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.520
frequencies.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.840
Now if instead, actually, the
impulse response was such that

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.540
we picked a to be negative
between minus 1 and 0, then

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.110
the impulse response in the time
domain looks like this.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.380
And the corresponding frequency

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.980
response looks like this.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.920
And that becomes an
approximation

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.790
to a highpass filter.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.330
So, in fact, a first-order
difference equation, as we

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.250
see, has a frequency response,
depending on the value of a,

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.930
that either looks approximately
like a lowpass

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.540
filter for a positive or
a highpass filter for a

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.360
negative, very much like the
first-order differential

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.560
equation looked like a
lowpass filter in the

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.710
continuous-time case.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:48.950
And, in fact, what I'd like to
illustrate is the filtering

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.340
characteristics--

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.680
or an example of filtering--

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.600
using a first-order difference
equation.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.400
And the example that I'll
illustrate is a filtering of a

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.190
sequence that in fact is
filtered very often for very

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.880
practical reasons, namely a
sequence which represents the

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.030
Dow Jones Industrial Average
over a fairly long period.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:17.040
And we'll process the Dow Jones
Industrial Average first

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.610
through a first-order difference
equation, where, if

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.460
we begin with a equals 0,
then, referring to the

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.760
frequency response that we have
here, a equals 0 would

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.960
simply be passing
all frequencies.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:37.140
As a is positive we start to
retain mostly low frequencies,

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:44.370
and the larger a gets, but still
less than 1, the more it

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.770
attenuates high frequencies
at the expense of low

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.270
frequencies.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:53.490
So let's watch the filtering,
first with a positive and

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.500
we'll see it behave as a lowpass
filter, and then with

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.270
a negative and we'll see the
difference equation behaving

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.020
as a highpass filter.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.520
What we see here is the Dow
Jones Industrial Average over

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:15.100
roughly a five-year period
from 1927 to 1932.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.470
And, in fact, that big dip in
the middle is the famous stock

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.010
market crash of 1929.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.190
And we can see that following
that, in fact, the market

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.030
continued a very long
downward trend.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:34.600
And what we now want to do
is process this through a

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.720
difference equation.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.950
Above the Dow Jones average we
show the impulse response of

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.020
the difference equation.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.080
Here we've chosen the parameter
a equal to 0.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.570
And the impulse response will
be displayed on an expanded

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:57.700
scale in relation to the scale
of the input and, for that

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.300
matter, the scale
of the output.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.900
Now with the impulse response
shown here which is just an

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:09.160
impulse, in fact, the output
shown on the bottom trace is

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.880
exactly identical
to the input.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.730
And what we'll want to do now
is increase, first, the

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:22.000
parameter a, and the impulse
response will begin to look

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.140
like an exponential with a
duration that's longer and

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.670
longer as a moves from 0 to 1.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.850
Correspondingly we'll get more
and more lowpass filtering as

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.300
the coefficient a increases
from 0 toward 1.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.340
So now we are increasing
the parameter a.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.300
We see that the bottom trace
in relation to the middle

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.480
trace in fact is looking more
and more smoothed or

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.700
lowpass-filtered.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.440
And here now we have a fair
amount of smoothing, to the

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.480
point where the stock market
crash of 1929 is totally lost.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.470
And in fact I'm sure there are
many people who wish that

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.090
through filtering we could, in
fact, have avoided the stock

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.940
market crash altogether.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:19.490
Now, let's decrease a from
1 back towards 0.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.410
And as we do that,
we will be taking

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.930
out the lowpass filtering.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.840
And when a finally reaches 0,
the impulse response of the

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.180
filter will again be an impulse,
and so the output

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.650
will be once again identical
to the input.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.000
And that's where we are now.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.930
All right now we want to
continue to decrease a so that

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.160
it becomes negative, moving
from 0 toward minus 1.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.890
And what we will see in that
case is more and more highpass

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.550
filtering on the output in
relation to the input.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.500
And this will be particularly
evident in, again, the region

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.090
of high frequencies represented
by sharp

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.160
transitions which, of course,
the market crash

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.870
of 1929 would represent.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:18.740
So here, now, a is decreasing
toward minus 1.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.140
We see that the high
frequencies, or rapid

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:29.230
variations are emphasized., And
finally, let's move from

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:35.620
minus 1 back towards 0, taking
out the highpass filtering and

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.390
ending up with a equal to 0,
corresponding to an impulse

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.290
response which is an
impulse, in other

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.010
words, an identity system.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.050
And let me stress once again
that the time scale on which

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.030
we displayed the impulse
response is an expanded time

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:55.320
scale in relation to the time
scale on which we displayed

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.820
the input and the output.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:04.090
OK, so we see that, in fact,
a first-order difference

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.370
equation is a filter.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.270
And, in fact, it's a very
important class of filters,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.320
and it's used very often to
do approximate lowpass and

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.570
highpass filtering.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:24.310
Now, in addition to the
convolution property, another

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.420
important property that we had
in continuous time, and that

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.500
we have in discrete time, is
the modulation property.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.080
The modulation property tells
us what happens in the

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.730
frequency domain when
you multiply

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.700
signals in the time domain.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.100
In continuous time, the
modulation property

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.760
corresponded to the statement
that if we multiply the time

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.400
domain, we convolve the Fourier
transforms in the

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.470
frequency domain.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:02.730
And in discrete time we have
very much the same kind of

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.060
relationship.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:11.090
The only real distinction
between these is that in the

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.160
discrete-time case, in carrying
out the convolution,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.870
it's an integration only
over a 2 pi interval.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:25.120
And what that corresponds to
is what's referred to as a

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.550
periodic convolution, as opposed
to the continuous-time

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:37.800
case where what we have is
a convolution that is an

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.050
aperiodic convolution.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.930
So, again, we have a convolution
property in

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.680
discrete time that is very
much like the convolution

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.060
property in continuous time.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.570
The only real difference is
that here we're convolving

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.300
periodic functions.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.050
And so it's a periodic
convolution which involves an

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.510
integration only over a 2 pi
interval, rather than an

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.570
integration from minus infinity
to plus infinity.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:14.650
Well, let's take a look at an
example of the modulation

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:20.070
property, which will then lead
to one particular application,

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.110
and a very useful application,
of the modulation property in

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.180
discrete time.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:31.580
The example that I want to pick
is an example in which we

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.590
consider modulating
a signal with--

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.150
a signal with another signal,
x of n, or x1 of n as I

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.170
indicated here, which
is minus 1 to the n.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:48.050
Essentially what that says is
that any signal which I

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.640
modulate with this in effect
corresponds to taking the

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.110
original signal and then going
through that signal

00:32:56.110 --> 00:33:00.690
alternating the algebraic
signs.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.200
Now we--

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.430
in applying the modulation
property, of course, what we

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.390
need to do is develop
the Fourier

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.410
transform of this signal.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.820
This signal which I rewrite--

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.450
I can write either as minus 1
to the n or rewrite as e to

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:22.520
the j pi n since e to the j
pi is equal to minus 1--

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.210
is a periodic signal.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.700
And it's the periodic signal
that I show here.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.860
And recall that to get the
Fourier transform of a

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:39.020
periodic signal, one way to do
it is to generate the Fourier

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.360
series coefficients for the
periodic signal, and then

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.450
identify the Fourier transform
as an impulse train where the

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.900
heights of the impulses in
the impulse train are

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.510
proportional, with a
proportionality factor of 2

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:58.200
pi, proportional to the Fourier
series coefficients.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.380
So let's first work out what the
Fourier series is and for

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.580
this example, in fact,
it's fairly easy.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.886
Here is the general
synthesis equation

00:34:08.886 --> 00:34:12.429
for the Fourier series.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:18.969
And if we take our particular
example where, if we look back

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:25.130
at the curve above, what we
recognize is that the period

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.139
is equal to 2, namely it
repeats after 2 points.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:34.389
Then capital N is equal to 2,
and so we can just write this

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:36.389
out with the two terms.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:40.900
And the two terms involved are
x1 of n is a0, the 0-th

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:46.520
coefficient, that's with k
equals 0, and a1, and this is

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.719
with k equals 1, and
we substituted in

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.520
capital N equal to 2.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.290
All right, well, we can do a
little bit of algebra here,

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:58.800
obviously cross off
the factors of 2.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:04.370
And what we recognize, if we
compare this expression with

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.840
the original signal which is e
to the j pi n, then we can

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.780
simply identify the fact that
a0, the 0-th coefficient is 0,

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.510
that's the DC term.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.760
And the coefficient
a1 is equal to 1.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.160
So we've done it simply by
essentially inspecting the

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.950
Fourier series synthesis
equation.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:35.380
OK, now, if we want to get the
Fourier transform for this, we

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:40.470
take those coefficients and
essentially generate an

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:46.830
impulse train where we choose
as values for the impulses 2

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.680
pi times the Fourier series
coefficients.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.010
So, the Fourier series
coefficients are a0 is equal

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.630
to 0 and a1 is equal to 1.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:03.370
So, notice that in the plot that
I've shown here of the

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:09.460
Fourier transform of x1 of n, we
have the 0-th coefficient,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.320
which happens to be 0, and so
I have it indicated, an

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.440
impulse there.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:23.360
We have the coefficient a1, and
the coefficient a1 occurs

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.540
at a frequency which is omega
0, and omega 0 in fact is

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:33.100
equal to pi because the signal
is e to the j pi n.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.730
Well, what's this impulse
over here?

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.150
Well, that impulse is a--

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.940
corresponds to the
Fourier series

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.560
coefficient a sub minus 1.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.300
And, of course, if we drew
this out over a longer

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.850
frequency axis, we would see
lots of other impulses because

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.900
of the fact that the Fourier
transform periodically repeats

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.660
or, equivalently, the Fourier
series coefficients

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.790
periodically repeat.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:08.580
So this is the coefficient a0,
This is the coefficient a1

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.180
with a factor of 2 pi,
this is 2 pi times a0

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.680
and 2 pi times a1.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.260
And then this is simply an
indication that it's

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.510
periodically repeated.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:24.670
All right.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.830
Now, let's consider what happens
if we take a signal

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:34.470
and multiply it, modulate
it, by minus 1 to the n.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.540
Well in the frequency domain
that corresponds to a

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.800
convolution.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.820
Let's consider a signal x2
of n which has a Fourier

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.300
transform as I've
indicated here.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.460
Then the Fourier transform of
the product of x1 of n and x2

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.270
of n is the convolution
of these two spectra.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:01.850
And recall that if you could
convolve something with an

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.800
impulse train, as this is, that
simply corresponds to

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.920
taking the something and placing
it at the positions of

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.830
each of the impulses.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:17.850
So, in fact, the result of the
convolution of this with this

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:23.320
would then be the spectrum that
I indicate here, namely

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.920
this spectrum shifted up to pi
and of course to minus pi.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:34.550
And then of course to not only
pi but 3 pi and 5 pi, et

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.180
cetera, et cetera.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:42.020
And so this spectrum, finally,
corresponds to the Fourier

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:48.010
transform of minus 1 to the n
times x2 of n where x2 of n is

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:53.780
the sequence whose spectrum
was X2 of omega.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.750
OK, now, this is in fact an
important, useful, and

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.570
interesting point.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.210
What it says is if I have a
signal with a certain spectrum

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.230
and if I modulate--

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.180
multiply--

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.130
that signal by minus 1 to the
n, meaning that I alternate

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:14.470
the signs, then it takes
the low frequencies--

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.160
in effect, it shifts
the spectrum by pi.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.120
So it takes the low frequencies
and moves them up

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.470
to high frequencies, and will
incidentally take the high

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:26.440
frequencies and move them
to low frequencies.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.400
So in fact we, in essence,
saw this when we took--

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.920
or when I talked about the
example of a sequence which

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.120
was a to the n times u of n.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.730
Notice--

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.670
let me draw your attention to
the fact that when a is

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:46.460
positive, we have this sequence
and its Fourier

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:52.220
transform is as I show
on the right.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:40:00.820
For a negative, the sequence is
identical to a positive but

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.030
with alternating sines.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.730
And the Fourier transform of
that you can now see, and

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:12.900
verify also algebraically if
you'd like, is identical to

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.640
this spectrum, simply
shifted by pi.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.280
So it says in fact that
multiplying that impulse

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.530
response, or if we think of a
positive and a negative, that

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.260
is algebraically similar to
multiplying the impulse

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.650
response by minus 1 to the n.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.150
And in the frequency domain,
the effect of that,

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:38.250
essentially, is shifting
the spectrum by pi.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.440
And we can interpret that
in the context of

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.060
the modulation property.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:50.260
Now it's interesting that what
that says is that if we have a

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:58.070
system which corresponds to a
lowpass filter, as I indicate

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:03.320
here, with an impulse
response h of n.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.530
And it can be any approximation
to a lowpass

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.860
filter and even an ideal
lowpass filter.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.900
If we want to convert that to
a highpass filter, we can do

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.980
that by generating a new system
whose impulse response

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:24.010
is minus 1 to the n times the
impulse response of the

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.490
lowpass filter.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:31.920
And this modulation by minus
1 to the n will take the

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.980
frequency response of this
system and shift it by pi so

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.500
that what's going on here at low
frequencies will now go on

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.750
here at high frequencies.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:53.010
This also says, incidentally,
that if we look at an ideal

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:58.610
lowpass filter and an ideal
highpass filter, and we choose

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.270
the cutoff frequencies for
comparison, or the bandwidth

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.650
of the filter to be equal.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:10.190
Since this ideal highpass filter
is this ideal lowpass

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:16.580
filter with the frequency
response shifted by pi, the

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.640
modulation property tells us
that in the time domain, what

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:25.520
that corresponds to is an
impulse response multiplied by

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.950
minus 1 to the n.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:32.500
So it says that the impulse
response of the highpass

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.230
filter, or equivalently the
inverse Fourier transform of

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.720
the highpass filter frequency
response, is minus 1 to the n

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.780
times the impulse response
for the lowpass filter.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.860
That all follows from the
modulation property.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.710
Now there's another way, an
interesting and useful way,

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:57.200
that modulation can be used to
implement or convert from

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.710
lowpass filtering to
highpass filtering.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.300
The modulation property tells us
about multiplying the time

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.170
domain is shifting in the
frequency domain.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:09.810
And in the example that we
happened to pick said if you

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:14.120
multiply or modulate by minus
1 to the n, that takes low

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.580
frequencies and shifts them
to high frequencies.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:23.280
What that tells us, as a
practical and useful notion,

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.520
is the following.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.540
Suppose we have a system that
we know is a lowpass filter,

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.410
and it's a good lowpass
filter.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.800
How might we use it as
a highpass filter?

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.080
Well, one way to do it, instead
of shifting its

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.810
frequency response, is to take
the original signal, shift its

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.080
low frequencies to high
frequencies and its high

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.500
frequencies to low frequencies
by multiplying the input

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.160
signal, the original signal, by
minus 1 to the n, process

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.070
that with a lowpass filter where
now what's sitting at

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.430
the low frequencies were
the high frequencies.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:05.320
And then unscramble it all at
the output so that we put the

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.760
frequencies back where
they belong.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.060
And I summarize that here.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.860
Let's suppose, for example, that
this system was a lowpass

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.840
filter, and so it
lowpass-filters

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.120
whatever comes into it.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.560
Down below, I indicate taking
the input and first

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.830
interchanging the high and low
frequencies through modulation

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:32.460
with minus 1 to the n.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.220
Doing the lowpass filtering,
which--

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.660
and what's sitting at the low
frequencies here were the high

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.990
frequencies of this signal.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.830
And then after the lowpass
filtering, moving the

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:46.860
frequencies back where they
belong by again modulating

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.560
with minus 1 to the n.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:56.150
And that, in fact, turns out to
be a very useful notion for

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:01.240
applying a fixed lowpass
filter to do highpass

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.550
filtering and vice versa.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:15.470
OK, now, what we've seen and
what we've talked about are

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:20.740
the Fourier representation for
discrete-time signals, and

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.080
prior to that, continuous-time
signals.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.250
And we've seen some very
important similarities and

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.470
differences.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:34.660
And what I'd like to do is
conclude this lecture by

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.910
summarizing those various
relationships kind of all in

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.550
one package, and in fact drawing
your attention to both

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:46.250
the similarities and differences
and comparisons

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.930
between them.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:54.710
Well, let's begin this summary
by first looking at the

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.240
continuous-time Fourier
series.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:02.280
In the continuous-time Fourier
series, we have a periodic

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.940
time function expanded as
a linear combination of

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.000
harmonically-related complex
exponentials.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.420
And there are an infinite
number of these that are

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.710
required to do the
decomposition.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.230
And we saw an analysis equation
which tells us how to

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:24.380
get these Fourier series
coefficients through an

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.330
integration on the original
time function.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:32.260
And notice in this that what
we have is a continuous

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.250
periodic time function.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:38.990
What we end up with in the
frequency domain is a sequence

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.670
of Fourier series coefficients
which in fact is an infinite

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:46.700
sequence, namely, requires all
values of k in general.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.650
We had then generalized that to
the continuous-time Fourier

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:57.750
transform, and, in effect, in
doing that what happened is

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:07.580
that the synthesis equation in
the Fourier series became an

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.830
integral relationship in
the Fourier transform.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:17.360
And we now have a
continuous-time function which

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.290
is no longer periodic, this was
for the aperiodic case,

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:25.080
represented as a linear
combination of infinitesimally

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.870
close-in-frequency complex
exponentials with complex

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:35.850
amplitudes given by X of omega
d omega divided by 2 pi.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.210
And we had of course the
corresponding analysis

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.360
equation that told us how
to get X of omega.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.060
Here we have a continuous-time
function which is aperiodic,

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:53.485
and a continuous function of
frequency which is aperiodic.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:01.780
The conceptual strategy in the
discrete-time case was very

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:08.640
similar, with some differences
resulting in the relationships

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.920
because of some inherent
differences between continuous

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.110
time and discrete time.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:19.560
We began with the discrete-time
Fourier series,

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:24.360
corresponding to representing a
periodic sequence through a

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.780
set of complex exponentials,
where now we only required a

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.990
finite number of these because
of the fact that, in fact,

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.830
there are only a finite number
of harmonically-related

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.580
complex exponentials.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.710
That's an inherent property
of discrete-time complex

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.070
exponentials.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:49.640
And so we have a discrete,
periodic time function.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.270
And we ended up with a set of
Fourier series coefficients,

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:56.670
which of course are discrete, as
Fourier series coefficients

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:01.960
are, and which periodically
repeat because of the fact

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.290
that the associated complex
exponentials

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.540
periodically repeat.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.030
We then used an argument similar
to the continuous-time

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.840
case for going from periodic
time functions to aperiodic

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.290
time functions.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:20.190
And we ended up with a
relationship describing a

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:25.710
representation for aperiodic
discrete-time signals in which

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:30.460
now the synthesis equation went
from a summation to an

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.620
integration, since the
frequencies are now

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.770
infinitesimally close, involving
frequencies only

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.500
over a 2 pi interval,
and for which the

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.800
amplitude factor X of omega--

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.140
well, the amplitude factor
is X of omega d omega

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.190
divided by 2 pi.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:51.060
And this term, X of omega,
which is the Fourier

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:57.120
transform, is given by this
summation, and of course

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.500
involves all of the
values of x of n.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:05.420
And so the important difference
between the

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.390
continuous-time and
discrete-time case kind of

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.460
arose, in part, out of the fact
that discrete time is

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.830
discrete time, continuous time
is continuous time, and the

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:18.770
fact that complex exponentials
are periodic in discrete time.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.910
The harmonically-related ones
periodically repeat whereas

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.470
they don't in continuous time.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:28.830
Now this, among other things,
has an important consequence

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:30.270
for duality.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:34.540
And let's go back again and look
at this equation, this

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.660
pair of equations.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.800
And clearly there is no duality

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.040
between these two equations.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.230
This involves a summation, this
involves an integration.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:50.810
And so, in fact, if we make
reference to duality, there

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.810
isn't duality in the

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.900
continuous-time Fourier series.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.910
However, for the continuous-time
Fourier

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:03.910
transform, we're talking about
aperiodic time functions and

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.310
aperiodic frequency functions.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.350
And, in fact, when we look at
these two equations, we see

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.550
very definitely a duality.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:15.530
In other words, the time
function effectively is the

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.340
Fourier transform of the
Fourier transform.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.660
There's a little time reversal
in there, but basically that's

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.780
the result.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:26.890
And, in fact, we had exploited
that duality property when we

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:27.620
talked about the

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.020
continuous-time Fourier transform.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:40.370
With the discrete-time Fourier
series, we have a duality

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:44.590
indicated by the fact that we
have a periodic time function

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:48.910
and a sequence which
is periodic in

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.170
the frequency domain.

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:53.150
And in fact, if you look at
these two expressions, you see

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.200
the duality very clearly.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.630
And so it's the discrete-time
Fourier

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.630
series that has a duality.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:07.080
And finally the discrete-time
Fourier transform loses the

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.150
duality because of the fact,
among other things, that in

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:15.040
the time domain things are
inherently discrete whereas in

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.580
the frequency domain they're
inherently continuous.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.395
So, in fact, here there
is no duality.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:30.280
OK, now that says that there's
a difference in the duality,

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.510
continuous time and
discrete time.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:37.780
And there's one more very
important piece to the duality

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.610
relationships.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:44.400
And we can see that first
algebraically by comparing the

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.280
continuous-time Fourier
series and the

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.435
discrete-time Fourier transform.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.210
The continuous-time Fourier
series in the time domain is a

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:03.580
periodic continuous function, in
the frequency domain is an

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.930
aperiodic sequence.

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:13.680
In the discrete-time case, in
the time domain we have an

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:19.850
aperiodic sequence, and in the
frequency domain we have a

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:21.990
function of a continuous
variable

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:24.480
which we know is periodic.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.100
And so in fact we have,
in the time domain

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.370
here, aperiodic sequence.

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:32.300
In the frequency domain
we have a

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.990
continuous periodic function.

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:38.600
And in fact, if you look at the
relationship between these

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:48.390
two, then what we see in fact
is a duality between the

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:53.370
continuous-time Fourier
series and the

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.500
discrete-time Fourier transform.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.170
One way of thinking of that is
to kind of think, and this is

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.820
a little bit of a tongue twister
which you might want

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:08.240
to get straightened out slowly,
but the Fourier

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.000
transform in discrete time is a

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.270
periodic function of frequency.

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:17.190
That periodic function has a
Fourier series representation.

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.540
What is this Fourier series?

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.170
What are the Fourier series
coefficients of

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.730
that periodic function?

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:26.030
Well in fact, except for an
issue of time reversal, what

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:29.920
it is the original sequence
for which

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.670
that's the Fourier transform.

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:35.610
And that is the duality that I'm
trying to emphasize here.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.910
OK, well, so what we see is
that these four sets of

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:47.110
relationships all tie together
in a whole variety of ways.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:51.070
And we will be exploiting as
the discussion goes on the

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.690
inner-connections and
relationships

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:55.000
that I've talked about.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.730
Also, as we've talked about the
Fourier transform, both

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.750
continuous time and discrete
time, two important properties

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.570
that we focused on, among many
of the properties, are the

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.950
convolution property and the
modulation property.

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:14.670
We've also shown that the
convolution property leads to

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.020
a very important concept,
namely filtering.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.700
The modulation property leads
to an important concept,

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.380
namely modulation.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:31.200
We've also very briefly
indicated how these properties

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:35.000
and how these concepts have
practical implications.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.700
In the next several lectures,
we'll focus in more

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.100
specifically first on filtering,
and then on

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.570
modulation.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:49.000
And as we'll see the filtering
and modulation concepts form

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.750
really the cornerstone
of many, many

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.530
signal processing ideas.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:54.780
Thank you.

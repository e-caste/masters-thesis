00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.700
The formula that we just derived
for the monotonic case

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.290
has a nice intuitive explanation
that we will

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.770
develop now.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.320
Suppose that g is a monotonic
function of x and that it's

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.780
monotonically increasing.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.100
Let us fix a particular x and a
corresponding y so that the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.420
two of them are related as
follows-- y is equal to g of

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.750
x, or we could argue in terms
of the inverse function so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.200
that x is equal to h of y.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.610
Recall that h is the inverse
function, that given a value

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.880
of y, tells us which one is the
corresponding value of x.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.000
Now let us consider a small
interval in the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.950
vicinity of this x.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.960
Whenever x falls somewhere in
this range, then y is going to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.530
fall inside another
small interval.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.480
The event that x belongs here is
the same as the event that

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.310
y belongs there.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.590
So these two events have
the same probability.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.110
And we can, therefore, write
that the probability that Y

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:30.390
falls in this interval is the
same as the probability that X

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.350
falls in the corresponding
little interval on the x-axis.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.610
This interval has a certain
length delta 1.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.759
This interval has a certain
length delta 2.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.880
Now remember our interpretation
of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.229
probabilities of small intervals
in terms of PDFs so

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.620
this probability here is
approximately equal to the PDF

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.100
of Y evaluated at the point
y times the length of the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.560
corresponding interval.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.259
Similarly, on the other side,
the probability that X falls

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.050
on the interval is the
PDF of X times the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260
length of that interval.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.670
So this gives us already a
relation between the PDF of Y

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.350
and the PDF of X, but it
involves those two numbers

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.590
delta 1 and delta 2.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.690
How are these two
numbers related?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.670
If x moves up by the amount of
delta 1, how much is y going

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.780
to move up?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.640
It's going to move up by an
amount which is delta 1 times

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.030
the slope of the function g
at that particular point.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.500
So that gives us one relation
that delta 2 is approximately

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.890
equal to delta 1 times the
derivative of the function of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.710
g at that particular x.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.930
However, it's more useful to
work the other way, thinking

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.460
in terms of the inverse
function.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.200
The inverse function maps y to
x, and it maps y plus delta to

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.960
2 to x plus delta 1.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.390
When y advances by delta 2, x
is going to advance by an

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.990
amount which is how much y
advanced times the slope, or

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.060
the derivative, of
the function that

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.670
maps y's into x's.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.135
And this function is the
inverse function.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.940
So this is the relation that
we're going to use.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.480
And so we replace delta 1 by
this expression that we have

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.430
here in terms of delta 2.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.390
And now we cancel the delta
2 from both sides of this

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.140
equality, and we obtain the
final formula that the PDF of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:34.270
Y evaluated at a certain point
is equal to the PDF of x

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.240
evaluated at the corresponding
point, or we could write this

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.010
as the PDF of X evaluated at the
value x that's associated

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.930
to that y that's given by the
inverse function, times the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.565
derivative of the function
h, the inverse function.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.870
And this is just the same
formula as the one that we had

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.100
derived earlier using CDFs.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.470
This derivation is
quite intuitive.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.760
It associates probabilities of
small intervals on the x-axis

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.550
to probabilities of
corresponding small intervals

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.820
on the y-axis.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.150
These two probabilities have to
be equal, and this implies

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.180
a certain relation between
the two PDFs.

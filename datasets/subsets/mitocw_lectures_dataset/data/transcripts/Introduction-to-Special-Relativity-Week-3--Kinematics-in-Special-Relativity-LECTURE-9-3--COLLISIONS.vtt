00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:08.840
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.390
In this section we're
going to talk a bit more

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.780
about collisions.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.520
I've already seen collisions in
study of momentum conservation

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.930
in previous sections.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540
So here we can have a collision.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.790
Then we can describe them
in the center of mass frame,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.180
for example, where the total
momentum is equal to 0.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.580
So in the case of the
collision of two particles,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.040
the momentum of particle
one plus the momentum

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.320
of particle two is equal to 0.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.160
We can then describe the
energy and the momentum

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.330
of the particles before
and after the collision.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.910
In the lab frame, the
situation is different.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.070
Here typically we
have one particle

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.560
with some momentum hitting
another particle, which

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.910
is at rest.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.230
But we can also have
different types of collisions.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.970
We describe or characterize
elastic collisions

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.360
where the kinetic energy is
conserved and so is the mass.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.379
So you can think about two
billiard balls colliding

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.360
without any friction,
in which case

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.410
they don't change their
appearance, their mass.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.130
Everything is unchanged, so
you must change the direction.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.500
The total kinetic energy
in these collisions

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.600
are typically conserved.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.670
But we can also have
inelastic collisions.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.140
And there's two different kinds.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.290
There's sticky kinds, where
the mass after the collision

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.305
is greater.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:24.930
So you have two
particles, for example,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.850
maybe they stick together--
they're some, like,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.990
Play Dough balls--

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.890
and the kinetic energy after
the collision is smaller.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.390
Or you can have explosive
collisions, where

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.460
the mass afterwards is smaller.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.150
Maybe you start from
one heavy, big object

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.810
and then which explodes
into many smaller ones.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.480
But the kinetic energy after
the collisions is much smaller.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.240
Those are also collisions.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.930
So here we want
to do an activity

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.370
and study an
inelastic collision.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.620
So before we have two particles
there, or billiard balls.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.990
They're exactly the same
and have a velocity u.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.550
And after the collision their
mass is capital M, big mass.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550
And you're going to
describe this collision once

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.120
in the center of mass frame and
one in the laboratory frame.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.260
And so the question
now is, are the masses

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.233
and is energy conserved
in those collisions?

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:22.650
And you're going
to just described

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.965
this in both reference forms.

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:30.410
So again, stop the video here
and try to work this out.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.900
I already did this,
so I discussed

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.860
before, in those
collision problems

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.040
it's always important
to be really clear.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.760
The situation
before the collision

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.690
was A. The situation
after the collision was B.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.020
So I'm describing this here.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.530
First in the center of
mass frame where the x--

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.840
and I'm just talking
about x component here--

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.770
the x momentum is 0, which
is equal to the mass times u

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.220
times gamma minus the
mass times u terms gamma.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.550
That's the 0.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.320
The energy before is 2 times
the mass times gamma times

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.500
c squared.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.860
After the collision,
the particle is at rest.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.440
The new one
particular is at rest

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.050
and has an energy,
large M over--

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.015
times c squared.

00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:19.120
In the laboratory frame
situations, different case.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.740
X momentum 0 minus
m times u prime--

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.300
this is a different velocity--

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.440
times gamma of u prime.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.750
So here I'm trying to indicate
that this gamma is not

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.460
the same gamma as over here.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.940
This is a gamma, but it's
the velocity of u prime.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230
And the energy is the rest
mass of the particle addressed

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.680
plus the mass times
gamma times c squared off

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.690
the second particle.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.820
After the collision, the
particle has some velocity u.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.650
And so the momentum
in x direction

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.250
is minus large M times u
times gamma of u again.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.260
And the energy is large M
times gamma u times c squared.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.490
OK, good.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.980
So now we can use
momentum conservation

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.560
and find this equation here.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.590
And from which we
can then calculate

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.190
that the large mass is equal
to 2 times the smaller mass.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.720
So what you find, and this
is the relativistic math,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.840
you find that at the conclusion
that the rest mass is not

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.830
conserved.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.830
The mass of this big
ball is not simply

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.110
the mass of the two
rest masses, or 2 times

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.760
the mass of the rest mass.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.650
You have to consider
this gamma factor here.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.040
It's 2 times the relativistic
math, if you want.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.930
But you also find
that the total energy

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.120
is conserved in circulation so
that the sum of m0 gamma times

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.170
c squared is conserved
in the collision,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.180
irrespectively in how
you actually reference it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.860
when you discuss the problem.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.450
I want to close this
part of collisions

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.480
with a small
discussion of units.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.970
And that will become
interesting and important later

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.070
on when we look at
particle physics examples.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.740
So in particle
physics, we often talk

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.040
about units of electronvolt
in collision experiments,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.700
or mega electronvolts,
or kilo electronvolts,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.320
tera electronvolts.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.980
So 1 electronvolt is
the kinetic energy

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.010
of the particle with charge
e, which is accelerated

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.060
in a potential of 1 volts.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.480
So that corresponds--
that's a unit of energy

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.350
and it corresponds
to 1.6 times 10

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.583
to the minus 19
joules or 1.6 times 10

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:50.160
to the minus 90 kilograms
meter squared over 2nd square.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.120
But the mass of an electron
is really, really small.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.340
And those units
here are introduced

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.170
because the mass
is small and you

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.840
want to have reasonable
numbers to work with.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.110
So the mass of the
electron is 9.11 times

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.240
10 to the minus 31 kilogram.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.620
So if you just rewrite an m0 as
equal to m0 c squared times 1

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.170
over c squared you
find that, huh,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.460
now we rewrite this and find
that the masses 8 times 10

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.450
to the minus 14
joules over c squared.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.320
Or in units of
electronvolts, 5 times 10

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.600
to the 5 electronvolts
over c squared,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.670
which is 0.511 mega
electronvolts over c squared

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.950
or 511 kilo electrons
over c squared.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.640
So when we talk about
the mass of an electron,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.080
we sometimes approach this
with natural units, in which c

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.800
squared is equal to 1.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.270
And that just simply says
that the mass of an electron

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.870
is 511 kilo electronvolts.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.370
The math of a neuron
is mega electronvolts,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.860
and so on, and so on.

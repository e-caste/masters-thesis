00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.913
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:10.830
So we're going to continue
the discussion that

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.180
makes a case against ether when
discussing stellar aberration.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.920
So the problem we
have in mind here

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.470
is the ones where we
use a telescope to look

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.180
at a distant star.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.000
When we do this,
the fact of ether

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
might change the way we have
to orient our telescope.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.010
Let's have a look at this.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.369
So we are in a situation
that our hypothesis

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.140
is that the ether exists.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.930
This carries-- is the medium
in which light travels.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.690
But it's dragged with earth.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
So this is our case number one.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.780
In that situation, the
telescope looks at the star.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.860
The light of the star enters
our telescope at the top

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.680
and then tries to
go to the bottom.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.750
Because the medium in
which the light travels

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.980
and the telescope move with
the same velocity-- remember,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.020
the ether is dragged
with the earth--

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.440
the light appears to go
straight down the telescope.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.300
Without the--
[INAUDIBLE] case 2,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.140
without the ether being
dragged or even exist,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.090
we actually do have to
slightly tilt our telescope.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.920
Why?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.450
Because after the light hits
the top of our telescope,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.610
the telescope keeps
moving because it's

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.290
in a different reference frame.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
And therefore, we have to
have this slight tilting.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.280
The value of the tilt
is equal to velocity

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.270
of the Earth over C.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.160
This is a well-known effect in
astrophysics and, by the way,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.160
was already studied way earlier
by James Bradley in the 1720s.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.520
He actually developed the--

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.470
not really supported
theory of light

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.540
where he was talking about
particle nature of light.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.860
So his idea was very
similar to case 2,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.640
that the Earth is moving
in a different reference

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.139
frame with respect to
the star and the sun,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.910
moving around the sun.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.590
And therefore, the
tilting angle needs

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.800
to be the tangent of
the tilting and needs

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.260
to be equal to the distance
of Earth to the Sun.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.860
And the distance is [INAUDIBLE]
this angle is very, very small

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.770
because the nearest star
[INAUDIBLE] to Earth

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.750
is about four light years away.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.960
So with this now, we can again
do our ether versus particle

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.270
nature model comparison.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.250
So in our first discussion,
we concluded clearly

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.980
that the wave and ether
hypothesis dominates or wins.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.520
But now we have studied at
least two further experiments.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.060
So, again, I invite you
to stop here and think

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.660
about how stellar aberration
and Michelson-Morley would

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.530
be answers to the particle
model or wave model [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.630
explanation.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.090
As a thought experiment,
the Fizeau and Airy

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.820
experiment that we haven't
and did not discuss this here.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.320
All right.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.130
So for stellar aberration,
the particle model actually

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.580
seems to work, as it
was proposed apparently

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.260
to solve this very problem.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.080
And the Michelson-Morey
experiment

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.990
also is consistent with
the particle model.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.590
So now we're in this dilemma
that some experiments

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.870
or experimental
evidence for particle

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.630
ether nature and some for
the particle nature of light.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.830
So the question of how do we get
out of the dilemma-- and we'll

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.820
discuss this in [INAUDIBLE]
the next section.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.030
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.330
Our lesson, today, hopefully
will serve two purposes.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.270
On the one hand, we will give
a nice application of the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.940
chain rule.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.970
Now that we've had two units
devoted to working with the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.820
chain rule, I thought you might
enjoy seeing how it's

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.360
used in places which aren't
quite that obvious--

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.520
places that we wouldn't expect
to be used, at least.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.670
And secondly, I would like to
pick as my application one

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.520
which comes up in many, many
different contexts.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.750
And without further ado, the
topic I want to cover today is

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.950
called "Integrals Involving
Parameters".

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.430
Now, that sounds like
a big mouthful.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.000
Let me motivate that for you,
first of all, physically, and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.440
then in term of a couple
of geometric examples.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.500
You all know from past
experience my great ability

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.700
with physical applications, so
I won't even try to find

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.050
anything profound here.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.000
Let me just take a pseudo
example, pointing out what

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
type of situation we're trying
to deal with and leaving it to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.500
your own backgrounds to see
places where the same

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.210
principle could have been
applied, but hopefully in a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.400
more practical, meaningful
way for you.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
Imagine for example, that we
have a platform that we're

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.830
looking along in the
x direction.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.180
And we've punched holes in this
platform, say, and liquid

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.480
is trickling through these
various holes.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.360
The holes are all on a
horizontal line this way.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.870
What we're going to do is
we're going to focus our

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.020
attention on a particular
particle of the liquid, and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.510
we're going to watch
it as it falls.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.110
And what we would like to do is
find how far that particle

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.520
fell, say, during the first
second of its flight.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.350
Obviously, from a calculus point
of view, the first thing

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.610
we have to do is know what the
velocity function is, because

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.880
ultimately, we would like to
integrate the velocity.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.590
Now, notice that we would expect
the velocity to be

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.770
depending on time.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.360
If this were a freely falling
situation, we'd expect the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.980
usual gravitational
type situation.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.440
Or whatever the situation
happened to be, we would

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.780
expect on the one hand that
the velocity does

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.970
depend on of time.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.030
On the other hand, because of
how the streams are flowing--

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.770
in other words, we don't know
what's happening above here

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.760
that's causing the water to
shoot out-- we don't know what

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.670
the initial velocity is coming
out of each of these holes in

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.420
the sense that a different
opening may give rise to a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.010
different velocity of
stream coming out.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.790
All I'm trying to bring out
here is that as we try to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.470
focus our attention on a
particular opening, we find

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.950
that the velocity of the
particle that will follow it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.620
during that first second is a
function both of its position

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.420
x-- in other words, x sub 0 in
this case, because we're

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.700
focusing at x equals x0
and the time t as t

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.030
goes from 0 to 1.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.570
And we then simply integrate
along the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.040
vertical direction here.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.960
We find y as a function of x0
from 0 to 1-- v(x0, t) dt.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.340
Once we're through integrating,
you see, notice

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.610
that the integration is
with respect to t.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.400
So when we're through
integrating, this being a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.450
definite integral, t
no longer appears.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.690
We have a function of x0 alone,
saying nothing more

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.220
than the distance that the
particle falls during the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.630
first second is a function of
the position of the opening

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.610
along the line here.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.800
Now, at any rate, the practical
application is not

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.160
so much writing down this
equation as the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.690
inverse is the case.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.650
Namely, in many practical
applications, we are given

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.280
this particular integral.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.850
And for some reason or other,
want to determine

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.190
what v itself is.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.250
In other words, we often want
to find the derivative given

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.200
the integral.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.190
All right.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.649
Let's just let it go at that
for the time being.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.000
The important point is that I
want you to see an example of

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.530
an integral.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.530
Let me just write this here
in more abstract form.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.680
It appears to be a definite
integral, a to b.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.290
The function inside the
integrand is apparently a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.850
function of two variables,
x and y--

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.650
say, in this case x0 and t.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.730
One of the variables is a
variable of integration--

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.960
in this case, y--

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.640
and the other variable is being
treated as a constant.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.660
And that's where the word
parameter comes in. x is a

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.600
parameter, meaning a variable
constant, in the sense that,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.930
for this particular problem, x
is chosen to be in some domain

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.040
and remains fixed.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.040
In other words, this is some
function of x when we're all

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.970
through here.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.640
All right?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.930
As a geometric example, imagine

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.300
the following situation.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.030
We have a surface w = f(x,y).

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.710
We take the plane x = x0 and
intersect this surface with

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.150
that particular plane.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.770
We get a curve, you see.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.450
Now, we look at that curve
corresponding to two points, p

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.990
and q, where p and q are
determined by the y

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.640
values a and b.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.990
In other words, p corresponds
to y = a.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.100
q corresponds to y = b.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.800
And now, a very natural question
that might come up is

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.380
that we would like to find the
area of this particular plane

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.520
region, in other words,
the area of this slice

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.985
between p and q.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.830
Now, you know, the first thing
I hope that you'll notice is

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.950
that because this shape of the
surface can be in many

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.490
different ways, the particular
cross section that we get does

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.690
depend on the choice of x0.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.320
Different slices--

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.630
different planes x = x0 will
give us different curves of

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.520
intersection.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.930
The point is that once we have
the curve intersection x is

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.730
being treated as
the parameter.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.130
This particular curve is
given by what equation?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.780
f is a function of x0 and y.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.730
See, x = x0 for every
point on this curve.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.090
And so the area of the region R
is the integral from a to b,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.420
f(x0, y) dy.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.950
And the question that very often
comes up is, how do you

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.180
find the derivative of A sub R
with respect to x0, noticing,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.940
you see, that A sub R is a
function of x0 alone, the y

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.070
dropping out between the limits
a and b when we perform

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.270
the operation of integration.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.890
A third place that this type
of situation occurs is in

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.100
solving certain differential
equations.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.220
For example, suppose we're given
a particular curve and

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.460
that that curve determines a
region R between the lines x =

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.820
a and x = b.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.830
Suppose all we know about
the curve is its

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.170
slope at any point.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.330
We know that its slope at any
point is given by dy/dx and

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.500
some function of x and y which
we don't necessarily have to

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.550
go into right now.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.470
And let's suppose, for the
sake of argument, that we

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.060
solve this first order
differential equation.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.840
What we'll find, if we're
lucky, is that y is some

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.900
function of x and an
arbitrary constant.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.090
Remember, once you have one
solution to a differential

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.760
equation, you have an infinite
family in terms of a one

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.370
parameter solution to a
differential equation.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.850
In other words, in finding the
area of the region R in this

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.690
case, there are many curves that
satisfy this particular

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.770
differential equation.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.820
Until we know what specific
points are being referred to

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.510
over here, the best we know
for sure is what?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.420
That these endpoints are a and
b, that the integrand is

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.650
f(x,c), and we're integrating
that with respect

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.130
to x from a to b.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.630
I freudianly put a c in here,
because I think what I was

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.420
trying to emphasize for you is
that when you look at this

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.320
thing, observe that
this integral is a

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.870
function of c alone.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.490
Namely, when you integrate this
thing, you integrate it

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.280
with respect to x.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.120
The x drops out.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.740
All you have left here is a c.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.570
A sub R, then, is
a function of c.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.090
And in many cases, what we would
like to do is see how

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.320
fast the area changes
as a function of c.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.700
In other words, how do we change
the area as a function

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.740
of changing the arbitrary
constant c?

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.410
And I have enough exercises in
the assignment to give you

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.950
concrete drill on this.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.910
All I'm trying to give you here
is an overview of the

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.960
entire topic.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.350
And the reason I want to give
you this overview is that it's

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.929
hinted at in the textbook,
but this topic

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:38.940
is not covered there.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.870
In fact, the reason that I had
you read that particular

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.920
section of the textbook before
the lecture this time-- you

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.700
notice that usually we start
with the lecture.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.640
This time I had you read the
textbook first, because the

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.080
way the textbook covered this
topic is essentially nothing

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.430
more than the way we
tackled a different

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.040
problem last semester.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.910
And I want you to see that the
problem done in the Thomas

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.620
text is not a new problem--

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.380
it's one that we've
done before--

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.500
but that with the tools that
we now have available, we

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.740
could've tackled a more
significant problem.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.770
And that's the one I'm electing
to do here and what I

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.890
want to show you the key
steps on, because

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.140
they're not in the text.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.900
But I will leave the

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.230
reinforcement for the exercise.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.790
At any rate, hopefully now, when
you see an integral of

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.300
this type, it will not
bother you too much.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.320
In other words don't worry about
how do you integrate a

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.060
function of two independent
variables?

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.700
When you see something like
this, it means that there is

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.930
some implicitly implied
domain for x.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.800
In other words, we have
some function of x.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.010
Let's say the domain of g might
very well be, say, all

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.380
x's between two values,
say c and d.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.840
But who cares about
that right now?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.390
The important point is that
g is defined on a certain

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.410
set of values x.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.870
And what it says is to compute
the output of the g machine.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.470
For the given x, you fix that
x and integrate f(x,y) dy

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.880
between a and b.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.020
Notice, you see, during the
integration, x is being

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.430
treated as a constant, so that
for all intents and purposes,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.680
this is an ordinary integral.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.780
But because x isn't a bona fide
constant, meaning what?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.080
It's a constant only in the
sense that once chosen, it

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.180
remains fixed for this
particular integration.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.540
Different values of
x will give me

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.030
different integrals here.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.910
And consequently a very natural
question that comes up

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.710
is how does my function g--
which depends on x--

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.130
how does that vary
as x varies?

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.160
In other words, the key question
is simply this.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.060
First of all, given g defined
this way, one, does g prime

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.120
even exist?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.260
Does dg/dx exist?

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.620
And two, if it does
exist, what is it?

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.840
In other words, the question
that we're raising is if we

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.570
can find g prime of x, how do
we do it in terms of looking

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.440
at the right hand side?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.900
And let me not try to guess
the answer here.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.940
The answer does turn out to be,
in this particular case,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.470
one that you might
have guessed.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.890
But I prefer to show you
that we don't have to

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.500
guess, point one.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.620
Point two, if you do
guess, you won't

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.610
always be that lucky.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.680
That's my finale for
today's lecture.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.760
But let me see if I
can survive to get

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.140
to the finale first.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.510
Let me see how we'll tackle
a problem like this.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.220
First of all, to see if g prime
exists at some value x0,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.140
what we have to do is--

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.520
way back to the very beginning
of Part 1--

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.930
the same old definition for
an ordinary derivative.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.200
We have to compute the limit of
g of x sub 0 plus h minus

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.880
g(x sub 0) over h, taking the
limit as h approaches 0.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.960
Notice what the g
machine does...

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.230
What the g machine does is it
feeds x into the integrand

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.960
here and integrates this with
respect to y from a to b.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.670
So if the input of my g machine
is x0 plus h, that

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.360
means that the x is replaced
by x0 plus h here. g of x0

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.210
plus h is simply integral
from a to b f of x0

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.140
plus h comma y dy.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.700
Similarly, g(x0) is integral
from a to b f(x0, y) dy.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.080
I now want to form
this difference.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.190
And noticing--

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.820
again, this is all calculus
of a single variable--

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.470
that the difference of two
definite integrals is the

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.670
definite integral of the
difference, I can conclude

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.320
that g(x0 + h) minus g(x0)
is simply this single

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.990
integral over here.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.060
Now, my next step in determining
g prime of x0 is I

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.030
must divide this by h.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.990
Notice, by the way, that h is
an arbitrary increment, but

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.240
once chosen, remains fixed.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.210
Notice that h is a constant
as far as this

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.880
integration is concerned.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.050
Consequently, to divide by h, it
is permissible to bring the

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.990
h inside the integrand.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.250
In other words, technically
speaking, the h should be

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.750
here, but since h is a constant
with respect to y,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.000
the integral can have
the h brought in.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.080
Why do I want to bring
the h in here?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.910
Let me again telegraph what
I'm leading up to.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.310
Obviously, when I'm going to
compute g prime, my next step

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.000
is to take the limit of this
as h approaches 0.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.230
With h in here, I look at this
and what I hope is that by

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.960
this amount of time at least the
following minimum amount

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.960
of material has rubbed off on
you in a second nature way--

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.050
that if I look at this
expression in brackets as h

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.250
approaches 0, this is precisely
the definition of

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:45.110
what we mean by the partial of
f(x, y) with respect to x

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.600
evaluated at (x0, y).

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.460
See, this is what?

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.500
The change in f-- see,
y is held constant.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.110
We're taking this over to change
from x0 to x0 plus h

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.150
and dividing by h.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.760
This is a partial of f
with respect to x.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.900
That's why I want to
bring the h inside.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.780
So now, I say, OK,
g prime of x0, by

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.540
definition, is this limit.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.255
I now want to take the limit
of this expression.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.010
And by the way, notice what I'd
love to do now is to jump

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.885
right in here and say, aha, this
is just the partial of f

00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:21.310
with respect to x evaluated
at (x0, y0).

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.510
But the thing I would
like you to notice--

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.700
and again, going back to Part
1 of course, one of the big

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.420
things that we talked about
under the heading of uniform

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.310
convergence.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.060
There is a very dangerous
thing in general to

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.190
interchange the order of
limit and integration.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.110
This says what?

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.580
First perform the integration,
and then take the limit.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.860
What we would like to be able to
do is first take the limit

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.030
and then integrate the result.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.500
Now, we did see that, provided
the integrand was continuous,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.330
these operations were
permissible.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.150
But we'll talk about that
a little later.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.120
For the time being, let's simply
summarize by saying if

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.660
the limit operation and the
integration operation can be

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.720
interchanged, then
the derivative--

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.630
see, this thing here is what?

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.500
This is my g(x).

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.640
The derivative of g(x) with
respect to x has the very

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.080
delightful form that,
essentially, all I have to do

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.340
is take the derivative
operation, come inside the

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.500
integrand, and replace the
derivative with respect to x

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.380
by the partial derivative
with respect to x.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.220
In other words, the derivative
of the integral from a to b,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.890
f(x, y) dy is the integral from
a to b, the partial of f

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.250
with respect to x dy--

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.480
provided, of course, that the
limit and the integration are

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.510
interchangeable.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.820
In particular, this will be true
if f and f sub x exist

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.590
and are continuous and see,
straighten out the range and

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.830
the domain and what have
you once and for all.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.860
Notice that y is allowed to
exist between a and b.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.690
We've said that x is going
to exist on some domain

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.040
between c and d.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.090
Notice that saying that y is
between a and b and x is

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.410
between c and d geometrically
says that f is

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.570
defined on a rectangle.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.320
See?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.970
OK.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.270
And then what we're saying is,
under these conditions, to

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.620
integrate an integral with a
parameter, with respect to

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.360
that parameter, all we have to
do is come inside the integral

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.980
sign and differentiate--

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.220
take the partial derivative--

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.190
with respect to what is being
used as the parameter.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.540
In this case, it's x, which
is the parameter.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.880
Now, the only danger with this
particular thing-- and by the

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.040
way, notice, not only is there
a danger here that I'm going

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.380
to mention.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.260
The danger is this looks so
easy, you may be saying, why

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.250
did he do it the hard way?

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.840
Why didn't he just tell
us this was the right

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.050
way of doing it?

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.840
And the point is it just happens
to be one of those

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.460
coincidences where the rigorous
way yields a logical

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.240
answer which is consistent
with what is probably our

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.230
intuitive guess.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.940
But it's not always going
to happen that way.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.545
And the example that I have in
mind now goes back to what we

00:16:55.545 --> 00:16:57.180
were talking about the beginning
of the lecture.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.300
Namely, I wanted to give
you an application

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.360
of the chain rule.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.810
And here's where that
application comes in.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.319
I now call this--

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.130
I don't know what to call it.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.540
So let's just call it variable
limits of integration.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.480
Same problem as before--

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.540
it's going to cause the chain
rule to come in now.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.490
The only difference
is going to be--

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.680
and that's just a forewarning.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.650
You don't have to know
that right now.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.240
I'm going to have the same
problem as before.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.130
What did I have before?

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.280
I had that g(x) was integral
f(x, y) dy between the two

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.050
constants a and b.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.760
Now, I'm going to let my
constants of integration also

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.240
depend on the parameter.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.300
See, all the constants of
integration have to be our

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.540
constants as far as
y is concerned.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.080
What I'm saying is what makes
this problem differ from the

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.030
previous one is suppose that
it happens that instead of

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.950
being given a nice rectangle to
play around with, I'm given

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.520
a couple of curves like
this in the xy plane.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.360
See, this would be a of x.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.860
This would be y equals b(x).

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.610
See, what I'm saying now is
that not only does the

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.220
integrand depend on what value
of x I pick, but the limits of

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.200
integration as I'm finding a
cross-sectional area of a

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.180
surface, you see.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.990
The limits of the integral
themselves depend on the

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.250
choice of x--

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.820
constant, as far as y is
concerned, but depend on x.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.250
You see, now, what happens is
that my parameter appears in

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.670
the limits as well as just
in the integrand.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.430
And now, you see, also what
this means is if I try the

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.510
previous approach of computing
g(x plus delta x), et cetera,

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.710
I'm in trouble, because the
only way I can combine two

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.930
integrals and put them under the
same integral sign is if

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.470
they're between the same
limits of integration.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.460
Notice here, for example, that
if I replace x by x plus delta

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.080
x, I not only change the
integrand, but notice that the

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.590
limits become what?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:54.330
a of x plus delta x, b(x plus
delta x)-- and those in

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.680
general, unless a and b happen
to be constants,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.420
will vary with x.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.180
In fact, let's look
at it this way.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.000
This is the problem we should
have started with in the sense

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.840
that constant limits of
integration are a

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.640
special case of this.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.880
At any rate, what I wanted
to show you was that this

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.100
particular problem can be
handled very nicely in terms

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.390
of the chain rule.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.900
Namely, what we do here is we
observe that, first of all, y

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.510
is not really a variable here.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.310
It's integrated out.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.240
So what we think of is let's
think of x as being some

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.330
variable u.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.000
Let's think of b(x) as being
some variable v. Let's write

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.400
down the function of
three independent

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.590
variables u, v, and x.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.840
OK.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.240
What will that function be?

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.100
Let u, v, and x be arbitrary,
independent variables.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.460
Look at the integral from
u to v f(x, y) dy.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.210
This is obviously dependent
upon u.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.780
It's dependent upon v. And
it's dependent upon x.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.340
The place that the chain rule
comes in is that in our

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.810
particular problem, u and v
cannot be arbitrary, but

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.900
rather u must be that particular
function a(x), and

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.030
v must be the particular
function b(x).

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.480
Consequently g(x)
is simply what?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.720
It's h(u, v, x), where u
is a(x) and v is b(x).

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.450
Consequently, to find g prime of
x, what we want is h prime

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.240
of x and to find h prime
as a function of x.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.410
See the chain rule here?

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.540
u can be expressed
in terms of x.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.430
v can be expressed
in terms of x.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.180
Obviously, x is already
expressed in terms of x.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.380
So this is really implicitly
a function of x alone.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.300
So by the chain rule, what I'd
like to be able to do is to

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.530
combine these three pieces
of information to

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.410
find h prime of x.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.810
And remember how the
chain rule works.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.320
Now, I'm not going to
beat that to death.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.970
We've just had two
units on that.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.290
Let's just say it
rather quickly.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.780
g prime of x is the partial of
h with respect to u times u

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.140
prime of x plus the partial of h
with respectively to v times

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.030
v prime of x times the partial
of h with respect to x times x

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.790
prime of x, which, of
course, is just 1.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.020
In other words, writing this
thing out, g prime of x is

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.730
simply this.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.870
What is the partial of
h with respect to u?

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.590
Let's come back here for a
second and remember what h is.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.790
h is this integral.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.610
I want to take the partial of
that with respect to u.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.950
That means I have to
investigate this.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.450
Now, here's the interesting
point.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.210
Whereas u, v, and x are
independent variables, what

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.280
does it mean when you say you're
taking the partial with

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.350
respect to u?

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.650
It means that you're treating
v and x as constants.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.370
Now, if v and x are being
treated as constants, what I

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.530
have is simply what?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.920
I'm taking a derivative with
respect to a variable where

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.100
the only place the variable
appears is as the lower limit

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.410
of the integrand.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.730
In other words, I claim that
that's nothing more

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.460
than minus f(x, u).

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.570
Then I go inside
the integrand.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.620
In other words, I differentiate
the integral.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.530
That leaves me just
the integrand--

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:05.350
and replace the variable
by the variable of

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.580
integration u here.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.250
And because it's the
lower limit, I put

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:08.960
in the minus sign.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.280
Now, why did I go through
that very fast?

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.840
That's why I had you read
this assignment first.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.300
Notice that the assignment in
the textbook does not touch

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.390
what I'm talking about, but
rather seems to review that

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.790
topic that we covered
under Part 1--

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.050
that if you wanted to take an
ordinary derivative with

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:31.480
respect to u, integral from u
to a, g(y) dy, the answer

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.950
would just be minus g(u).

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.770
And that's exactly what
I did in here.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.200
I treated v and x as
constants here.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.100
In other words, the only
variable in here was u.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.380
That will be emphasized again
in the exercises.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.700
In a similar way, the partial
of h with respect to v means

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.920
this thing.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.020
Notice now that u is being
treated as a constant.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.070
x is being treated
as a constant.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.640
To differentiate this, my
variable appears only as an

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.410
upper limit on the integrand.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.810
That means I come inside the
integral sign, replace the

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.800
integral by just the function
itself, replacing what?

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.150
Replacing y--

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.740
that's the only variables
of integration--

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.450
by the upper limit v. In other
words, this is f(x, v).

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.030
All right?

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.770
And finally, the partial of h
with respect to x is this

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:26.970
integral here.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.470
Notice now that u and v are
being treated as constants.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.990
With u and v being treated as
constants, that's the special

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.070
case that we started out lecture
with, namely, to

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.230
differentiate with respect to a
parameter when the parameter

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.360
appears only as part
of the integrand.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.420
So how do we do that?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.900
We come inside.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.690
This is the interval from u to
v, the partial of f with

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.050
respect to x dy.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.190
Putting the whole
thing together--

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.760
recalling, among other things,
that du/dx, since u is a(x),

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.090
is just a prime of x and that
dv/dx is b prime of x-- what

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.440
this says--

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.940
and again, I want to see the
beauty of the chain rule here,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.610
because at least to my way of
thinking, I don't see anything

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.480
at all intuitive about the
result I'm going to show you.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.790
And that is as soon as you make
the limits of integration

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.930
variable, to differentiate
an integral involving a

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:19.450
parameter--

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.970
you see again, what's the
parameter here? x.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.070
We integrate it with
respect to y.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.550
This is a constant as far
as y is concerned.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.500
See, intuitively, you might say,
gee, all you've got to do

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.820
is take the derivative sign,
bring it inside, and this

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.450
should be the answer.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.920
See, it's the same
as we did before.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.510
The point is-- and this is where
many serious mistakes

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.010
are made in problems involving
integrals of this type--

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.750
is that the reason that our
intuitive way happened to be

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.790
right in the simpler case was
that these were constants with

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.890
respect to x.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:52.930
Now, they're variables.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.810
Well, it turns out, if you just
wrote this thing down,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.900
you would be wrong.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.510
What is the correction factor?

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.380
Again, come back to here.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.760
The correction factor is this
here, which we've just started

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.030
to compute.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.600
Again, just saying it--

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.640
if you wrote this term down to
get the correct answer, you

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.180
would have to tack on what?

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.810
b prime of x times f(x, b(x)).

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.270
That means what?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.790
You think of a y as
being over here.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.685
For the particular value of
x, you replace y by b(x).

00:25:24.685 --> 00:25:27.140
In other words, you look at f(x,
y), and every place you

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.130
see a y, replace it by b(x).

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.490
And then subtract that
from that a prime of

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.910
x times f(x, a(x)).

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.280
Now again, I suspect that, for
many of you, it's the first

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.800
time that you've seen something
like this, because I

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.850
say it's a topic which I believe
was a natural one to

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.560
occur in the textbook, but
for some reason it

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.830
doesn't appear there.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.470
Because of the importance of
the concept, the number of

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.190
times it appears in physical
applications, the number of

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.480
times that one has to
differentiate with respect to

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.270
an integral--

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.190
I don't know the physical
applications well enough to

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.410
lecture on them, but it does
occur in probability theory,

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.660
among other places, it appears
in any subject involving

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.040
integral equations
and the like--

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.610
that I wanted to give you the
experience of seeing what the

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.960
concept means, to have
you hear me say it.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.320
And then I will spend the
exercises trying to drive home

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.180
the computational know how so
that you will be able to do

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.280
these things at least in a
mechanical way, independently

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.800
of whether the theory made that
much sense because of the

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.380
lack of physical example
motivation other than what I

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.410
did at the beginning.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.880
At any rate, keep in mind,
though, that in terms of our

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.740
present topic, where we're
talking about the chain rule,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.500
this is a certainly noble
application to show an

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.530
important place in the physical
world where knowledge

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.340
of the chain rule plays
a very important role.

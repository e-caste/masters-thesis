00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.820
In this video, we will consider
a classical application

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.250
of Markov chains, which has to
do with the design of a phone

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.020
system.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.620
This is a classical problem,
which was posed, analyzed,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.420
and solved by a Danish
engineer by the name of Erlang.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.040
It was more than 100
years ago when phones just

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.150
started to exist,
but the technique

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.780
remains relevant today to design
systems of a similar nature.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.440
As for Erlang, he was
trying to figure out

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.800
how to design the capacity
of a phone system.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.920
That is, how many
lines should we

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.230
set up for a group of
people, say, in a village,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.000
to be able to communicate
to the outside world?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.210
So here is a cartoon
of the problem, where

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.070
these are the
phone lines, and we

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.250
need to decide how many of these
lines to set up, let's say,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.890
B. How to do that?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.890
Well, we don't want B to be too
large, much more than needed,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.780
because too many lines
would be expensive.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.640
On the other hand, we
want to have enough lines

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840
so that if a reasonable
number of people place phone

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.030
calls during the
same period, they

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.190
will be able to talk and
not get busy signals.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.750
So if B is 10 and 15 people
want to talk at the same time,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.020
then 5 would get a
busy signal, and that's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.590
probably not what you want as
an acceptable level of service.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.930
So we would like B to be just
large enough so that there

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.500
is a high probability
that no one is

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.910
going to get a busy signal.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.700
So how do we go about modeling
a situation like this?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.200
Well, we need two
pieces of information,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.830
one describing how
phone calls get

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.729
initiated, and once a phone call
gets started, how long does it

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.700
take until it ends?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.170
We're going to make some very
simple but somewhat plausible

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.700
assumptions.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.630
We will assume that phone calls
originate as a Poisson process.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.190
We will assume that
out of that population,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.824
there is no coordination.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:12.270
At completely random times,
people pick up their phone

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.200
independent of each other's.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.390
Also, there is nothing special
about the various times,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.900
and different times
are independent.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.230
So a Poisson model
is a reasonable way

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.480
of modeling a situation
under these assumptions.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.140
We also assume that
the rate lambda

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.800
is known or has been estimated.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.079
Now, it might be the case
that during the night,

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.540
the rate would be different
than during the day.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.520
In that case, you
would design the system

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.730
to meet the largest
rate of the two.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.660
For the phone calls
themselves, we

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.460
are going to assume that
the duration of a phone call

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.460
is a random variable that has
an exponential distribution

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.950
with a certain parameter mu.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.540
So 1/mu is the mean
duration of a phone call.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.150
Duration of phone calls are
independent between each other.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.860
So here, again, we assume
that the parameter mu

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.880
has been estimated.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.990
For example, the mean duration
1/mu could be 3 minutes.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, is the exponential
assumption a good assumption?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.730
So here is the PDF of an
exponential random variable

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.030
with parameter 1 over three.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.250
That means that the mean
duration is about three minutes

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.210
here.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.160
So if you look at
this PDF, it means

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.260
that most phone calls
will be kind of short.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.620
There is going to be a
fraction of phone calls

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.120
that are going to
be larger, and then

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.829
a very small fraction
of phone calls

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.460
that are going to
be even larger.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.510
So it sounds reasonable.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.930
However, it's not exactly
realistic in some situations.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.590
Typically, phone calls that
last a very short time are not

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.425
that common as opposed to what
an exponential distribution

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:55.650
would indicate here.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.740
So some other distribution
might be better, like this one,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.190
for example, here, where during
a very small period of time

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.660
the wait corresponding to
this very short period of time

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.020
are kind of small as well.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.830
There are many
distributions of this type.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.790
I've just provided here
one simple example.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.560
This one is the Erlang
of parameter 2 and 2/3.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.200
What it means is that
it is the sum of two

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.930
independent exponential
random variables,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.880
and each one of them
of parameter 2/3.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.630
So the mean duration associated
with this distribution

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.130
is also 3 minutes.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.600
So this might fit better
some practical situation.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.210
But here we will keep the
simple assumption associated

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.080
with an exponential
distribution.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.580
All right.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.825
So let's try now to
come up with the models

00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:54.670
that we can decide how many
lines, B, do we want to set up.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.600
The Poisson process
run in continuous time.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.270
And call durations being
exponential random variables

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.700
are also continuous
random variables.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.250
So it seems that we are in
a continuous time universe.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.360
Here is a cartoon of the
evolution of the system.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.380
So here I have in blue when
phone calls get initiated.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.650
So this is called 1, a second
one, a third, a fourth,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.230
and a fifth one.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.530
And also, I have represented
here the duration of the call.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.140
So call 1 lasted that
long, call 2 lasted long

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.690
until here, 3 up to
here, 4 here, et cetera.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.510
So when you look at this
kind of system in that way,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.409
and you run through time
in a continuous manner,

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.145
and here you have 0 line busy.

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:49.250
You have 1 line used, 0,
1, then 2 becomes busy,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.640
3, 2, 1, and 0, and
so on and so forth.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.220
Also note that if I look at
that system at any time t,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.540
because of our assumptions
of a Poisson process

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.780
and an exponential
duration for phone calls,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.390
and a memoryless
property associated

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.330
with these processes, it
means that the past really

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.280
has no information
about the future.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.150
And so, in some sense, the
Markov property is valid.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.920
So it looks like a
continuous time Markov

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.210
process would be needed here.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.180
And this is indeed an
option, but we have not

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.950
studied those in this class.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.290
So we will discretize
time instead

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.480
and work with a Markov chain.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.470
We are discretizing time in the
familiar way, the way we did it

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.050
when we studied the
Poisson process.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.450
We are going to
take the time axis

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.700
and split it into
little discrete time

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.450
slots, each of duration delta.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.770
And delta is supposed to be
a very, very small number.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.000
So now under this
discretization,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.790
by the definition of
the Poisson process

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.410
the probability that we'll
see 1 arrival during any time

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.530
slots of duration delta
will be lambda times delta.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.420
Also, if at any time, like here
we have 1 simple call active,

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.130
the probability that this call
will end during any future time

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.880
slot of duration delta
is mu delta, like here.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.860
Indeed, as we have
seen in Unit 9,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.050
an exponential
random variable can

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.890
be thought of as
representing the time

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.280
until the first arrival of a
Poisson process with rate mu.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.810
What if you have i busy
calls at the same time?

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.980
Then the probability
of having 1 call ending

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.200
in a time slot of duration
delta will be i mu delta.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.330
Like, for example here, this one
could correspond to something

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.840
as 2 mu delta.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.230
Indeed, each of the Poisson
processes associated

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.730
with these calls
with rate mu can

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.020
be combined into a merged
Poisson process of rate i times

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.810
mu.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.580
And a call completion will
correspond to the time

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.230
until the first arrival of
this merged Poisson process.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.140
For example, if I go back here
in my situation here at time t,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.840
there were still 3
phone calls active.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.840
And I represent here the
call number 2, call number 3,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.789
and call number 4 and
their remaining duration.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.960
And if you look at these
and you combine these 3

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.710
associated Poisson
processes into 1,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.070
you get a merged
Poisson process.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.970
And if you look now at the time
arrival of the first event,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.530
which would
correspond to here, it

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.630
would be an exponential
random variable.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.320
The duration here
would correspond

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.920
to an exponential random
variable of parameter 3 mu.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.010
So in that case, if you go back
to that representation here,

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.510
the probability of
a departure would

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.731
be 3 times mu times delta.

00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:04.230
OK?

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.750
So let us continue
with our discrete time

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.760
approximation of our system.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.360
Again, we have the village,
and the lines, the B

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.810
that we would like to decide.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.020
We have discretized
the time steps.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.200
We have made some approximation.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.480
And we know that during any
of these time slots here,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.490
the probability that
you would get a new call

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.600
is about lambda times delta.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.840
Lambda is the rate of
the Poisson process.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.020
And given that you have
i calls, the probability

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.990
that one of these calls ends
will be i times mu times delta.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.490
OK.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.420
If we want to propose a Markov
chain model for this system,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.140
we need to specify the
states and the transition

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.730
probabilities.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.250
What are the states
of the system?

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.040
If you look at the system
at any particular time,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.140
the minimum relevant
information to collect

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.490
would be the number
of busy lines,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.540
something like these 2 lines are
busy, or all of them are busy,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.090
or none of them are used.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.590
Now, because of our assumptions,
again, about the Poisson

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.040
process arrivals and
exponential duration

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.200
of calls and their
memoryless property,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.950
that information is
enough to fully describe

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.130
the state of our
system in such a way

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.450
that we get a Markov chain.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:26.290
So the states are numbers
from 0 to B. 0 corresponds

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.350
to a state in which all
the phone lines are free.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.280
No one is talking.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.930
B corresponds to a case where
all the phone lines are busy.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.660
And then you've got
states in between.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.850
Now, let us look at the
transition probabilities.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.800
Suppose that right now,
you are in that state.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.530
What can happen next?

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.740
Well, a new phone call
gets placed, in which case

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.300
the state moves up by 1.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.340
Or an existing call
terminates, in which case

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.190
the state goes down by 1.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.930
Or none of the two
happens, in which case

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.090
the state stays the same.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.990
Well, it is also possible that
a phone call gets terminated,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.510
and a new phone call gets
placed in the same time period.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.430
But when the duration
of the time slots

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.240
are very, very small,
the delta here,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.180
this event is going to have
a negligible probability,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.800
order of delta squared.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.500
So we ignore it, as
we ignore the fact

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.160
that more than one
new call can happen,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.710
or more than one call can be
terminated during a given slot.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.470
So what is the probability
of an upward transition?

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.610
That's the probability that the
Poisson process has an arrival

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.900
during the slots
of duration delta.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.850
And as we have seen, this
is lambda times delta.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.860
So each one of these
upward transitions

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.430
has the same probability
of lambda times delta.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.520
How about phone
call terminations?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.000
If we have i phone calls
that are currently active,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.480
the probability that one of them
terminates becomes i mu delta.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.140
So here it would be mu
delta, and here B mu delta.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.390
Now, let us analyze this chain.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.630
It has the birth and
death form that we

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.710
discussed in the
previous lecture.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.560
So instead of writing
down the balance equation

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.850
in a general form,
we think in terms

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.980
of frequency of transitions
across some particular cut

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.760
in this diagram, so
for example here.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.970
The frequency with which
transition of this kind

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.190
happen or are observed
has to be the same

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.740
as the frequency of
transition of this kind.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.290
The frequency of
transition of this type

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:52.060
will be, if you look at pi i
here and pi of i minus 1 here,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:13:01.910
this transition here will happen
with pi i times i mu delta.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.510
And the transition
of this type here

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:13.620
will be pi i minus 1
times lambda times delta.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.230
And the frequency
of these transitions

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.400
have to be the same as the
frequency of these transitions,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.520
so we have that equals that.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.770
And then we can cancel
the delta in both,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.230
and we are left with
this equation here.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:38.340
So this equation expresses pi of
i in terms of pi of i minus 1.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.900
So if we knew pi of 0, then
we can calculate pi of 1,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.960
and then in turn calculate pi
of 2, and so on and so forth.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.330
And the general formula
that comes out of this,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.020
after some algebra, is
given by this expression,

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.200
which involves pi of 0.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.860
Now, what is pi 0?

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.715
Well, we can find it by using
the normalization equation,

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:10.620
the summation of pi i equals 1.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.680
You use this normalization,
replace each pi

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.790
i by their quantities
as a function of pi 0,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:23.000
and then we obtain
this equation for pi 0.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.450
So here, again, we use
that normalization.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.090
We replaced pi i by their value.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.610
We sum to 1, and
we obtain pi of 0.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.070
And then in turn,
from this pi of 0,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.430
you can replace the
pi of 0 in pi of i,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:45.230
and you obtain a pi of i as a
function of B, lambda, and mu.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:49.180
So if we know B
and lambda and mu,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.660
we can set up this Markov chain,
and we can calculate pi 0,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.410
and then pi of i for all i's.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.775
We can then answer a
question like this.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:04.120
After the chain has
run for a long time,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.380
how likely is it that at
any given random time,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.740
you will find the system
with i busy lines?

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.950
Well, it will be pi of i.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.010
And also, we can interpret
the steady-state probabilities

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.360
as frequencies.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.520
So once I found pi of
i, it also tells me

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.770
what fraction of the time
I will have i busy lines.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.710
And you can answer that
question for every possible i.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.770
Now, we were initially
interested in the probability

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.160
that the entire system is
busy at any point in time,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.350
in other words, in
that state here.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.160
So if a new phone
call gets placed,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.390
it is going to find the
system in a random state.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.830
That random state is
described in steady-state

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.270
by the probability pi's.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.020
And the probability that
the entire system is busy

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.270
is going to be given by pi of
B, and this is the probability

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.740
that we would like to be small
in a well-engineered system.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.900
So again, given lambda,
mu, the design question

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.040
is to find B so that this
probability is small.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.190
Could we figure out a
good value for B by doing

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.760
a back-of-the-envelope
calculation?

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:27.630
Well, let's suppose that
lambda is 30 calls per minute.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.180
And let's assume
that mu is 1/3 so

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.350
that the mean
duration is 3 minutes.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.870
So on average, a call
lasts for 3 minutes,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.440
and you get 30 calls
on average per minute.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.390
Then how many calls would
be active on the average?

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.590
If a call lasted exactly
1 minute, then at any time

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.500
you would have 30
calls being active.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.270
Now, a call lasts, on the
average, for 3 minutes.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.562
So by thinking in
terms of averages,

00:16:56.562 --> 00:16:58.020
you would expect
that, at any time,

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:05.490
there would be about 90 calls
that are active, 3 times 30.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.180
And if 90 calls are
active on the average,

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:14.720
you could say, OK, I'm going
to set up my B to be 90.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.420
But that's not very good,
because if the average number

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.480
of phone calls that want to
happen is, on the average, 90,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.740
sometimes you are
going to have 85,

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.319
and sometimes you'll get 95.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.830
And to be sure that the
phone calls will go through,

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.630
you probably want
to choose your B

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.100
to be a number a
little larger than 90.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.030
How much larger than 90?

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.820
Well, this is a question that
you can answer numerically.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.550
By looking at these
formulas, if you

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.210
decide that your acceptable
level of service, pi of B,

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.190
has to be less than
1%, then you will

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:58.820
find that the B that you need
to design is to be at least 106.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.720
So you actually need some margin
to protect against a situation

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.990
if suddenly, by
chance, more people

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.910
want to talk than
on an average day.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.950
And if you want to
have a good guarantee

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.830
that an incoming person will
have a very small probability

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.690
of finding a busy
system, here 1%,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.840
then you will need
about 106 phone lines.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.950
So that's the calculation
and the argument

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.730
that Erlang went
through a long time ago.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.600
It's actually interesting that
Erlang did this calculation

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.994
before Markov chains
were invented.

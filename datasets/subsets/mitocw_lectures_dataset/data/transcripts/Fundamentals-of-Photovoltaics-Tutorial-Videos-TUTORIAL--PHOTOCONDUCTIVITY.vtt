00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.230
PROFESSOR: Hello, everyone.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.890
In our last demo,
we demonstrated

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.050
how the electrical
conductivity of silicon

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.930
can be changed by over
six orders of magnitude

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.950
by adding dopants
that can increase

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.250
the number of free or mobile
charges in the material.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.990
Today, we'll show how we can use
light to break electronic bonds

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.510
and silicon, and create
free mobile charges.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.410
The principles
we'll be using today

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.250
can be applied to
everything from sun screen,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.280
to of course, solar cells.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.960
We'll use the undoped, or
intrinsic silicon sample

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.867
from our last demo, and measure
how the conductivity changes

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:52.950
when we shine light on it.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.850
Our set up is identical
to that of last time.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.470
We'll take a piece of
silicon with metal contacts.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.280
We'll use an ohmmeter that we
connect to our sample via metal

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.930
wires to measure
its conductivity.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020
The measured resistance
will be determined

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.580
by the conductivity and the
size and shape of our sample.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.400
Finally, we represent
the connectivity

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.770
in terms of our measured
values and relate it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.640
to the number of
free, mobile charges,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.260
and the material
properties of silicon.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.380
We'll first measure the
conductivity of our sample

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.910
in the dark, and then
shine light on our sample

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.280
and see how the
conductivity changes.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.070
Our ohmmeter is hooked
up to our sample,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.620
and we measure a resistance
of around 120,000 ohms, which

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.750
is equivalent to a conductivity
of around 0.0002 inverse ohm

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.402
centimeters.

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:44.610
Now, let's flip on the light.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.690
We can see that we measure
a slightly lower resistance

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.420
of around 40,000 ohms,
but what is light

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.240
doing to affect the
conductivity so much.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.090
Let's zoom in to the atomic
level and explore why.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.240
We see here a 2D representation
of a pure silicon crystal where

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.080
all the valence electrons
form rigid covalent bonds,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.420
are immobile, and don't allow
the flow of electricity.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.270
This material
structure is identical

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.700
to our intrinsic sample
when in the dark,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.390
which has a very
low conductivity.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.450
When light hits our sample,
photons of sufficient energy

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.940
can break these covalent bonds,
injecting the formally immobile

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.890
electron, giving enough
energy to move around.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.274
The mobile electron leaves
behind a mobile hole,

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:32.690
which can move
through the crystal

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.030
by swapping positions with
neighboring covalently bonded

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.670
electrons.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.780
This explains why
the light increases

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.390
the conductivity of our sample.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.240
Again, our conductivity
is determined primarily

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.890
by the number of mobile charges.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910
Light creates additional
pairs of mobile electrons,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.380
and holes, thus increasing
n and our conductivity.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.530
We've demonstrated that
light is able to generate

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.330
fee carriers in our
ultra-pure sample.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.310
The same effect still
happens in dope silicon,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.550
but the light induced
change in conductivity

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.700
only creates a small
relative change

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.430
that we can't measure
using our ohm meter.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.530
Generating these
extra mobile charges

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.660
by breaking covalent
bonds with light

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.220
is the source of the
electricity that we eventually

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.670
collect in our solar cell.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.360
In the next video, we'll explain
how these light generated

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.650
mobile charges will be collected
and converted into electricity.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.040
I'm Joe Sullivan,
thanks for watching.

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:23.710
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: The key
point of the previous lecture

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.740
was to simplify the
equations for refraction

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.060
from a spherical surface,
such that we can write them

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.050
in a simple form.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.430
OK, what I just
said was redundancy.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.258
But we want to simplify them.

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:44.050
I should have said we
want to simplify them

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.380
so that we can write them
in a linearlized form.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.600
And the linearlized form
is actually very useful

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.800
because with this form,
as I'm about to show,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.000
we're going to use a very
familiar form of math, namely

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.010
linear algebra matrices.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.430
And we can retrace
through almost arbitrarily

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.410
complex optical systems.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.030
Of course, there's a downside
that if write trace this way,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.320
we do not really get
very accurate results.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.640
Our results, as we
discussed last time,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.890
are only accurate within
the paraxial approximation.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.780
On the other hand, if we do this
analysis even approximately,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.870
we can get an idea of how
the optical system behaves.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.630
And then if we get this
approximate design,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.360
this approximate idea,
then we can plug the system

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.080
into a more sophisticated
numerical tool,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.260
for example, Zemax
or CODE V. There's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.770
a number of different
optical design

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.350
and software suites available.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.700
And then we can actually
get a more accurate analysis

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.070
of how the optical
systems would behave.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.741
So the other reason we
write these matrices

00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:08.199
is that they give
us actually quite

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.389
a bit of information
about the basic properties

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.630
of optical systems.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.610
So it is really worthwhile to
do this first, every time we

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.800
face an optics
problem, before we jump

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.590
into the numerical analysis.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.110
And for those of you who really
have a real-life problems

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.400
to solve and you really
need to go to software,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.470
we will tell you
later during the class

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.950
where we'll give you some
information about what

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.470
types of software are available
and what you can do with those.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.250
But generally, this idea
of using paraxial optics

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.990
is very powerful in order to
understand optical system.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.700
So the summary then of what
paraxial optics standard is

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.280
summarized.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.100
These are shown on
this slide over here.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.960
The most important
is the results

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.020
on the right that allows you
to write the angle of departure

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.240
of a ray to the right-hand
side of the card interface

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.550
and the elevation of
the ray, with respect

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.223
to the right-hand
side interface.

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:14.890
It allows you to write
them as functions

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.340
of the corresponding quantities
on the left-hand side

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.620
of the interface.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.340
And as you can see
there, it actually

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.060
looks like it two by two
set of vectors, which are

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.880
related by a two by two matrix.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.810
And the matrix are
not very interesting.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.190
As you can see, the most
relevant, the most interesting

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.520
element is the element on
the first row, second column,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.690
which equals the
index of refraction

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.190
to the right of the interface,
minus the index of refraction

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.390
to the left, divided by
the radius of curvature

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.315
of the spherical interface.

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:56.940
And, of course, the
radius of curvature

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.440
is simply the radius
of the sphere.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.540
We're talking about the sphere.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.730
And then the other result
that we put here and looks

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.360
like a propagation
through free space, it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.185
looks kind of too much trouble,
really, for what it's worth.

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:11.560
But you will see in a second
that this is actually a very

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.720
useful tool to have in mind.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.380
One of the thing that says is
that the ray, as it propagates

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.360
from the left over a
distance d, if it propagates

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.470
through free space,
then what happens

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.910
is the elevation
of the ray changes,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.290
but the angle of
propagation does not change.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.900
So this verifies what we
know from Fermat's principle

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.060
that a ray propagating
in uniform space,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.670
it minimizes its path.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.560
Therefore, it must
propagate in a straight line

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.080
because the straight line is
the minimum path between two

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.650
points.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.310
Now, you might be wondering.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.200
We talked last time about
ellipsoidal surfaces,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.460
hyperboloid surfaces,
and spherical surfaces.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.500
You might wonder, why
did we do this analysis

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.090
in the context of the sphere?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.650
Well, that says it doesn't
matter very much because all

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.370
of these three
possibilities, ellipsoids,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.180
hyperboloids, and
spheres, near the axis,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.540
they actually all
look kind of the same.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.810
If you compare a sphere--

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.180
so I should specify now
what I mean by axis.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.030
So in the case of a sphere, as
Professor Sheppard pointed out

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.690
last time, in the
case of a sphere,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.770
really, any lines going through
the center of the sphere

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.210
acts as the optical axis.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.200
But for the hyperboloid and
the ellipsoid, that's not true.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.100
There's a very well-defined
major axis and minor axis

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.680
for the surfaces.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.670
And it turns out you can match
the curvature of these surfaces

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.950
with the curvature of a
sphere so that [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.750
a common axis, they
all look the same,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.900
as I've done in this diagram.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.220
It's a little bit
of an algebraic mess

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.390
to actually work
out how to do this.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.930
So I didn't do it in this slide.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.390
The idea is basically to do
a Taylor series expansion

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.410
on the explanations that
describe all those surfaces.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.590
And then when you do
that, each one of those

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.803
is described by a different
set of coefficients.

00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:19.220
So what you can
do then is you can

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.440
match the coefficients in
order to match the curvature.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.460
So I will let the graduate
version of the class, those

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.380
of you who are taking
2710, as a homework,

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.140
I will let you work
out one of these,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.230
a simple case for matching--

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.160
I forget.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
I think it is matching
an ellipsoid to a sphere.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.590
So let you do that.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.390
What I really want you to
live with out of this lecture,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.860
for now, is that the
paraxial analysis remains

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.570
valid for all three surfaces.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.070
OK?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.920
As long as we
match the curvature

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.720
of the sphere, ellipse,
and hyperboloid,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.300
and we constrain ourselves
to the paraxial regime,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.030
then our results remain
approximately correct.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.180
So this is kind of
another useful property

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.760
of the paraxial
approximation that it is not

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.400
only valid for a
sphere, but it is also

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.120
valid for other
surfaces of revolution,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.940
provided the curvature near
the center of the surfaces

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.560
matches the curvature of
the corresponding sphere.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.070
OK.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.890
Yeah?

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.890
Push the button, please.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.100
Yeah, so that's a good question.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.290
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat the question?

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.457
We didn't hear the question.

00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:37.590
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
The question

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.630
was if there's an
angle that we'll

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.120
consider as a cutoff
for the breakdown

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.150
of the paraxial approximation.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.380
So the accurate answer is zero.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.270
Any angle other
than zero violates

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.250
the paraxial approximation.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.460
In actuality, you can calculate,
with the help from this Taylor

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.830
series, actually, that we
saw in the previous slide,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.990
you can calculate the
accuracy of the approximation.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.440
So treat it as a first order
of a Taylor series expansion.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.810
And then you can calculate what
is the next order accuracy.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.130
So this is actually
algebraically quite complex.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.080
And typically, we
resort to software

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.720
to do it for us,
numerical software.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.910
As a rule of thumb, anything
in the range below 30 degrees,

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.280
you can kind of trust the
paraxial approximation.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.420
But that's a rule of thumb.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.280
In some cases, it's not true.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.440
In some cases, you
need more accuracy.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.750
So the guideline is
something like that.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.380
But, for example,
for sure, if you

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.059
have a ray propagating
at 80 degrees,

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.940
you know for sure that
approximation breaks.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.420
If it goes to 1 to 3 degrees,
then most likely, you're OK.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.420
And then there's a
gray area that you

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.600
have to be a little
bit more careful.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.520
If the accuracy demanded
by the application

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.210
is much higher, than you
have to be more careful.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.040
There's also surfaces that are
not very well-described by this

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.950
at all, for example, a cubic.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.690
If you make a
refractive interface

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.532
that looks like a cubic surface,
would look kind of like this.

00:09:10.532 --> 00:09:12.240
And then this totally
breaks down, right?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:21.710
So you have to go to then to
non-paraxial [? methods. ?]

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:29.470
Another thing to discuss is
in one the previous equations,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.780
I wrote down ray
elevations and ray angles.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.580
But I was not very
careful about defining

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.320
the signs of these
angles, namely,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.660
whether they go up, or down,
or left, or right, and so on.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.070
I was deliberately left
this little bit vague.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.650
Again, this may appear like
too much trouble for nothing.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.770
But you will see, as we go
later on with the lecture

00:09:53.770 --> 00:10:03.080
today, you will see that this
is a very useful and highly

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.020
nontrivial aspect of
geometrical optics,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.720
namely, the conventions
of the signs,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.710
for when the quantities
that we're dealing with

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.840
are positive or negative.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.170
So bear with me
for a second, and I

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.680
will show examples of
how this works later.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.270
So I want to read this because
I don't know of a better way

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.770
to do it.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.470
I will read it.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.100
And then as I read, please
look down at the slide.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.060
And you will see on
the left-hand side

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.212
I have examples of all these
qualities being positive.

00:10:33.212 --> 00:10:34.670
And on the right-hand
side, we have

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.860
example of all of these
quantities being negative.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.580
OK, so the convention number
one is that the light always

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.300
travels from left to right.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.760
So you know immediately when
someone draws an optical system

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.590
or attempts to draw
an optical system,

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.030
you know immediately if this
person knows their optics

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.780
or not by the way they
pick the light propagation.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.637
If they show light rays
going from right to left,

00:10:56.637 --> 00:10:57.970
it means they don't know optics.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.767
So if they learned optics, they
learned it very deficiently.

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:01.600
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLES]

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.725
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So
always light goes from left

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:05.455
to right in this diagram.

00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:06.830
There's one
exception, of course.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.760
Can anybody guess?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.730
One exception that I'm
not dealing with here.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.540
Mirror.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.902
Push the button.

00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:13.610
AUDIENCE: Mirror.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.570
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Mirrors, yes.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.090
So in this diagram over here,
I do not consider mirrors yet.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.330
We will deal with mirrors
later, in about a week.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.600
And then we'll see a revised
set of sign convention.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.630
But as long as there's no
mirrors in your optical system,

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.500
if you have what is called a
purely dioptric optical system,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.700
then the light is always
going from left to right.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.920
Taking this as a
given, then we'll

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.440
define the positive and
negative radii of curvature

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.140
as solved over here.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.140
So if the surface is
convex towards the left,

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.640
then we'll call it positive, OK?

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.920
Then this sounds a
little bit weird.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.780
It says that
longitudinal distances

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.168
are positive if
pointing to the right.

00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:01.710
I'll show you an
example a little bit

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.310
later where distance can
become negative by pointing

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.210
to the left.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.910
But for now, take this
definition for granted.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.680
The same is for
lateral distances

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.590
that this measures perpendicular
to the optical axis.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.590
If they point up, then
they're called positive.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.250
If they point down,
they're called negative.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.210
And finally, angles
are positive if they

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.830
are acute in the
counterclockwise sense,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.950
with respect to
the optical axis.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.930
So clockwise, we have to be
very careful when we define it,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.850
so we don't get
any mirror effects.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.970
So hope that the cameras
that we're using here

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.810
do not make any mirrors.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.340
But counter-clockwise is
basically like this, OK?

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.190
If in this direction
you get an acute angle,

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.460
then the angle is positive.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.820
If you have to go all the
way around to get your angle,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.980
or another way to put
it is if you can make

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.400
it acute by going
clockwise, then you

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.610
call the angle negative.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.110
OK.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.560
So this set of conventions is
self-contained and consistent.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.900
To add to the confusion,
set and optical text books,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.790
they use the opposite
sign of conventions.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.250
It is also possible, by the way.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.900
The set of
conventions I use here

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.120
is consistent with
a Hecht text book

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.310
and the majority of text books.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.990
There's a minority
of textbooks that use

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.370
the exact opposite conventions.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.650
But we will not deal with those.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.900
OK, using these
set of conventions,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.870
we can define the power
of an optical system

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:44.090
based on whether rays
that propagate outwards--

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.230
by outwards, I mean a
ray bundle that expands--

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.500
whether a surface,
a spherical surface,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.990
causes the expansion to
become slower or faster.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.010
If the surface causes the
expansion to become slower,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.740
as in the top diagram
over here, then

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.420
the surface is said to
have positive power.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.180
If the surface causes the
expansion to become faster--

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.930
that is, it takes
the expanding bundle

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.650
and spreads it
further outwards--

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.970
then the surface is said
to have negative power.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.520
So now, let me proceed to define
a specific optical system.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.430
And then we'll see more examples
of this thing happening.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.800
So the system I would like
to consider is a lens.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.380
And this is actually the
first example of a lens

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.510
that we see in the class.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.900
And I will take a very
special case with a lens

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.100
that we refer to as thin.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.260
What's a lens?

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.720
A lens is simply
a piece of glass

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.850
that has been shaped to have
spherical surfaces on one

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.440
or both sides.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.300
Typically both, but
we'll see examples

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.880
of lenses that are actually
flat on one surface

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.980
and curved on the other surface.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.230
So when we call the lens
thin, well, we call it thin.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.690
Consider an expanding
spherical wave that

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.550
propagates through the lens.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.300
And consider the
maximum angle that can

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.650
be subtended through the lens.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.950
In other words, angles
larger than this one

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.330
would actually miss the lens.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.610
So therefore, this alpha maximum
is sort of the biggest angle

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.010
that we have to worry about.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.740
Well, what does the
paraxial approximation say?

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.130
It says that this angle
has to be relatively small.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.270
So assume that
this is true, then.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.960
The lens also has a thickness.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.540
So this thickness, I denoted
as T in this diagram over here.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.240
So provided this
thickness, if we

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.720
do a little bit of
an analysis here,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:09.660
we can calculate this thickness
relative to the radius

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.670
of curvature of the sphere.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.720
And the angle phi that
is defined as shown,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.560
from the center of the
sphere relative to the edge

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.820
of the ray, that subtends the
maximum angle alpha maximum.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.570
OK?

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.630
So we can see the definition
phi for this angle

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.660
and the radius r.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.000
So if, given this
angle of arrival

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.020
is alpha maximum, if it is
true that the angle phi is also

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.720
very small, then we can
consider the lens to be thin.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.140
So we can basically pretend
that the space between these two

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.770
points on the lens, the
space between the entrance

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.580
to the optical axis and the
exit of the optical axis

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.140
through the lens, we
can neglect the space.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.440
This is what the thin
lens approximation says.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.290
That's very convenient because
we can now analyze the lens.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.140
As you can see, if I
neglect this space,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.220
then the ray elevation
before and after

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.089
the lens remains the same.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.180
And also can
neglect a refraction

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.286
that might happen
within the lens.

00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:23.869
So basically, we
have the system where

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:29.480
the ray arrives then is bent
in one step and then propagates

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.960
outwards at a slightly
different angle.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.440
So in order to analyze the
system, now, what I will do

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.360
is I will break it
into two components.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.350
One of them is the curved
surface on the left-hand side.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.610
And the second is the curved
surface on the right-hand side.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.060
OK.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.650
And now, for each
one of those, I

00:17:53.650 --> 00:18:00.190
can define an angle on the right
and then angle on the left,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.367
as I have done in the
simple [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:03.367 --> 00:18:04.450
of the refractive surface.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.340
Now, each one of those is
a simple refractive surface

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.340
interface that we
know how to deal

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.770
with from the previous lecture.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:12.880
And I can add equations.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.100
Remember the equation
for the refraction

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.830
from the spherical surface.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.940
I will add it here on my
pad, just to remember.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.080
So it goes like this.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.740
Hopefully, someone will notice
and they will project it.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:39.090
So n to the right, alpha to the
right, x to the right equals--

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.280
can anybody see?

00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:45.300
OK, we're having technical
difficulties here.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:45.967
Oh, there we go.

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:48.133
AUDIENCE: Can you lower the
piece of paper a little?

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:48.784
Yeah, got it.

00:18:48.784 --> 00:18:50.230
Yeah.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.520
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
So this equals 1, 0, 1.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.840
This is easy.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.530
And then we have apply our
mnemonic, minus n to the right,

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:06.350
minus n to the left, over
the radius of curvature,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.060
times the same
property for the left.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:16.700
And left alpha left, x left.

00:19:20.921 --> 00:19:23.028
OK.

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.570
Now, what we're have
to do is we have

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.450
to apply this rule successively
for the two interfaces.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:35.480
So here's the question that we
get for the second interface.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.410
So this case, n
to the right is 1

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:43.730
because to the right of
this interface, I have air.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.330
And n to the left is n because
to the left of this interface,

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.020
I have glass.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.660
OK.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.540
Now, what I will do is I
will apply the same rule.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.790
But I will now apply it
on the first interface.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.460
And if I do to the first
interface, I get this equation.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.600
Now, notice that
in the numerator

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.990
of the element in the
first row, second column,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.830
the quantities are reversed
because now n to the right

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.790
is the index of refraction of
glass, whereas n to the left

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.690
is the index of refraction
in air, that is 1.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.730
So therefore, I get this matrix.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.190
Now, what it can do, I can
cascade the two matrices

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:33.920
because I can substitute
the vector n over 1 x1 that

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.300
is on the top equation.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.235
I can substitute it from
the second equation.

00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:39.860
And if I do that, of
course, I will get

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.200
a cascade of the two matrices.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.990
And notice that
in the cascade, it

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.380
is very important to
remember that in the cascade,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.063
the matrix of the last element
to the right appears left.

00:20:53.063 --> 00:20:54.980
And that is very important
to remember and not

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.000
confuse because as you know,
matrix multiplication is not

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.230
commutative.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.270
If you mess up the
order of these matrices,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.340
you will get the
wrong result. So you

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.590
have to remember that
you start from the right.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.970
That is, you start from the
end of the optical system

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.350
where the rays
depart, and you start

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.530
cascading the matrices going
backwards towards the beginning

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.100
of the optical system.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.530
So this is what I've done here.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.090
I've put the matrix
corresponding

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.950
to the second interface.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.550
This matrix appears first.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.140
And the matrix corresponding
to the first interface

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.040
appears second.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.720
And then I cascade them.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.550
I do the matrix
multiplication, which

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.150
is a relatively
straightforward task to do.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.010
And I get the second,
the last equation

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.860
that appears on the slide.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.260
OK.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.378
Now, let's go ahead and
interpret this equation.

00:21:42.378 --> 00:21:43.170
It looks very nice.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.628
But let's see what
it really means.

00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:47.920
Also, before I move on, let
me notice one more thing.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.360
Notice that in the
vectors of the ray, angles

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.440
of the ray elevations, the index
of refraction has disappeared.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.760
It has not really disappeared.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.140
It is simply because the angles
alpha right and alpha left

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.370
are in air.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.560
And therefore, the index
of refraction is 1.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.950
That's why there's no index of
refraction in that location.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.450
OK.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.560
Let's look at this
equation again.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:21.700
The top quantity that appears
relatively complicated,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.420
it has a name.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.290
It is called 1 over
the focal length.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.210
Now, you might
wonder, why did they

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.680
call this the focal length?

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.750
I will justify that in a second.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.140
But if you believe me that
the focal length follows

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.500
from this equation,
then this equation

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.990
is known as the lens
maker's equation.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.260
And it is very useful
because it gives you

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.280
the focal length of the thin
lens as a function of the three

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.210
quantities that define the thin
lens, that radii of curvature

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:59.290
to the left and to the right
and the index of refraction

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.970
of the lens.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.600
And what I want to
emphasize, again,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.280
is that this equation
is valid if the lens is

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.020
surrounded by air.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.910
If the lens is surrounded by
another material, for example,

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.410
water, or oil or
something with index

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.350
of refraction different
than 1, then this equation

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.980
does not hold anymore.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.420
And as a bonus, in the next
homework, which has already

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.410
been posted, you will actually
derive the corrected equation

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.260
if the lens is immersed
in a material that

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.360
is different than air.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.910
But for now, this
equation is correct

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.740
because we put our lens in air.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.620
So therefore,
everything is fine.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.630
And this is a lens
maker formula.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.490
So then let me justify that
this quantity that appeared over

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:47.910
there and has units 1 over
distance, why on over distance?

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:53.760
Because this quantity has 1
over the radius of curvature

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.690
in the denominator.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.880
So therefore, it
is 1 over distance.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.490
So let me justify why
this quantity is actually

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.030
the focal length of the lens.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.850
So to do that, let me
consider a ray that

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.290
is arriving from infinity
horizontally at an elevation x1

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.060
with respect to
the optical axis.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:18.155
So this ray, I can retrace
through the system.

00:24:18.155 --> 00:24:20.030
Basically to retrace
through the system means

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.770
that I have to propagate
this ray by a distance z.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.810
And then I have to find out
what is the ray angle alpha

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.460
2 with respect to the optical
axis and the ray elevation x2,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.590
also with respect
to the optical axis,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.020
as function of this
propagation distance z.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.980
So now you can see why it
was convenient to define

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.020
the matrix for propagation
through free space.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.300
Because now, in
order to figure out

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:55.250
where this ray lands, what is
its elevation and propagation

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.150
angle, all I have
to do is cascade

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.330
the matrix that
describes the lens

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.520
with a matrix that describes
propagation through free space.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.890
And we have seen this matrix of
propagation through free space.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:13.390
It is simply 1, 0
in the first row.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.387
And then the distance
and 1 in the second row.

00:25:17.387 --> 00:25:19.720
And there's actually, if you
look back at your equation,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.710
it is distance divided by
the index of refraction.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.320
But, again, because we are
propagating in air here,

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.940
the index of refraction is 1.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.640
So we don't have to worry
about this at the moment.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.200
And because the free space
is following the lens,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.960
the matrix corresponding
to free space

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.190
will actually appear first
before the matrix corresponding

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.700
to the lens.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.910
So this is the cascade
[INAUDIBLE] correctly here.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.630
And we can solve this.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.900
And we could find that is given
by this equation over here.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.270
So what we observe now is
that if we set the propagation

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:02.910
distance to-- first of all, I
did this in the general case.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:11.000
So as the ray entrance angle, I
left a general symbol alpha 1.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.510
But I said already that the
ray is arriving horizontal.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.820
That means alpha 1 equals 0.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.990
So therefore, the
elevation of the ray,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.970
with respect to
the optical axis,

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.290
is given by this equation.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:35.420
It is simply x2 equals
x1, 1 minus z over f, OK?

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.460
And we can see very easily over
here that if z equals f then

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.090
x2 will equal to 0.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:49.120
So this means that if
I let the ray propagate

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.170
by a quantity equal to
this magical amount that

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.600
appeared in the lens
maker's formula, then

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.210
the ray will hit the axis.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.310
So the ray will land
on the optical axis.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.650
And moreover, we can
very easily verify

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.180
that this happens independently
of x1, because as you can see,

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.400
x1 is outside the
parenthesis here.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.950
If I set this quantity
to equal 0, then

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:19.440
independent of what x1
was, we will actually

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.590
get all of the rays to
go through the same point

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.130
of the optical axis.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.800
So this is a central focus.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.220
You can see that the ray
bundle that arrived parallel

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.400
from infinity actually
now comes to focus

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.810
at this location of the
optical axis because

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.710
of this simple equations
that we just described.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.890
And this property over
here justifies the name

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.030
focal length.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.200
It is the length at which
the rays come to focus.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.700
OK.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.250
The inverse of the focal
length, just on its own,

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:00.750
as a sort of standalone
quantity, has a name, also.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.570
It is called the optical power.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.570
And that is a little bit
confusing because in our minds,

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.870
usually, power is
measured in what?

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.780
Well, this power is
not the usual power

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.650
that we measure as
energy per time.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.570
It is a different power.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:24.320
And for historical reasons, we
use the same name in optics,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.400
but it is measured
in inverse meters.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.890
And the inverse
meters, they're also

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.800
known as diopters in optics.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.770
And they define
the optical power

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.300
as the inverse of
the focal length.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.190
So, for example,
if the focal length

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.890
is 1 meter, which is a
pretty long focal length,

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.150
you call it one diopter.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.900
If the focal length
is 10 centimeters,

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.690
it is actually 10 diopters.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.970
If it is 1 centimeter,
it is 100 diopters,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.770
and so on and so forth.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:01.860
Very often, people like
myself who are myopic--

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.950
is anybody in the class,
is any of your myopic?

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:10.030
Anybody use corrective lenses
because you have myopia?

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.520
OK.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.070
Do you know what is the
power of your prescription?

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.620
AUDIENCE: 0.75.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.620
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: 0.75,
you're pretty likely.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.943
You have very small correction.

00:29:18.943 --> 00:29:19.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:22.020
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: That's
a pretty small correction.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.910
Can you say it in
the microphone?

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:27.740
AUDIENCE: 0.75 in the one
eye and in the other, 1.25.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.070
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK, 0.25.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.200
Is it 0.25 or minus 0.25.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.490
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.25.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.320
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Minus 1.25, OK.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.560
So that is also in diopters.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:35.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.925
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: It
means that the focal length

00:29:37.925 --> 00:29:40.860
of your lenses is approximately
80 centimeters, right?

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.892
AUDIENCE: Right, mhm.

00:29:41.892 --> 00:29:42.975
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:29:42.975 --> 00:29:43.590
Do you have a--?

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.750
Yeah.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.410
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.410
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.322
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:46.322 --> 00:29:48.030
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
So we will see later

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:53.030
why then correction for
myopic people is negative.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.133
I'm also myopic.

00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:56.550
And my correction, I actually
have pretty high correction.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.330
Mine minus 7 and
minus 5 diopters

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.370
in my left and right
eye, respectively.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:07.050
So it means, again, that the
focal length of my glasses

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.417
is approximately minus
1 over 7, which is--

00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:11.250
I don't know, what--

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.970
17 centimeters or something.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.400
OK.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.480
So that is the power.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.380
Now, why we use the
term optical power?

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.570
Actually, it is best
explained if you

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:29.370
look at the final animation
on this slide, which

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.810
is what happens if the ray
bundle comes from infinity

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.420
again, but it is not horizontal.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.430
It is coming at
an angle alpha 1.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.220
So now, the angle alpha
1 is not 0 anymore.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:50.720
But I let it have a
finite non-zero value.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.790
And if you do that, then
you find relatively easily

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.617
from the equation over here.

00:30:59.617 --> 00:31:00.700
Let me write the equation.

00:31:05.345 --> 00:31:20.780
We have that x2 equals alpha
1 z plus x1, 1 minus z over f.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.280
OK.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.160
So if I set z equals f
to the above equation,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.480
then I get x2 because
alpha 1 times f.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.150
This term will
disappear, of course.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.890
This will go to 0.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.080
And z will become f.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.890
So get x2 equals
alpha 1 times f.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.950
So this is the equation
for the elevation

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.910
of the focus for a
parallel ray bundle

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.500
that is arriving
non-horizontal from infinity

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.000
at some angle alpha 1.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.670
So you can also
write this equation--

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:54.670
it is not on the slide--

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.560
I will just add it
on the white board.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.320
x2 equals alpha 1 over the
power, the optical power

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.170
of the system.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.410
So the power is kind
of like a lever.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.770
It tells you as you
change the angle alpha 1,

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.900
it tells you how does the
elevation of the focus change,

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.460
with respect to
the optical axis.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.460
So it is basically,
again, if your thinking

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.580
is if you order transduction
amplification or something

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.010
like that, it tells
you as you change

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:26.730
the angle that the rays arrive
into the optical system,

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:31.580
how does the focus move with
respect to the optical axis.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.250
OK.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.120
Now, basically, these
equations that we just

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.240
described, let's see some
different cases of what

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.530
would happen to the rays.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:46.270
So what I've done here is I put
the different types of lenses

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:50.400
together with a simple
spherical refractor.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.470
And the different
types of lenses

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.500
are plain or convex where
you have one convex surface

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.100
followed by a
planar surface, Then

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.850
biconvex where you have
two planar surfaces,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:07.100
then planar concave
and biconcave.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.830
So you can see from these that
if you have a ray bundle that

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.460
is arriving horizontal, now,
horizontal from infinity,

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.120
you can see that what
will happen at the output

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.850
is actually different, depending
on the type of refraction

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.120
that you get in the
different surfaces.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.340
So I will let you work out,
based on the equation, the lens

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.070
maker's equation, I will
let you work out why

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.360
these cases are all different.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.750
But what I would like to
do is actually work out

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.840
the location of the
image, depending

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.990
on the different
cases, and also,

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.680
see how to ask with respect
to the sign convention.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.080
So starting, for example,
with a biconvex lens,

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.020
we can see that
the biconvex will

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.250
focus the parallel bundle to
the right-hand side of the lens.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.910
This is the case that we
have implicitly done so far.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.430
In my drawing so far, I have
assumed that this is the case.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.780
However, you can see that
if I have a biconcave lens,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.489
like the one shown at
the bottom of the slide,

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:17.520
you can see that each
one of these rays

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.670
will actually expand
outwards after it

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.620
passes through the lens.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.070
So in a sense that
we described so far,

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.889
this lens does not
really focus the rays.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.770
It creates a
divergent ray bundle.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:38.699
You can get a sense of focus if
you extend the divergent rays,

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:42.000
if you extend them backwards
towards the optical axis.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.380
If you do that,
you will actually

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.270
see that the rays meet.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.290
They do meet.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.290
But they meat on the
left-hand side of the lens.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.909
So now, this is an example
of focusing that happens not

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.639
on the right-hand
side of the lens,

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.070
as our equations have shown,
but on the left-hand side.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:04.740
And we can now justify
this fact if you actually

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.550
define z to be negative
and f to be negative.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.960
So this is what we
call a negative lens,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.820
or a lens with
negative focal length,

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.670
or a lens with negative power.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.000
And if you do that
now, then you will

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.090
see that the focus will
appear at the left-hand side,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.700
consistent with our
sign conventions.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.780
And this is what we call a
virtual image, as opposed

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:36.238
to the case of the biconvex lens
that we'll call a real image.

00:35:36.238 --> 00:35:41.730
So this is an example of a sign
conventions, not convections,

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:46.510
the sign conventions in action.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.880
Are there any
questions about this?

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.567
This is a point when I often
get a lot of questions.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.948
Let me move on to
a different case.

00:36:03.948 --> 00:36:05.240
And if you think of a question.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.012
Please interrupt me,
or say something aloud.

00:36:09.012 --> 00:36:13.120
Push on your microphone
button first.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.640
Let me do a slightly
different case, which

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.340
is what happens if you try to--

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.280
so in the previous
example, we saw

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.940
how a lens can take
an object at infinity

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.980
and focus it to
a finite distance

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.250
equal to the focal length.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.110
What I will do now
is I will argue

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:39.610
that the positive lens actually
can take a point object located

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:45.040
at one focal distance to the
left and image it at infinity.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.380
Now, why is that true?

00:36:50.247 --> 00:36:52.870
I will do this in a second.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.890
But you can very easily
justify it to yourself

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.730
if you simply reverse the
orientation of the rays

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.190
in the previous case.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:09.220
What we did before is we
had the ray bundle that

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.710
was starting from infinity.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.470
And the lens was focusing it.

00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:37.370
We can very easily reverse
the radiation of the rays.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.590
And if we do that,
then we can see

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.930
that if I have a point
source over here,

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.980
it will actually get
imaged at infinity.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.360
Now, of course, according
to my sign conventions,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.063
this is not the proper
way to write it.

00:37:50.063 --> 00:37:51.980
We have to make sure
that the light propagates

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.152
from left to right.

00:37:53.152 --> 00:37:54.610
So therefore, the
correct to write,

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.040
it is not what is showing over
here, simply by convention,

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.080
not because this is
physically wrong.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.160
But it does not
obey the convention.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.220
So we never actually
draw something like this.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.040
What we draw is what is shown
on the slide where the rays are

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.870
propagating from left to right.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.200
They have a focus
that is a point

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.420
object on the left-hand
side of the lens.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.510
And then the lens, of course,
will collimate these rays.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:29.170
They will convert them from
a divergence spherical wave

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.710
to a parallel plane wave.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.490
And therefore, we
limit at infinity.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.000
The same thing can be said
about the negative lens,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.810
except in this case, the ray
bundle arriving at the lens

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.740
has to be convergent
and has to come

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.380
to a focus on the
right-hand side of the lens.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.140
So therefore, in the same
way that this type of lens

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.400
formed the virtual image in the
previous case, in this case,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.220
we talk about the virtual
object for this type of lens.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:58.720
OK.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.650
So let me now try to put
this all together so it

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.850
can make some sort of sense.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.610
Again, recall the
first sign convention,

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.043
which sees that the light
propagates from left to right.

00:39:15.043 --> 00:39:16.710
If it propagates from
the left to right,

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:21.000
it means that the object should
be to the left of anything that

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.720
is of interest.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.050
And the image should be
to the right of anything

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.700
that is of interest
to the optical system.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.300
So that is why if an
object is to the left

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.440
of the optical element, as
it is in this case, then

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.260
we say that the distance from
the object to the element

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.880
is positive.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.370
If, on the other hand,
an object happens

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.770
to be on the right of
an optical element,

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:47.980
as it happens in this
case with a negative lens,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.100
then we say that the
object is virtual.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.020
And the image from the
object to the element

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:57.670
is negative, because it has
to be on the right-hand side,

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:02.750
whereas in the proper case,
it had to be on the left.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.150
That's why we put
a negative sign.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.230
Now, similar things can be
can be said about an image.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.200
Except, now, the image
is properly positioned

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.690
or the right-hand side
of the optical element.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.690
So everything is really
on the right-hand side,

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:21.380
as it happens with a
positive biconvex lens.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.500
Then the distance from
the lens to the image

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.930
will be referred to as positive,
whereas on the other hand,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.100
if it happens to be
on the left, as it

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.560
is for the case of
the negative lens,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:43.370
then this image will be
referred to as virtual,

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.438
and the distance will be
referred to as negative.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.770
Finally, and I will
conclude with this,

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:58.710
and I will let Pepe do
his demo, is how this

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.740
applies to off-axis objects.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.450
So remember we
derived this equation,

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:09.900
x2 equals alpha 1 times f, for
an object that is at infinity.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.020
Now, for a positive lens,
because the focal length

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.450
is positive, if
the angle alpha 1

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.060
is also positive,
as shown here, it

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.810
means that x2 must
also be positive.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.950
And this is indeed
what we can verify.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.715
If we apply Snell's
law repeatedly

00:41:25.715 --> 00:41:27.340
for each one of these
rays, we will see

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.910
that indeed this is the case.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.810
On the other hand, if
I use a negative lens,

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:39.100
where the quantity f, the
focal distance, is negative,

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.670
but the angle of arrival
is still positive,

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.850
then I will get x2 is negative.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:50.950
That is, x2 will also appear
below the optical axis, OK?

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.130
So this virtual image
not only appears

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.440
on the left of
the negative lens,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.480
but it is also below
the optical axis.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.180
OK?

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:09.290
Now, what about an
off-axis image at infinity?

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.700
I will skip this derivation.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.470
It is very similar
to the derivation

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:18.230
that we did before for the
case of an object at infinity.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:21.390
Basically, what I've done
here is I have reversed it.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.330
I have used an
object at a distance

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.430
f to the left of the lens.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:32.040
I have cascaded the propagation
matrix for this free space

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.160
propagation to the propagation
method corresponding

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.280
to the lens.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.220
And I have proceeded to solve.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.500
If I do this, I will
let you do it at home

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.320
and then come back
tomorrow if something

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.940
is unclear about this.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:49.078
But what I've done
is I have solved it.

00:42:49.078 --> 00:42:51.120
And when I find an equation
that looks like this,

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.030
I find that the
angle of propagation

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:58.050
of the ray bundle to the
right-hand side of the lens

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:07.077
actually equals minus the
elevation of the object divided

00:43:07.077 --> 00:43:07.910
by the focal length.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.000
Or another way to
write this equation is

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.160
alpha 2 equals minus
x1 times the power

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.840
of the optical
element, according

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.800
to the definition of power
that I remind you by definition

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.030
equals 1 over the focal length.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.530
OK.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.920
So there's a minus
sign now, which

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:33.390
means that if we apply this
equation to our positive lens,

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.030
the ray bundle that will
emerge from the lens

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.030
will actually now
propagate downwards, OK?

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.450
Because in this
case, x1 is positive

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.370
and the focal
length is positive,

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.440
alpha 2 has to be negative.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.540
And negative alpha 2
means that ray bundle

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.040
has to propagate downwards.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.930
OK?

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.440
If I do the same exercise
for the negative lens,

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:03.250
then we can see, again,
very easily that because x1,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.950
If I pick it to be
positive, f is negative

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:10.490
and I have a spare negative
sign from the equation.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:15.560
Then I can see that the
propagation angle, alpha 2,

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.640
will be positive.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:22.220
That is, the image
at infinity will

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:28.580
be on the positive side,
above the optical axis, OK?

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.520
I hope the positive and negative
signs are not confusing.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.470
Let me restate.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.450
When I learned
optics, I found this

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:38.080
to be also horribly confusing.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.440
So I realize and I sympathize
how at the beginning,

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.040
this can be a little
bit confusing.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.980
I've done my best
here to present them

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:54.200
better than the professional who
taught them to me solve them.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.770
So I hope, because I sort
of used my own confusion

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.050
as a guide, I hope
that I managed

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.510
to make it a little
bit clearer for you

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.173
if it is the first
time you see it.

00:45:04.173 --> 00:45:05.840
But, of course, it
will become even more

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.940
clearer as you practice, OK?

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.420
So the homeworks and the
examples that we see later,

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.020
they will make it
progressively clearer.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.420
For now, what I want
you to do between now

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.530
and tomorrow's lecture is
to go back and make sure

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.790
that these pictures that I've
drawn, that they make sense

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:26.653
with Snell's law.

00:45:26.653 --> 00:45:28.070
In other words,
what you do is you

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.250
go to the spherical surface.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.400
You imagine a normal to
the surface at each point.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.960
You apply Snell's law.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.890
And you convince yourselves that
the rays bend the correct way.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.580
And this is consistent with the
way they image is formed, OK?

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.140
And then you apply all the
methods, all the equations,

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.450
and so on and so forth.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.325
I broke my promise and I did not
leave Pepe with his 5 minutes.

00:45:51.325 --> 00:45:52.950
But that's because
it took us 5 minutes

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.740
to fix the figures, the
display, or whatever

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.280
was happening at the beginning.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.923
So hopefully, you guys can
stay for a little bit longer,

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:00.840
so we can do the demo.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.620
Is that OK?

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.030
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.050
I'll try to do it.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:05.520
We'll try to do it fast.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.658
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Also, and look at the--

00:46:07.658 --> 00:46:08.450
PROFESSOR: So now--

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:09.040
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.123
PROFESSOR: We can switch
to their cameras, please.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.040
OK.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.000
So here we go.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.900
OK so we tried to
set up these webcams

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.340
because last time it was a
bit hard to see the demo.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.610
So this demo has
actually two parts.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:31.650
But today, we're just going
to show one part, namely,

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.502
the refraction.

00:46:32.502 --> 00:46:34.960
And we're going to basically
witness how Fermat's principle

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.252
that we've been learning in
the past couple of classes,

00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:39.970
the Snell's law, applies
in these systems,

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.310
like lenses or prisms that
we've been learning so far.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:46.930
So before actually
changing the exposure,

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.170
let me just show the set up.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:54.040
So we are going to be focusing
on this half of the set up.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.620
So hopefully, you
can see it fine here.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.810
Let me just move this window.

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.740
So to avoid any problems
about chromatic dispersion

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.690
or wavelength-dependent
behavior,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.970
we're using a laser,
a green laser.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.820
So this component
here is the laser.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.590
Then this is a new
component that we're

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.470
going to call-- it's
called spatial filter.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:17.618
This, for now, it has a
very interesting property

00:47:17.618 --> 00:47:19.660
that we'll learn in the
second half of the course

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.850
when we learn about
Fourier optics.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.780
For this first part, just think
about this produces a very nice

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.300
point source object.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.890
So therefore, after
this lens, there's

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:32.440
going to be a spherical
wave emanating, propagating.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.260
So what we want to
do after that is

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.230
to convert that spherical
wave into a plane wave, right?

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.120
So this is what this
lens here is doing.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.880
And that's what we
call collimation.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.400
So after this lens,
as you can see-- well,

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.770
you'll see it in a second.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.270
OK.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.370
So now, I reduce the
exposure of the camera,

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.600
and I can see the rays.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.540
Now, I see parallel rays.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.040
Hopefully, you can
see them clearly.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.540
Could you zoom in a little bit?

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.540
OK.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.700
And we have basically
parallel rays coming out

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.880
of the collimated lens.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.722
So now, this brings
another interesting.

00:48:06.722 --> 00:48:08.180
As you can see,
our eyes, and we'll

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.700
see it next lecture,
how they are really

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.070
robust to focusing in
different conditions,

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.360
to change illumination.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.270
And more particularly,
they're adapted

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:22.610
to high-contrast in light,
like very high intensity

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.260
in the light and low intensity.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.360
Your eyes can see it
fine, whereas this camera,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.840
we just need it to
change exposure,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.820
so you could be
able to see that.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.850
So this is a problem
of dynamic range

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.420
that occurs in optical systems.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.130
So, all right, let's look
at the first component.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.050
It's this lens here.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:42.930
I'm going to put
cylindrical lens.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:47.030
It's a plano curve lens
here that it's cylindrical.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.010
Basically, it means
that the surface only

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:53.715
depends on the x-coordinate.

00:48:53.715 --> 00:48:54.590
So we'll put it here.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:55.430
And [INAUDIBLE] wavelength.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.030
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: If
I may interject here.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.430
Pepe, if I may
interject something?

00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.340
PROFESSOR: Sure, sure, sure.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.140
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That equations

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.770
that we derived,
strictly speaking,

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.410
they're for cylindrical
lenses, right,

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.130
because we only use
x in our equations.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:06.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.350
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
If you have an x and y,

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.060
then you get the
proper spherical lens.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.775
So strictly speaking, this is--

00:49:13.775 --> 00:49:14.442
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:14.442 --> 00:49:16.430
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
--what that equations--

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.830
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:17.830
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.110
PROFESSOR: So now, you can see
now the ray tracing, but now

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:21.890
done optically.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:27.260
You can see how the rays started
focusing in to this point here.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.690
Well, in this case, now, since
this is cylindrical lens,

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:31.910
we see that it's a line.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.580
And I can put this card here
and we see that we actually

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:38.170
form a line instead of a point.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.740
Other nice things to
see about this lens

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.130
is that so far, we've
been ignoring reflections

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:44.360
that occur with this lens.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.030
But let me just show you
some of the reflections

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.870
in this cardboard here.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.550
So we'll see in the
second part of the course

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:54.560
that these reflections
are occurring,

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.800
transitioning from the air and
glass interface and back again.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.690
So in these interfaces are
very sensitive to the angle

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:05.210
of incidence and to
the refractive indexes

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:08.817
of both the lens and
the surrounding media.

00:50:08.817 --> 00:50:11.150
So in this case, you can see
that quite a lot of power--

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.890
so this is the incidence wave.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:14.390
And you can see
quite a lot of power

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.900
is actually going to this side
because this lens might not

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:21.710
be AR-coated, or coated with
an anti-reflection coating

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:25.720
as a better lens would be.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.690
So now, let's witness Snell's
law with this prism here.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.830
So you see the little rays
here that are going straight.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:36.220
So now, I introduce
this prism shown here.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.090
It looks very dark.

00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:39.740
But believe me,
there's a prism here.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.860
And then as soon as I started
putting it into the system,

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.950
you see how the light starts
bending to one side more.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.710
And then you can see how
basically, the tilted surface

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:59.360
is bending the light, and I
can just change the angle.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.460
And let's now see
the other phenomena

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.220
that we learned in the
previous class, which is TIR.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.320
So I still rotate this more.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.620
I make the angle to be larger
than the critical angle,

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.370
and boom.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.880
All the light gets TIRed
and we can actually see, now

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.540
that it's getting to this side.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.803
But in this side of the
prism, there is a diffuser.

00:51:18.803 --> 00:51:20.720
And that's why you see
the diffused light here

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.540
very bright.

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.390
So I'm going to do
it one more time.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.320
Without TIR.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.496
All the light goes, escapes
out straight through.

00:51:27.496 --> 00:51:31.740
And now, I start
rotating this more.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.100
And then you see TIR here.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:37.512
There are any questions?

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:47.840
So I also brought a parabolic
reflector for you guys,

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.420
like the people here
in MIT if you guys

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:54.950
want to see the reflection,
how you see your face.

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.150
Look at your face with
this parabolic reflector.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.600
It's actually quite
funny to see the virtual

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.630
and the real images.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:02.255
And in this case,
you'll see, and we'll

00:52:02.255 --> 00:52:04.970
learn in next class, how
the virtual image generated

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.680
by such a reflector, it's
actually not inverted.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.720
It's erected, as it's called.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.060
So I'll leave it here, so
you can come after class.

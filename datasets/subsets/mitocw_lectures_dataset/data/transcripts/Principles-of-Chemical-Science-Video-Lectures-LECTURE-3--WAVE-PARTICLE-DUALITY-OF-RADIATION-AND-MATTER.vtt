00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's pick up from where we
were on Friday.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We had discovered the nucleus.
Now we were faced with the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
problem, as all the scientific
community was in 1911,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in trying to understand the
structure of the atom.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Where was the nucleus in the
atom?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Where was the electron?
How were they bound?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
How did they hang together?
And we talked about the fact

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that the electron in the
nucleus, the force of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
interaction is the Coulomb
force.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And we started talking about
how, at that time,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the only equation of motion
that was going to allow us to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
figure out how the electron and
nucleus moved under influence of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
this Coulomb force was Newton's
equations of motion,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in particular the Second Law,
F equals ma.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And so, in order to apply that
equation of motion,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we needed a model for the atom.
And what was the simplest and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
most obvious thing to do was to
suggest the planetary model.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
After all, that is how the
astronomical bodies moved around

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the sun.
And so the model that is set up

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is one where this electron has a
uniform circular motion around

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the nucleus with a well-defined
radius, which we called r star.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We said that given this,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the acceleration was a
constant.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It was given by v squared over.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The linear velocity over r.
We plugged that into F equals,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
put in the Coulomb force,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and from that we were able to
calculate the kinetic energy of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that electron going around the
nucleus.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, the reason I want to
calculate the kinetic energy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
from this model is because I
want to ultimately calculate the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
total energy.
And why I want to calculate the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
total energy is going to be
obvious in just a few minutes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
My goal is to get the total
energy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Actually, I am using my notes
from Friday because I didn't

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
finish them.
You may need to get them out.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This will probably often be the
case, is that I won't quite

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
finish the notes from the other
lecture.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I will start out the next
lecture where I left off,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so you should bring your
previous day's notes to class

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
if, in fact, you use them during
class.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I want the kinetic energy plus
the potential energy because I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
want both of them to add them up
to get the total energy.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I know the kinetic energy.
Now, we need the potential

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
energy.
What is the potential energy?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Well, the potential energy is
the integral over the operating

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
force over the appropriate
limits.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
In this case,
if our force of interaction is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the Coulomb force,
which I will just represent as

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
F of r,
I am going to integrate this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
from r star out,
and this is going to be minus

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the integral of the force.
Now, some of you may have seen

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
this before.
This is a general case,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the potential energy of
anything is minus the integral

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of the operating force over the
appropriate coordinates.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
If you have seen it before,
that is fine,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you are happy.
If you have not seen this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
before, you are panicked.
Don't panic.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I do not hold you responsible
for this.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You will see it in 8.01 later
on this semester.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
When you see it later on,
you can come back here and say,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
okay, now I know what is going
on.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But I just need it right now to
make a point about the total

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
energy of the system.
And that is what is going to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
lead me to the conundrum.
I need the potential energy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It is the integral of the
force.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Let me plug in,
here, my force that is

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
operating, e squared 4 pi
epsilon nought r squared.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I do that integral and put in

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the appropriate limits.
It is minus e squared over 4 pi

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
epsilon nought r star.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Now I have kinetic energy plus
potential energy.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Let me add them up.
The kinetic is one-half e

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
squared 4 pi epsilon nought r
star.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Potential, minus e squared over

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
4 pi epsilon nought r star.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The result is minus one-half e
squared 4 pi epsilon nought r

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
star.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
That is the total energy here

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
of this particular system.
Well, why I wanted this total

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
energy is to show you that this
total energy is negative.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
What that negative means to us
is that the system is bound.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The electron and the nucleus
are stuck together.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And I can show you that maybe a
little more clearly if I draw an

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
energy level diagram.
Let me plot here the total

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
energy.
And I am plotting it as a

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
function of r,
the distance between the

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
electron and the nucleus.
Well, what you can see is that

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
for very large r,
the energy here is going to be

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
zero.
Way out here,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
for very large r,
where we have the electron and

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the nucleus separated infinitely
apart, the energy is zero.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And, of course,
as you bring them closer

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
together, the energy goes down.
And when you are exactly,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and we calculated this,
at r star here,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
well, then the total energy is
minus one-half e squared over 4

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
pi epsilon nought times r star.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
If you brought the electron and

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the nucleus into this value here
of r star,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the energy would change like
that.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But the big point is this
energy is negative,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
or it is lower than the
electron and the nucleus

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
separated.
That means that the electron

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and nucleus are stuck together.
You are going to have to put

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
this much energy into the system
in order to pull them apart.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That is the big point here,
is that this model so far looks

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
like everything is hunky-dory.
Everything is working.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The electron stuck to the
nucleus.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It is not going anywhere.
It looks terrific.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But here comes the conundrum.
The conundrum is that classical

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
electromagnetism,
which was pretty well

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
understood by this time,
1911, 1912.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Maxwell's equations,
that was down pat.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But what classical
electromagnetism says is that

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
when you have a charge,
and this electron is a charge,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that is accelerating,
that charge has to be emitting

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
radiation.
It has to be giving off energy.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
After all, that is actually how
an antenna works.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
In an antenna,
what you are doing is taking

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
charge and sloshing it,
accelerating it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
When it accelerates,
it emits radiation.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
That is how you broadcast.
That is true,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it was known in 1911.
Synchrotron radiation works the

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
same way.
When you have a synchrotron,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the way you get synchrotron
radiation is essentially by

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
accelerating charge.
That is a given and is

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
actually, again,
something you will talk about

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in much more detail in 8.02.
But the point here is if this

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
charge is being accelerated,
and it is, then it must be

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
giving off radiation.
It must be giving off energy.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Well, if it is giving off
energy, we look at our energy

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
expression here.
That must mean that the energy

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
in the system is going down
because it is losing the energy.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It is giving it off to
radiation.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
If E is going down,
it is getting more negative

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
here.
The only way for E to get more

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
negative is for this r star
right here to be changing.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Is for r star to be getting
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Well, we could set up another
set of equations using what we

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
know from classical
electromagnetism and from what

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
we have already done here.
What we would find is that this

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000
value here of r star would go to
zero in t equal 10^-10 seconds

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
if r was originally on the order
of an angstrom to begin with.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Here is the problem.
Classical equations of motion

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
coupled with classical
electromagnetism,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
they are making a prediction
that my atom is not going to

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
live more than 10^-10 seconds.
Because in 10^-10 seconds,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that electron is on top of the
nucleus.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We no longer have an atom that
was already known to have a

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
volume associated with a
diameter that is about an

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
angstrom.
The classical way of thinking

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
is making a prediction that is
not consistent with the

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
observations at that time.
And even now,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
it is predicted that the atom
essentially kind of annihilates,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
collapses in 10^-10 seconds.
And that is the problem that

00:12:10.599 --> 00:31:51.000
the scientific community had in

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
That is the problem we have
right now.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And they had it for 10,
12 years.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Now you can say what is wrong
here?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Well, it is possible,
and they were thinking about

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
this, too.
It is possible that maybe this

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
force is wrong,
this Coulomb force.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That is a possibility.
Or, of course,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
maybe it is the equations of
motion that are wrong.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That is possible.
Or, maybe it is classical

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
electromagnetism that is wrong.
Well, of course what it is

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
going to turn out to be is the
equations of motion,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
F equals ma.
Bottom line is that you cannot

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
use classical mechanics to
explain the motion of this

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
microscopic particle,
the atom, in the constrained

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
environment of an atom.
That is the bottom line.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We need different mechanics.
We cannot use classical

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
mechanics to describe how that
electron hangs on that nucleus,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
how they are bound.
And so that was the problem.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
This signaled something was
really amiss in the scientific

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
community in the world at that
time.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
That is our problem now,
too.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
What is the next step?
Well, historically the clues

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
about why the electron did not
actually collapse into the

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
nucleus, like classical physics
predicted, came from a

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
completely different area of
discussion.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It came from the discussion of
the wave-particle duality of

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
light and matter.
It was long believed that

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
matter, with its particle-like
behavior, was distinct from

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
light, which was this
transmission of energy through

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
space.
But, in the last 1800s and

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
early 1900s, there were a few
experiments that appeared on the

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
horizon that began to suggest
that maybe this boundary between

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
matter with its particle-like
behavior and radiation with its

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
wave-like behavior was not as
rigid as thought.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And, in fact,
what we are going to see is

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
that radiation has both
wave-like properties and

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
particle-like properties.
It depends on the particular

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
experiment that you do which one
of those behaviors you see.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And, consequently,
matter behaves both as a

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
particle and a wave.
Again, it depends on exactly

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
what experiment you do,
which one of those properties

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
you observe.
What we are going to do right

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
now is put aside the discussion
of the structure of the atom.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
We are going to put it aside
until next Monday.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We have to do that because we
need some more information in

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
order to take a big leap to get
us out of this constraint of

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
classical mechanics.
And those clues,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
as I said, came from this
discussion of the wave-particle

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
duality of light and matter.
And that is what we are going

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
to be talking about for the next
three lectures.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Then we are going to come back
and tie in those results to the

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
structure of the atom.
Of course, where that is going

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to lead us is a new equation of
motion called quantum mechanics.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
That is where we are going.
Let's start off by talking

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
about radiation or light.
We are going to talk about its

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
wave-like properties,
then Wednesday we are going to

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
talk about the particle-like
properties of light,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and Friday we are going to talk
about the wave-like properties

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
of matter.
That is where we are going.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Let's talk about waves here.
You all know that waves are

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
some periodic variation of a
quantity.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
A water wave,
for example,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
is a periodic variation of the
level of water.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
At some points in space,
the water level is high.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
At other points,
the water level is low.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Sound wave.
Well, a sound wave is the

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
periodic variation of the
density of air.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
At some points in space,
the air is very dense.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
At other points in space,
the air is not dense.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Well, light or radiation is a
period variation of an electric

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
field, as I depict here on this
slide.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Electric field versus position.
There is a periodic variation

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
of the electric field.
Now, exactly what is an

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
electric field?
Some of you know this,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
some of you don't,
but an electric field is

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
literally the space through
which the Coulomb force

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
operates.
For example,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
if we have a negatively charged
plate and a positively charged

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
plate here.
The space through which the

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Coulomb force is operating here,
and the Coulomb force is

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
operating because we have two
plates here that are oppositely

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
charged.
The electric field is the space

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
through which the Coulomb force
operates.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
If we put a positive charge in
that space, you know what is

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
going to happen.
In this coordinated system,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
the positive charge is going to
float up.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Because the negatively charged
plate is up above.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
If we reversed the potential
difference and put a positively

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
charged particle in this
electric field,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
in this space,
it is going to move down

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
because now the negatively
charged plate is lower.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
This electric field here has
not only magnitude --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
You can imagine here the
magnitude is given by the

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
difference in the potentials of
these plates.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The larger the difference,
the larger the magnitude.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
But it also has direction.
In one case,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
it is pointed this way.
In the other case,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
it is pointed that way.
And that is reflected here on

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
this plot of the electric field
here.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
What you see is that right
here, the magnitude of the

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
electric field is small.
As you move along in x,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
that magnitude increases,
goes to a maximum,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
then turns around and at some
point literally is zero.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And then the electric field
changes direction and its

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
magnitude increases in the
opposite direction.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Increases, increases,
gets to a point,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
then turns around and becomes
zero again.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
If you have a charge in a
radiation field and you put it

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
right here --
Well, it would be pulled in one

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
direction.
If you put it over here,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
it would be pulled in the other
direction.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
We have a magnitude and we have
a direction.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Now, not only is light a
periodic variation of the

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
electric field in space,
it is also a periodic variation

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
of the electric field in time.
That is, this is a picture of

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
that field, that one instant in
time.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
We will call it t equals 0.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
However, that electric field
moves.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
It propagates.
And the distance,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
or the time it takes for the
electric field here to move over

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
one wavelength,
I have shown this as a star.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
The time it takes for this
maximum to go from here to here,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
one wavelength,
is defined as one period.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And a period is given by one
over nu,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
where nu is the frequency of
the radiation.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
It is the number of cycles per
second.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
In other words,
if you were sitting here at x

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
equals 0,
you were tied at x equals 0,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and you were just watching this
electric field come by.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
You would see a maximum in that
electric field,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
one maximum every second if the
frequency is one Hertz.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
In other words,
the frequency is the number of

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
maxima you would see pass by you
per second.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Well, we have a unit to
characterize frequency.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I call it cycles per second.
It is cycles per second,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
but the formal unit is Hertz.
Hertz is inverse seconds.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
We leave out the number of
cycles.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
The number of cycles is implied
in the unit of Hertz.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
To give another example,
here, suppose we had some

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
radiation and the frequency of
that radiation was one Hertz.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Suppose we had an electron,
an electron is charged,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and we put here at x equals 0
and we tie it at x equals 0.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
What is going to happen to this
electron?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Well, what is going to happen
is that this electron is going

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
to be pulled down and then it is
going to be pushed back up once

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
every second because the
frequency, here,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
is one Hertz.
It is charged,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and we are tying it at x equals

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
That is our proof that the

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
It is going to go like this.
It is going to oscillate once

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
every second if this frequency
is one hertz.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Here it goes.
An electron is pulled down and

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
then pushed back up once every
second.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Now, we, of course,
can write an equation to

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
describe this oscillation of the
electric field in both space and

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
time.
x is the position variable,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
t, the time variable,
and I have written it down

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
here.
I will explain this more in

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
just a moment,
but what I also want to point

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
out is that an oscillating
electric field always,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
always, always has
perpendicular to it an

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
oscillating magnetic field.
That is well described by

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Maxwell's equations.
Again, you are going to see

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
that in 8.02.
And the magnetic field here has

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
the same essentially function
form and characteristics as this

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
electric field.
And, because it does,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I am just going to talk about
the electric field.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Here is the expression for the
magnetic field.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I just call it H.
But, again, it is a function of

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
position and time.
Here is an illustration,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
just the variation of the
electric field.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Light, radiation is actually a
variation in space and time of

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
both the electric and a magnetic
field.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
That is why it is
electromagnetic radiation.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Now, let me show you on the
8.02 website.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Let me get that rolling.
There it is.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Now we have to start it.
All right.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
One of these is the electric
field.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
The other one is the magnetic
field.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
This is a simulation that 8.02
has made for you.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
You can go and look at it on
the 8.02 website,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
but you can see it propagating
here in time,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
and you can see its variation
in space of this electromagnetic

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
field.
Let's look at this functional

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
form just a little more
carefully, just to make sure

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
everybody is on the same page.
I think many of you have seen

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
this before.
What we are going to do,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
because we have two variables,
is we are going to hold one

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
variable constant and plot it as
a function of the other

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
variable, just to explain the
parameters that go into this

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
functional form.
At time t equals 0,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
if in this equation here I
stick in t equals 0,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I have a form that looks like
this.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
It is just the cosine function
in x.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And you can see that the
amplitude goes from positive A

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
to minus A.
And so what you see is that

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
this A in front of the cosine,
the physical meaning of it is

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
just the maximum amplitude.
If you were given a functional

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
form with a number in front of a
cosine, well,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
you could read off the
amplitude immediately.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
The other parameter that
characterizes this wave is the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
wavelength.
It is the distance between two

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
successive maxima or two
successive minima.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And you can also see here that
the field is going to be at its

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
maximum amplitude whenever this
x is an integral multiple of the

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
wavelength, lambda,
2 lambda, 3 lambda,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
or minus lambda,
minus 2 lambda or zero.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
If you were given a waveform
and there was a number in front

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
of the x, you can almost,
by inspection,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
tell what the wavelength is.
That number would be equal to 2

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
pi over lambda.
Now what we are going to do is

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
hold x constant and set it equal
to zero, and then plot this

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
functional form as a function of
time.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Again, we have the cosine
function, oscillates from plus A

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
to minus A.
Now the time between two

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
successive maxima or minima is
what we spoke earlier of as the

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
period.
It is the time for one cycle.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
In other words,
is it one over the frequency.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And you get the maxima then
whenever the time is an integral

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
multiple of the period,
whenever time is 1 over nu,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
2 over nu, 3 over nu,
or minus 1 over nu,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
minus 2 over nu,
or zero.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
These are the
characteristics of the

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
functional form,
amplitudes, wavelengths,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
frequencies.
Now, I told you that the period

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
was given by 1 over nu.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Let's just do a quick proof
that the period is actually 1

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
over nu, one over frequency.
How are we going to do that?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Well, what I said was the
definition for a period was the

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
time it takes the wave to move
one wavelength.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
If this is the wave at t equals
0, this then coming up here

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
should be the wave at one period
later.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And so, if we moved over
exactly one cycle,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
what this means is that at one
period later the functional form

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
ought to look exactly like it
did at t equals 0.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
If I take my general expression
for the waveform and plug in t

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
equals 1 over nu,
I get this.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
What you can see at first
glance is that it doesn't really

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
look like this,
or at least not just yet,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
but we are going to make it
look like this and we are going

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
to do so legally.
What are we going do?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
This just repeats that
equation.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
You can already see we have
some cancellation here.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
These two nu's go away,
so I just have cosine ((2 pi x)

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
over lambda minus 2 pi).

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
In order to simplify this,
I am going to need a

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
trigonometric identity,
which you may or may not

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
remember, cosine (alpha minus
beta) is the cosine alpha times

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
cosine beta plus the sine of the
alpha sine beta.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I am going to let 2(pi)x be
alpha, and beta will be 2pi.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I am going to plug that in.
Here, we can see some nice

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
simplification.
This cosine 2pi,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
of course, is one.
The sign of

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
2pi is zero, this term goes
away, and what I have left is A

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
cosine 2 pi x over lambda at t
equals 1 over nu.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And, indeed,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
that is the same functional
field as the field at t equals

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
period is equal to 1 over nu.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Now, this wave also propagates
in space.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
It moves.
It goes from here to here.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And another important
characteristic of

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
electromagnetic reaction is the
speed with which it propagates.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Let's just quickly calculate
what that speed is.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
We have enough information to
do that.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Speed is always distance
traveled divided by time

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
elapsed.
And we said that at t equals 0,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
this is what our waveform
looked like.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
We also said that one period
later, this is what our waveform

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
looked like.
We know at one period that the

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
waveform moved over one
wavelength.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
The speed is the distance
traveled, which is a wavelength,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
divided by the time elapsed,
which is 1 over nu,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
the period.
Therefore, the speed is lambda

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
times nu.
That is the speed with which

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
this wave propagates.
And, of course,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
you already know that all
electromagnetic radiation has a

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
constant speed of about 3x10^8
meters per second,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
or we call it c.
And what that is,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000
is the product of the
wavelength times the frequency.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
The electromagnetic spectrum,
of course, is infinitely wide.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And here is the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
We won't do this in any kind of
detail, but I just want you to

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
note here that on the long
wavelength end,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
we have what we call radio
waves.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And on the short wavelength,
then, we have our gamma rays

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
and cosmic rays.
And, in the case of the gamma

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
and the cosmic rays,
because the wavelength is

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
small, lambda is small,
that means those waves have a

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
high frequency.
In the case of the radio waves,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
because those wavelengths are
long, that means those waves

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
have a lower frequency because
the frequency times the

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
wavelength is a constant.
It is this c.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
It is 3x10^8 meters per second.
And, of course,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
right in here,
a very small region,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
narrow region of the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
are the light waves that are
sensitive to our eye.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
What you do need to know is
that the red wavelengths are

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
longer and the blue wavelengths
are shorter.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Again, the important thing is
lambda times nu is always,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
for every kind of radiation,
equal to a constant.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And that constant is c. Now,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
the other thing that you just
need to know is the relative

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
ordering here in wavelengths.
You do need to know that

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
microwaves are longer
wavelengths than gamma rays.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
All MIT students should know
that.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And one other thing I might
say, because we are going to

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
talk about this a little later
in the course.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
See these microwaves?
Well, molecules will absorb

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
microwaves, take it in.
That kind of radiation is going

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
to set the molecule rotating.
Molecules will absorb infrared

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
radiation, and that kind of
radiation is going to set the

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
molecules vibrating.
Molecules will absorb visible

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
and ultraviolet radiation.
What that is going to do is

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
promote an electron to an
excited state.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Then sometimes those electrons,
in the excited state,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
want to relax back down to the
ground state.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
When they do so they give off
radiation.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
That is the origin of
fluorescence and sometimes

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
phosphorescence.
Then sometimes molecules will

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
also fluoresce if they absorb
X-rays, but with X-rays,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
if a molecule absorbs them,
it also kicks out an electron.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
And we will be looking at that
in a few days to identify the

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
energy levels in atoms and
molecules.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
This, I think,
you are familiar with.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
So far I have just told you
what electromagnetic radiation

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
is, how we characterize it:
speed, frequency,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
wavelength, maximum amplitude.
But what I have not shown you,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
yet, is any evidence that
indeed light has wave-like

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
characteristics.
And to do that we are going to

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
do the experiment that
essentially was done to

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
demonstrate the wave-like
behavior of light,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
and that is Young's two-slit
experiment.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
This is the late 1800s.
What was done was to take a

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
source of monochromatic
radiation.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
We are going to use 6
angstroms, 633 nanometers.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It is a helium neon laser.
And it is going to impinge on

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
just a thin metal plate.
It does not have to be metal.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
It can be anything.
But what we did was poke two

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
holes in it, made two slits.
And naively you might think,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
if you looked at a screen out
here, that this screen will

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
light up in spots that are
directly opposite those slights.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Because, after all,
light travels in straight

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
lines.
And so if the slits here are

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
0.005 meters apart,
you might think that the two

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
bright spots on the slit will be
about 0.02 inches apart.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Well, of course,
that isn't the case.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
What you really see is an array
of bright spots.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
And Christine has up there in
the projection booth a helium

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
neon laser that is shinning
behind two slits.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
You've got really beautifully
now, Christine.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
That is great.
And what you see is that there

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
is a whole array of spots.
There aren't just two spots.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
There is a bunch of spots here,
bright spot,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
dark spot, bright spot,
dark spot.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
You've also got another pattern
superimposed on that.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
It almost looks like you would
see the single slit diffraction,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
too, on top of the double slit,
but we won't get into that.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
But this is not just two spots.
Let's see if we can try to

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
understand how this pattern
arises, what this pattern comes

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
from.
Well, waves have the property

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
of superposition.
Superposition means that if I

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
take a wave and have it in
space, but now I take a second

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
wave and put it in the same
place in space but make it such

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
that the maxima of both waves
are in the identical place in

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
space, what I have is a
situation where the two waves

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000
add that property of addition of
waves --

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
When they are in the same place
in space, that property is

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
called superposition.
That is the property of waves.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And in this particular case,
we are going to have what we

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
call constructive interference.
They are going to add up such

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
that the amplitude here of the
resulting wave is going to be

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
twice the amplitude of each of
the individual waves.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
This is constructive
interference.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
On the other hand,
I can have two waves in the

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
same place in space,
but they can be positioned so

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
that the maximum of one wave is
at the same point in space as

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
the minimum of the other.
And because we have these

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
positive and negative
amplitudes, well,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
then these are going to cancel
when they add up and we are

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
going to have the null result.
We are going to have no

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
intensity.
That is called destructive

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
interference.
Well, in order to understand

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
how this property of
interference gives rise to these

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
array of bright spots in the two
slit experiment,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
let me actually use water waves
as an example to try to

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.000
understand why we get this array
of spots, or this row of bright

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
spots and dark spots.
Here is the beach.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Here is the water.
This is the top view.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Here is the water.
Here is the sand.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Here is where I wanted to be
all weekend.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
And the waves are rolling in to
the shore.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
There are the wave fronts.
And then suppose I get

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
ambitious and,
for whatever perverse reason,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I decide to build a barrier to
prevent these waves from coming

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
onto the beach.
Except I poke two holes in the

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
barrier, two little holes.
Well, you know what is going to

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
happen.
When the wave approaches that

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
barrier, well,
through that little hole a

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
little bit of the wave is going
to sneak through.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And because that little hole is
really pretty little,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
what is going to happen is that
the wave front is going to

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
spread out isotropically.
And so that wave front is going

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
to look like a semicircle
centered on that little hole.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
And, of course,
this wave front is going to

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
keep propagating.
And it propagates out.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And then soon enough,
a wavelength later,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
another wave sneaks through and
I have two semi-circles.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
And the distance between those
two semi-circles is lambda.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
That is the wavelength.
That is the wave crest.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
That is the maximum of the
wave.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Keep going.
That propagates out.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Keep going.
That propagates out.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Well, at the same time that the
waves are sneaking out through

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
that little hole,
waves are sneaking out through

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
this little hole.
And I will color them green.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
That wave propagates out and
keeps propagating.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
The other one sneaks through
and keeps propagating.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And now let me clean up the
drawing a little bit.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And I am going to call this
slit one.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
The green waves are the waves
that have come through slit one.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
The blue waves are the ones
that have come through slit two.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And the distance between any
two successive maxima here,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
or any two semi-circles is,
of course, lambda.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And lambda is the same for slit
one and slit two.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Now, I want you to look at this
spot that I just circled right

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
here.
Right here what do you see?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Interference.
Absolutely.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
You have two maxima at the same
place in space.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
You are going to have
constructive interference right

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
there.
What about this spot?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Constructive interference.
What about this spot?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Right.
Everywhere along that line you

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
are going to have constructive
interference.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Now, let me just tell you one
other thing.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
We have every constructive
interference all along this

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
line.
Now look right at this point

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
here.
What you see is you have the

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
superposition of the blue wave
that has come from slit two,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
and this blue wave has traveled
out from slit two a distance

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
four lambda.
One, two, three,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
four lambda.
That is the radius.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
It has traveled out a distance
four lambda.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
It is constructively
interfering with a wave coming

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000
from slit one that has traveled
out a distance three lambda.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
One, two, three.
The difference in the distance

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
traveled by those two waves that
are constructively interfering

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
is one lambda.
Let's keep going in order to

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
understand this diagram.
Let's look at this spot.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Right here, what do you have?
Constructive interference.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Right here you have
constructive interference.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
If you kept going you would
see, everywhere along this line,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
constructive interference.
Now let's look at the

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
difference in the distance
traveled by the waves that are

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
constructively interfering along
that line.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Well, you see the green wave
here?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
The wave that is constructively
interfering is one that has

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
traveled out a distance two
lambda.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
That is, r sub one is equal to
two lambda.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
It is interfering
with this wave front

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
that has traveled out a distance
four lambda.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
The difference in the distance
traveled by those two waves is

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
two lambda.
4 lambda minus 2 lambda equals

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
2 lambda.
I think on your notes,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
it is actually this case that I
have written it down.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Here is another point of
constructive interference.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Here is another point of
constructive interference.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Everywhere along this line,
we have constructive

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
interference.
And, if you analyze this,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
the difference in the distance
traveled would be zero.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
What you would expect,
if you were to image this,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
you'd expect right here very
bright spot, very bright spot,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
very bright spot.
This is going to be symmetric

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
around the center,
so there will be a bright spot

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
out here, a bright spot out
there.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Let's look at this actually in
real life in a water tank.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
There we go,
up here on the side boards.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Here are the waves coming this
way onto some barrier,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
and here are the holes.
Here is one hole.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Here is the other hole.
And then these bright

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
semi-circles are the wave
fronts.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And what I want you to notice,
and you have to kind of look

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
out here, right there you see a
whole bunch of very bright

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
spots.
Well, if this were light and we

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
had a screen then right here we
would see the screen light up.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And then right here you see
kind of nothing.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
That nothing is destructive
interference.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
That would be a dark spot if,
in fact, this were light and we

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
were looking at a screen.
Then here is another very

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
bright spot.
Here is another very bright

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
spot.
This is on a website from the

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
University of Colorado,
which, if you are not familiar

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
with, is actually kind of a very
neat website.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
It has some very elementary
topics in it,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
but it also has some topics
that even you would be

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
interested in.
And that is actually the name

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
of the website.
And so what is going on here,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.000
in the case of the light,
is just what we have explained.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
We've got this line of
constructive interference that

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
is going to result on the screen
as a very bright spot.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
And then another line with
another bright spot and another

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
line with a very bright spot.
And this is symmetric around

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
the zero.
Right at this point we have

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
constructive interference.
In between we have destructive

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
interference.
Constructive,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
destructive,
constructive.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And that is the origin of the
many different bright spots.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
And now there is a condition
that has to obtain in order for

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
there to be maximum constructive
interference,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
and that is this condition.
The difference in the distance

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
traveled of the two waves that
are interfering to give us that

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
maximum constructive
interference has to be an

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
integral multiple of the
wavelength.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I will explain this a little
bit more starting on Wednesday.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Okay.
See you then.

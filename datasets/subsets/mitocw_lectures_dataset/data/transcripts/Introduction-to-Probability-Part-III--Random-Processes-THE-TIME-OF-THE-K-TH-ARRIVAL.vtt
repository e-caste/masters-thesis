00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.600
An interesting random variable
associated with the Bernoulli

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.840
process is the time
of the kth success

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.340
or the time of the
kth arrival, depending

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.290
on what kind of context
we have in mind.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.700
So the picture is as follows.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.040
The process starts and we wait
until the first arrival occurs,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.380
and the time that it occurs,
we call that time Y1.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.990
Then we keep
observing the process,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.670
and there's a time at which
a second arrival comes.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.080
We call that time Y2.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.660
The process continues, and
there is a certain time

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.000
that the third arrival comes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.740
We call that time Y3.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.390
Now, the time that the
first arrival comes,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.154
this is also what we called T1.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.150
T1 is this length.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.890
It's the time until
the first arrival.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.120
Let us give a name to the
time it takes from the first

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.789
to the second arrival,
and we call that time T2,

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.670
which is the second
inter-arrival time.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
And similarly, we
will call T3 the time

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
between the second
and the third arrival.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.770
So we define in general Tk to
be the difference between two

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.900
consecutive arrival times.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.770
And of course, the time
of the third arrival

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.270
is the sum of T1 plus T2
plus T3, the first three

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880
inter-arrival times.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.259
And more generally, Yk is
going to be the sum of these k

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.550
inter-arrival times.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.370
So in order to study the random
variable Yk and its properties,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.950
the way that we can
proceed is to understand

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.250
first the random variables Ti.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.130
What kind of random
variables are they?

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.850
Well, we know that T1, the
time until the first arrival,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.300
has a geometric distribution
with parameter p.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.930
Now, at the time of
the first arrival,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.340
the process starts fresh.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.009
So after this
time, there will be

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.550
a sequence of independent
Bernoulli trials,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.040
and T2 will be the number
of Bernoulli trials

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.290
it takes until an arrival.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.530
So T2 will also be geometric
with the same parameter, p.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.520
Furthermore, because the
process starts fresh,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.340
whatever happens in the
future after this time

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.950
is independent from whatever
happened in the past,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.670
and so the random variable T2
will be independent from T1.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.800
And then by a
similar argument, T3

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.110
will be independent
from T1 and T2

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.990
and will also have the same
geometric distribution.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.390
Based on these
properties, we can now

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.730
go ahead and calculate
properties of Yk.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.530
Yk is the sum of
random variables.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.810
The expected value
of Yk is the sum

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.030
of the expected
values of the Ts.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.320
Each one of the Ts has
a geometric distribution

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.270
with parameter p,
and in particular

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.000
has a mean of 1 over p.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.410
By adding those means, we
obtain that the mean of Yk

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.740
is k over p.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.730
Similarly, the
variance of Yk will

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.960
be equal to the sum
of the variances

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.620
of the Tis, the reason being
that the Tis are independent,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.660
and so to find the
variance of the sum,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.350
it's enough to just
add the variances.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.220
And we have a formula for
the variance of a geometric,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.980
and using that formula
and multiplying it by k,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.450
we obtain the variance of Yk.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.890
Finally, we would like to
calculate the PMF of Yk.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.430
So we would like to find
this probability here,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.130
the probability that Yk takes
on a specific value equal to t.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.610
Notice that in this
argument, we're

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.610
thinking of k as a
fixed, given number.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.840
For example, we're interested in
the time of the fifth arrival.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.790
This is a random variable that
can take different values,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.510
t, and we want to
find the probabilities

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.400
of those different values, t.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.140
So think of k as being fixed and
t as a parameter that varies,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.310
and we want to carry
out this calculation

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.269
for all possible choices of t.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.320
Now, what is this event here?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.360
This is the event that the
kth arrival occurs at time t.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.720
So this means that at time
t, we have an arrival.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.409
But for this to be
the kth arrival,

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:43.090
we must have k minus 1
arrivals in the previous time

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.100
slots, of which there's
t minus 1 of them.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.695
The probability that
Yk is equal to t

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:56.070
is the probability that
these two events happen, k

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.010
minus 1 arrivals in t minus
1 slots and one arrival

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.200
at slot number t.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.080
So we are looking
at the probability

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.220
that these two events occur.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.460
Now this event, k minus 1
arrivals in t minus 1 slots,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.480
is an event that's
completely determined

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.860
by whatever happens in the
first t minus 1 time slots,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.830
whereas the event of an
arrival at slot time t

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.210
refers to whatever happens
during slot time t.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.900
Because of our assumptions on
the Bernoulli process, whatever

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.080
happens during these
t minus 1 time slots

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.270
is independent from what
happens in slot number t.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.140
So the probability of
these two events happening,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.170
because of independence,
will be the probability

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:54.370
of the first event happening,
k minus 1 arrivals in time

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:03.160
t minus 1, times the probability
of an arrival at time t.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.840
Now, the first probability is
given by the binomial formula.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.630
In t minus 1 time slots, we
want to have k minus 1 arrivals.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.960
And the binomial
formula gives us

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.370
an exponent, p to this
power times 1 minus p

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.510
to the power that's the
difference of these two

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.920
numbers, which is t minus k.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.280
And then finally, we
multiply with the probability

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.930
of an arrival at time
t, which is equal to p.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.100
This p will cancel the
exponent of minus 1 up here

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.820
and leads us to this
formula for the probability

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.490
that the kth arrival
happens at time t.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.085
Notice the range of
the random variable Yk.

00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:56.780
The kth arrival cannot
happen before time k.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.320
You need at least k time
slots to obtain k arrivals,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.890
so this probability
will be positive

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.560
only starting at time
k and for future times.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.220
So this random variable
Yk, in general,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.000
will have a PMF of this form.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.790
It's zero for ts smaller than k,
and then at time k, in general,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.340
it's going to be
a positive entry.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.300
And for future values
of t, it will also

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.020
have positive entries.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.320
And this PMF extends
all the way to infinity

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.240
because it is possible
that the kth arrival takes

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.520
an arbitrarily
long time to occur.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.770
If we consider different
values of k, of course

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.350
we will get a different PMF.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.990
The PMF of Y3 is different
than the PMF of Y2.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.160
And the PMF of Y3
will generally sit

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.100
to the right of the PMF of
Y2 because the third arrival

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.867
generally will take longer to
occur than the second arrival.

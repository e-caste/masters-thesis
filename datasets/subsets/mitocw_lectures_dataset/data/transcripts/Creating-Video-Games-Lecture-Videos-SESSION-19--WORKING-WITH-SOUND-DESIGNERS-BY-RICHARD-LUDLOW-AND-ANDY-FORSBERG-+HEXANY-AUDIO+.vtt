00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.130
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.450
Just a few announcements before
we get into the lecture today.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.680
So the structure for today--
our lecture, two hours'

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.630
work in your groups.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.825
We have, unfortunately,
Elle, the grad student

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:39.570
who's working with
the heat wave, who

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.050
would be using the heat
wave game, is sick today.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.930
So she won't be able to come in.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.430
But I'm working on rescheduling
a time for her to come in.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.370
What I'd love to do is if we can
get her a web link of the heat

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.020
wave game that she could
then give you feedback on,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.160
that might be good for you all.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.800
For the rest of the class,
we've got Pablo in today.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.375
He talked to the
snap team already.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.000
Is he going to talk
to you again today?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600
Or are you guys all on
the right page with him?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.520
STUDENT: It'd be nice
to show him the game.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.240
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.823
Oh, you didn't show
him the game then?

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:12.857
OK, cool, cool.

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:14.440
What I'd like him
to do is take a look

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.780
at the forecast-based
future game

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.685
today if he can at 2 o'clock.

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.310
I'm going to just
show him a build, get

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.240
some feedback from him.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210
And then he'll take a
look at the snap game.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.800
And then if he's got time,
the two cholera games.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.130
He can take a look at those.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.960
And again, if you
want to give him

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.360
web links to playable
versions of the games,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360
just send them to the
Video Game Bosses list.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.170
And I'll forward along.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.690
Other announcements--
I'm going to email this

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.620
to the announcements
list later today.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.230
This Friday there is a free
conference workshop thing

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.310
going on at a hotel,
I think, in Boston.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.372
But it's being run by
Epic Games, about Unreal.

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:01.580
So they're going to do a
bunch of different workshops

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.400
from about 2:00 to 5:00 and
end the day with a networking

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.520
party.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119
So if you're interested in
using the Unreal engine and all

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.910
the different new things
about that engine,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.979
they'll be running that.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.390
They're also going to be on
campus Tuesday at 5:00 PM,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.710
so Tuesday, November 18.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.280
That can be found at
the GameLab website.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.980
And they'll be talking
about Blueprint, a way

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.690
to do scripting in Unreal that's
kind of similar to some things

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.067
I've seen for Unity, but
it's baked into Unreal.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.900
And if you used previous
versions of Unreal,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.980
I think it's related to Akismet,
if you used that tool before.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.470
Otherwise, upcoming guests
we have at the class that are

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.950
different from the syllabus-- on
Monday we're going to have two

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.265
writers and talking with Drew,
doing a little panel and then

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:52.810
a Q&A with y'all talking about
different ways of looking

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.760
at writing for games that I
think would be very directly

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.940
related to at least two of
the games that I've seen.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.820
Because yours was a very
dialogue-driven game, yeah?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.310
And then the Animal Crossing
kind of game, I imagine,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.809
would be really
useful for you all.

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.600
Probably useful for
the other two, as well,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.120
but those are the ones
that first came to my mind

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.960
when I was scheduling that one.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.194
And then on the 19th, we have
Blizzard coming in, right?

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:18.610
PROFESSOR 2: I
think that's right.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.790
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.470
So Wednesday night,
Blizzard's going to come in.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.093
And it's teams from
Heroes of the Storm?

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:27.092
PROFESSOR 2: I think so.

00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:27.592
But--

00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:29.967
PROFESSOR 1: But yeah, we're
not quite sure exactly who's

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:31.290
going to be there for that.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.206
But we talked to them.

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:36.010
And we requested either Heroes
of the Storm or Hearthstone.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.110
So one of those
groups, we'll begin

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.790
to talk about their
production process.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.600
And you can ask them
things about what

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.850
it's like to work at Blizzard.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.380
That's everything I've got.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.410
Yeah, so I'm going to bring
it over to-- you're wired?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.920
Cool.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.420
Great.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.800
PROFESSOR 2: So when I went
over to GDC Next just last week,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.210
I met Richard.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.060
Actually, he's been
to all that before.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.310
And he gave this
talk on game audio.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.869
And then I remembered,
wait a minute,

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.160
there's a talk on game audio
that's coming up in class.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.920
And I was just going to fake it.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.566
And then I heard his
talk and realized maybe

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:14.440
he should be the one
talking to you, instead.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.790
So I invited him
and Andy Forsberg,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.940
who's his partner
at Hexany Audio.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.670
Let's see.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.220
You'll see the name
of the company come up

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.990
in the next slide.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.390
And they do professional
sound design

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.200
and audio design and music.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.170
That includes things
like sound effects,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.740
as well as scoring and
also advising companies

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.790
on things like the technology
that they're using.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.248
And he's going to
talk a little bit

00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:41.830
about how to do good audio on a
budget, as well as just things

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.310
to think about in your audio
design of your own game.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.900
So I'm going to
hand it over to you.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.140
And thank you very much
for speaking today.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.470
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.180
Well, thanks so much.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.888
Happy to be here.

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:52.480
Just curious-- so the class,
I'm wondering, what level is it?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.130
Is it more
introductory, advanced?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.860
What's the focus?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.130
PROFESSOR 2: Intermediate.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.960
So they're making video games.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.309
But it's a class that
actually has prerequisites.

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.850
So they needed to take another
classes, either in game design

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.180
or in programming,
before they came here.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.971
RICHARD LUDLOW: OK.

00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:07.590
Cool, cool.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.240
So I'm just curious-- show
of hands, how many people

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.090
are planning to go
out into the world

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.040
after you graduate and
become game designers,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.060
game developers?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.560
Anyone?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.059
Anyone?

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:18.115
OK, cool, cool.

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:20.080
Nice.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.580
That's cool.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.454
ANDY FORSBERG: Sweet.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:22.174
No, very nice.

00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:23.090
RICHARD LUDLOW: Great.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.210
So yeah, we're going to
talk to you about music

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.950
and sound in games and then give
a little bit of very practical

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.916
advice about working
with composers

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.290
and working with
sound designers.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.371
And so that's the situation
most of you will probably be in.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.370
So we'll give you a little
overview of ourselves

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.110
in a second.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.901
But if you want to go
on to the next slide,

00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:47.280
we're going to talk
about three key areas.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.050
Yeah, we're just going
to tag team this.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.130
So the three things
we're going to talk about

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.694
are, number one, Interactivity.

00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:57.360
So we're going to
talk to you about what

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.860
makes game audio
different than film audio

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.740
and why you should
care about it.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.790
And then in
Agreements, we're going

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.880
to talk about contracts and what
that looks like for you hiring

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.330
a composer or a sound designer,
which is really most often

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.770
the case with an indy game.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.130
And then lastly, we'll talk
about money and budgets

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.030
and how much hiring one
of us audio guys takes.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.910
So a little bit about us--
I'm Richard Ludlow, again.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.090
And I'm the audio
director of our company.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.690
And Andy is the music director.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.580
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah we both went
to school in Boston, actually.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.371
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah,
just across the river

00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:36.610
over at Berkeley and did
their game audio thing.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.420
And now we started the
company Hexany Audio.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.830
And basically, music, sound,
and dialogue, as well as

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.265
implementation services are
what we do with our clients.

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:48.640
ANDY FORSBERG: And we're based
in Los Angeles, obviously.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.330
RICHARD LUDLOW:
Yeah, based in LA.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.360
And we have experience
working on larger AAA console

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.750
games, lots of mobile indie
things, so a really wide range.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.680
And we do film and
commercial media, as well.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.200
But our focus really is
on games and interactivity

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.580
and the technology
that drives that.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.740
So yeah, without
further ado, if you want

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.567
to jump ahead to The Basics.

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:16.900
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:23.240
So music in games is all
about the dynamic experience

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.660
and player input in the game
and how the music and sound

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.850
effects adapt around that.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.370
Obviously, it's much
different than linear media,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.410
such as film, TV, et cetera.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.225
When you watch a film,
that same explosion

00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:36.400
is going to happen in the
same point every time.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.040
So obviously, with games
we have to change that.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.390
Because games are different.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.950
We have to make it adaptive
to what's going on.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.190
So there's four major parts
to audio in a game usually.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.030
There's the music.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.890
There's the sound
and the dialogue.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.520
But the major part
of this, again,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.600
is the implementation
into the game.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.890
If we write amazing
music or sound effects

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.690
or we have the coolest
voiceover artists in the world

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.940
and we get them to do
that stuff for our game--

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.884
if we implement it incorrectly
or the developer doesn't

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:05.550
do such a great job
because there wasn't

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.360
a dialogue between
us, then all the stuff

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.140
on the left side,
those three things,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.570
almost don't even matter.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.320
So it's all about how
it gets put in the game,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.515
as well as how it's crafted.

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:17.140
RICHARD LUDLOW: And
we're going to talk

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.764
about that in the
Interactivity section

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.700
if you're like, what
is this implementation

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.240
witchcraft we speak of?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.270
ANDY FORSBERG: Exactly.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.780
RICHARD LUDLOW: Anyway.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.420
ANDY FORSBERG: Next slide?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.295
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:08:25.295 --> 00:08:27.559
So The Importance of
Audio-- really talking

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:29.350
about why you guys
should care about audio.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.287
Because so often you think,
OK, I've got this mobile game.

00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:33.620
I'm going to shut off the audio.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.500
Who cares about it?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.880
But the depth that it
adds is really important.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.574
And we'd just like to touch
on three key areas of why

00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:43.990
music and sound is so important
in games, if you want to--

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.823
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah.

00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:48.020
The first thing, obviously,
the emotional factor.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.440
And you can't get around that.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.340
With everything else,
basically, audio

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.710
goes straight to the
center of your brain

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.830
that controls that stuff.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.730
It just skips everything
else and stimulates that.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.920
So obviously, when
we were kids we

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.150
turned the music off of a
game or turned the music off

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.650
of a film, and we'd
realize that we

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.650
weren't having those
emotional responses that we

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.320
did when it was on.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.295
So obviously, emotion is
a huge part of what we do.

00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:18.170
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.470
And that's a chemical response.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.570
Like Andy said, it's
actually eliciting-- just

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.860
emphasize again-- a
chemical response.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.570
Visuals do not trigger these
emotional processing centers.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.280
It's sound and music.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.040
That's stimulating parts of
your brain that are different

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.920
and actually
creating the emotion.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
It's pretty amazing.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.930
At least we like to think
so. [LAUGHS] Anyway, cool.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.050
So the next one is Function.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.630
And this isn't a great term.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:52.100
But audio, it
supports the ability

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.570
for the player to really absorb
a lot of the game information.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.330
So when I say "function,"
it has the function

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.950
of giving you
information and also

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.134
the function of telling
you what's going on

00:10:03.134 --> 00:10:04.300
with regards to your action.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.460
So for example, you're
walking down a hallway.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:12.329
And there's a guy up ahead
that you hear maybe walking.

00:10:12.329 --> 00:10:14.120
And you know, OK,
there's a guard up ahead.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.240
And then maybe your oxygen
tank is running low.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.531
And you've got a little "beep."

00:10:17.531 --> 00:10:19.739
And your health is maybe at 50%.

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.780
Maybe there's an alarm
going off in the building.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.370
You hear a guy in the next room.

00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:27.800
You hear all these
different things.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.191
And all of that is information
that's being processed and sent

00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:31.690
to you.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.640
And you're able to
absorb it all instantly

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.550
without needing to think and see
text on the screen that says,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.720
oh, OK, I'm at 50% oxygen.
There's three enemies nearby.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.770
It's getting dark out
because I hear the crickets.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.580
This is just stuff that your
brain subconsciously absorbs.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.800
So it's functional
in that it provides

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.410
that information for players in
an entirely new dimension that

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.480
is subconscious to them.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.452
So you can convey lots of
subconscious information.

00:10:58.452 --> 00:10:59.410
ANDY FORSBERG: Exactly.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.020
RICHARD LUDLOW:
And then also, it's

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.640
that feel-good factor for games.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.690
So you punch a guy.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.640
Oh, well, hold up on that maybe.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.400
But yeah, you punch a guy.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.430
And it feels good in the game.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:18.680
And that is because of that
trigger, the sound meshing

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.860
with the psychological.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.530
Anyway, so the sounds
we were talking

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.613
about that are memorable--
I know you just played,

00:11:24.613 --> 00:11:26.570
what was that, the Zelda
sound or something?

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.430
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.280
RICHARD LUDLOW: I
couldn't quite hear.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.010
ANDY FORSBERG:
Yeah, it obviously

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.240
has to be memorable with
game audio, as well.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.760
And yeah, you played
the Zelda one.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.947
Think of the countdown
for Mario Kart

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.530
where it makes you want to hit
A really fast and get everyone,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.666
obviously-- but there's
countless examples.

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:45.290
We might have--

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.775
[VIDEO GAME SOUND]

00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:51.930
RICHARD LUDLOW: You
could just play them all.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.320
Just play them all.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.048
ANDY FORSBERG: Let's see.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.172
RICHARD LUDLOW: I'm not
sure if you've played them.

00:11:58.172 --> 00:11:59.255
But I'll just talk about--

00:11:59.255 --> 00:12:01.410
[COUNTDOWN SOUNDS]

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.720
So these are really
iconic sounds.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.770
And I think the Mario
coin sound is next.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.243
Let's see.

00:12:10.243 --> 00:12:11.720
[COIN SOUND]

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.930
So that sound has been in an
entire generation of games.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.650
And the Zelda sound,
when you hear that,

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.890
that's extremely
rewarding for the player.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.560
It's extremely memorable.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.710
Sound is burned into
a player's conscience

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.180
in a way that
doesn't necessarily

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.357
happen with visuals.

00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:31.940
You hear that. [SNAPS] And then
you hear the achievement sound

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.470
that we played.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.053
And it's like, oh,
I've unlocked that.

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:37.870
There's this stimulating
reward response.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.066
And so good sound and
bad sound is going

00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:41.190
to stick with your players.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.540
And it can really
help set that game

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.070
apart so that later
on the players

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.500
are remembering your game
in a very unique way.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.180
Anyway--

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.670
ANDY FORSBERG: Next slide.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.970
RICHARD LUDLOW: We'll move
on to the real stuff now.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.360
So Interactivity.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.630
That was kind of the preface.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.370
So the first section
that we talk about

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.030
is it that implementation
and how that works in games.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.460
And that interactivity
is a huge part of that.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.030
So if you want to jump
ahead to the next slide--

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.010
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.005
So on the music side of things,
obviously, if you want music

00:13:11.005 --> 00:13:14.270
that changes dynamically based
on what the player is doing,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.820
whether he's
walking into a field

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.650
and staying there for five
hours because he left it on

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.550
to go make a sandwich or
because he's walking in to buy

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.190
something from a shopkeeper.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.130
So how do we do that?

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.546
There are several
different things

00:13:25.546 --> 00:13:29.120
we can do, whether a player's
going into battle, et cetera.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.640
We can use one system called
layering, which Richard's going

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.910
to talk about in another slide.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.955
We're going to talk
about crossfading.

00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:38.330
And then we're going to give
you an example of branching,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.265
as well.

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:40.640
And then there's
also generative.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.681
And these are just a few.

00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:46.620
There are so many options that
we can use to implement music

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.005
in a cool, interactive way.

00:13:48.005 --> 00:13:48.880
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.809
So let's jump over to
one of the examples.

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:52.100
And go ahead and throw that up.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.900
Don't hit the Play
button quite yet.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.390
So you can hit the next slide.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.621
And it'll pop up the graph.

00:13:58.621 --> 00:13:59.120
All right.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.830
So what you're seeing here is
the idea of a layered score.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.140
So in this one, this is a piece
of music I wrote for a game

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.820
where there's three
different intensity layers.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.337
And you're going to hear a first
one that's very low intensity.

00:14:14.337 --> 00:14:16.670
And then you're going to hear
these other layers come in

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.010
on top as maybe the
player starts to go

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.210
into an area with enemies.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.010
And then they go into an
area where they're in battle.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.031
And you'll hear the music
stack in a very dynamic way.

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:29.280
Anyway, go ahead and hit play.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.289
Let's see.

00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:34.201
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:35.668
So that low intensity.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.778
Players done some [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.490
The second layer's
going to come in on top.

00:14:56.945 --> 00:15:00.410
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.300
You hear all three
layers, though, I think.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.164
Back to just the first two.

00:15:19.164 --> 00:15:20.330
And then just the first one.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.670
So you can see this as well.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.510
You could hear the layers fading
out in and between one another.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.340
But it was a very
dynamic experience.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.150
So this is where
we'd take the music,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.540
and we'd specifically
craft it and write it

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.940
so that these things could stack
and be triggered dynamically

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.690
based on whatever
the player is doing.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.517
So let's jump ahead
to the next slide.

00:15:39.517 --> 00:15:41.100
So this is one more
example-- and this

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.030
is the last one we'll
show you for music--

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.130
that deals with the way that
music can move dynamically

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.170
between states again.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.610
So yeah, so we've got
the low, medium, high.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.580
But this time,
we've broken it out

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.580
into smaller, little chunks.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.220
So the player will do something.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.820
And the musical will actually
wait until the musical point,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.720
like the next bar or beat.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.100
And then it will begin
a transitional segment

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.862
into the next level intensities.

00:16:06.862 --> 00:16:09.070
And this is going to be a
much more dynamic and fluid

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.520
experience than the layering.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.730
So go ahead and hit Play.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.940
[AMBIENT MUSIC]

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.090
Low intensity, again.

00:16:27.414 --> 00:16:29.020
So a player's going
to do something.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.406
And it's going to come
in with the transition.

00:16:31.406 --> 00:16:32.720
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.324
Transition.

00:16:34.324 --> 00:16:37.803
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:44.264
Now we're going
to go into medium.

00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:45.258
We're in medium.

00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:57.683
The player's going
to do something.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.808
And the music's going to
wait to do the transition.

00:17:02.653 --> 00:17:04.144
Transition.

00:17:04.144 --> 00:17:07.126
[MUSIC CHANGES]

00:17:10.108 --> 00:17:14.084
Now it's running the high.

00:17:14.084 --> 00:17:17.563
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.006
The music's going to wait and
then go into the transition.

00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:40.950
And back to low.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.450
Cool.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.210
So you saw the music move
through-- one, two, three,

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.695
four-- six different
pieces there.

00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:49.180
But it sounded like the
experience was being scored.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.870
So again, the idea here is
we're trying to-- again,

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.200
with the film, you watch it.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.700
It goes by.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.600
You know what's going to happen.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.725
We don't know what's going
to happen with the game.

00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:59.380
So we write music that
can change and adapt

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.530
like that, in a
very film-like way

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.090
to score the player experience.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.407
So why do we do this?

00:18:06.407 --> 00:18:08.740
ANDY FORSBERG: So obviously,
it creates a more immersive

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.400
and dynamic player experience.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.010
Any time we are
taking you guys out

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.240
of that escapist experience,
we're not doing our job.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.630
It extends track
longevity, which

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.840
we'll explain later with budgets
why that's nice, as well.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.190
But you get better
replay value out of it.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.280
And it's the greatest value
from each individual minute

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.125
of music.

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:32.682
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah, instead
of having to hire someone

00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:34.390
to write three different
pieces of music,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.034
if you're on a
budget, you can say,

00:18:36.034 --> 00:18:37.200
we'll do one piece of music.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.335
And we'll make it layered.

00:18:38.335 --> 00:18:39.960
And it'll be one
better piece of music.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.918
ANDY FORSBERG: Exactly.

00:18:40.918 --> 00:18:44.674
Because if a movie
is 90 minutes long

00:18:44.674 --> 00:18:46.090
and they want 60
minutes of music,

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.690
you write 60 minutes of music.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.840
One small mobile game could
have 15 minutes of music.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.430
Or it could have one minute
of music or three minutes.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.180
So it all depends.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.055
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:57.190
And that goes into-- we'll
talk about with budgets

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.910
how that affects that.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.980
But so yeah, jumping
onto the next slide,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.500
how do we do these
interactive systems?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.930
We build them with what
we call audio middleware.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.410
And two of the commercial ones
are FMOD, that you see here.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.810
And if you want to jump ahead
to the next one-- Wwise.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.610
And these are just screenshots.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:18.010
And essentially, these allow us
to interface with programmers

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.050
and set up these musical
triggers and these points

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.500
of musical change based
on different parameters,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.870
like number of enemies around
or game state or health,

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.340
and let us set up these
musical transitions

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.730
and things like that.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.650
So yeah, we can jump
onto the next section.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.425
Agreements.

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:39.337
So you've learned all
about interactivity.

00:19:39.337 --> 00:19:40.920
And you're like,
yes, this is awesome.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.339
I'm going to hire
a game composer

00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:43.630
so that they can do this stuff.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.560
And then with
music, though, it's

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.870
obviously a creative
piece of content.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.750
So the agreements look
a little different

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.100
sometimes than other agreements.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.700
And so we're going to show
you three different kinds.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.533
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah.

00:19:57.533 --> 00:19:59.050
So the purposes
of these contracts

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.210
are, obviously, to see
who owns it, obviously,

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.650
first and foremost.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.236
What we're going to
be delivering to you.

00:20:06.236 --> 00:20:09.120
What the delivery milestones
are in a game just as

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.012
there's development milestones.

00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:12.470
How much you guys
are paying, which

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.670
is super important
for you and us.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.140
And what's your
rights as a developer?

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.210
Where can you use it?

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.350
Can you go around and
license it to use it

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.500
in all the things involved
with your project or no?

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.360
And what are our usage rights?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.420
Can we use it in our portfolio,
on our Facebook page?

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.214
Can we do that sort of thing?

00:20:31.214 --> 00:20:33.505
So we're just going to go
through a few of the contract

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:34.550
types here.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:34.740
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.150
And it's really important to
spell out all those things.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.720
So yeah, let's look
at the first one.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.030
Work for Hire.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.890
This is the most common
type of agreement

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.380
that you run into
with composers.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.690
And it's essentially
where I'm the composer,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.530
I've written music, and I am
selling you my music or sound.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.720
You're buying it from me.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.910
And you're taking all the
rights for it as a developer.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:59.050
You become the owners
of the music and sound.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.520
And so you've got the
rights associated with it.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.740
And because you have the
rights, the developer then

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.180
can usually use
the audio however

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.250
they want in the project.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.740
Because you own it.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.410
You've also got the exclusive
right to use the audio,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.506
meaning you're the only
ones that can use it.

00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:15.380
I can't go around and
turn around and sell it

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.940
to Bob or Joe over there.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.880
You've bought it.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.900
It's yours.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.910
And then lastly-- this
is the disadvantage

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.860
for developers-- is that this
is a more expensive agreement.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.860
Because you are buying
out all of our rights.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.720
And I'm going to show in
detail in a few slides

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.460
some important clauses to be
aware of in these contracts.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.710
But yeah, so let's talk about on
the other end of the spectrum.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.430
We've got work for hire, where
you and me-- the composer

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.850
selling the developer my rights.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.434
And then on the other end of the
spectrum, we've got licenses.

00:21:45.434 --> 00:21:46.308
ANDY FORSBERG: Right.

00:21:46.308 --> 00:21:47.870
So we have two
sorts of licenses.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.370
The first we'll talk about
is the non-exclusive.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.500
So this means that
we are retaining

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500
the rights of the music,
sound effects, anything

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.480
we do for your project.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.950
We could go around and turn
it to another game, et cetera.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.900
However, don't be
afraid of these.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.900
We're writing the
same custom music

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.690
for your game, which is
super important to remember.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.230
You're getting the
same exact product.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.900
It's obviously a lot cheaper.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.870
And it's a great way to save
yourself some money when

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.290
working with people like us.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.210
And again, you can
still have unrestricted

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.730
use of the audio in your
project and things involved

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.740
with that usually.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.650
But again, we could turn around
and use this for whatever we

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.940
would like to use it for.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.540
So yeah, those are
the main reasons--

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.680
RICHARD LUDLOW: And we use this
negotiating with developers

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.267
all the time.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.350
So if they don't want to
buy out all of our rights

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.225
and pay that full price,
we'll say, OK, well,

00:22:35.225 --> 00:22:37.634
we'll retain the right to
go sell it to Bob and Joe

00:22:37.634 --> 00:22:39.050
and still give you
the same music.

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:42.810
ANDY FORSBERG: And then
we have, obviously,

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:48.480
the exclusive license,
which is you're going

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.370
to retain all of the rights.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.850
But it's usually for a
certain amount of time.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.280
And then those rights
transfer back to us.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.430
And sometimes it's
industry-specific.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.609
So we might be able to use that
audio in a trailer or a film

00:23:02.609 --> 00:23:03.150
or something.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.000
However, pertaining to the game
or anything in the game world,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.114
we're not going to turn
around and license that

00:23:08.114 --> 00:23:08.780
to someone else.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.460
Usually this lasts
about one to five years.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.320
We like to call this
the happy medium

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.940
between the work for hire and
the non-exclusive license.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.650
And it really is a healthy
balance of price and control.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.440
Because it's right in the middle
as far as price is concerned.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.020
And everyone's happy.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.170
You guys could use
it for what you need.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.335
But then we also get those
rights back. eventually.

00:23:31.335 --> 00:23:32.210
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.540
So work for hire--
I make the music.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.260
I'm the composer.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.180
I sell it to you.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.220
You get all the rights.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.960
Non-exclusive--
I'm the composer.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.040
I make the music.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040
I retain all the rights.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.456
And I can sell it
to other people.

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:44.420
With exclusive,
I'm the composer.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.277
I make the music.

00:23:45.277 --> 00:23:46.110
I retain the rights.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.370
But I give you the
exclusive right to it.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.010
So I can't sell
it to anyone else.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.630
And then it usually
reverts back to us

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.750
after a brief
time, as discussed.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.211
So most common, though,
is the work for hire.

00:23:58.211 --> 00:24:00.710
And you're seeing that contract,
and you're like, oh my god.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.293
This is awful.

00:24:01.293 --> 00:24:02.770
I don't want to see this.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.680
But anyway, let's jump
through that really quick

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.250
and just a few key points
that really go to developers

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.200
helping protect themselves.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.437
And I've got to hit Play
over here on my key notes

00:24:15.437 --> 00:24:17.520
so that I can see all the
different slide changes.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.330
One second.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.090
OK, cool.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.610
So the first thing is services.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.460
It's like, what are you paying
for music, sound, dialogue?

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.570
What are you buying?

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.653
This will be really quick.

00:24:28.653 --> 00:24:31.630
Jumping onto the next one,
so payment for services--

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.800
what are you getting paid?

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.140
You want to spell out exactly
how much you're going to charge

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.116
and how much you're going to
pay for the music and sound.

00:24:41.116 --> 00:24:43.490
Next point, and this is the
independent contractor point.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.530
That's important for
you as a developer.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.620
Because this essentially says
that the composer or sound

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.570
designer you're hiring
is not on salary

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.390
and does not need benefits.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.510
They have to take care
of their own taxes.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.030
It just protects the developers.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.100
So they make
everything clear there.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.310
Next, warranties.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.890
These are things, again, that
protect you, as the developer.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.700
So this says, OK, the music
we're writing, its original.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.870
We're not stealing John
Williams' music, as I always

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.130
say.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.780
ANDY FORSBERG:
[HUMMING] score game.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.740
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yes,
right. [CHUCKLES]

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.536
But then if we do steal it--
and we're not going to steal it.

00:25:20.536 --> 00:25:22.410
And there are some other
warranties, as well.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.970
But we'll jump onto
the indemnification.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.940
So then it usually says, if we
do steal John Williams' music,

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.050
you guys are protected.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.280
And there's different
levels of indemnification.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.170
But the indemnification
just says

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.180
it falls on us if
we screw things up.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.800
Next, there's usually a little
confidential information

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.930
clause, a little NDA clause
about not disclosing things

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.760
and then some specific legal
language about the ownership

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.981
and assignment of rights
specific to work-for-hire,

00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:52.730
legal mumbo-jumbo.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.000
We'll skip the subcontract.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.580
And then there are some rights
that are specific to us,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.790
as the content creators.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.160
So if you remember, we talked
about composer-specific rights,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.730
things like the ability
for us to post our work

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.360
on our website, something
that we like in our contract

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.310
so that we can advertise music
to other people [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.360
them to hire us.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.140
Similarly, we often spell out
how we're going to be credited.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.720
And the credit is a
great way, as well,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.740
to negotiate with your composer.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.860
If you're on a budget,
maybe you say, OK, I'll

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.360
put your name at the
opening cinematic

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.980
instead of just in the
back to help compensate

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.220
for our lack of budget,
get you a little more

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.820
exposure, things like that.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.280
So you spell out how
you want to be credited.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.857
That's really it
for the contract.

00:26:42.857 --> 00:26:44.440
I don't want to go
too detailed there.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.846
But some key points
to be thinking about

00:26:46.846 --> 00:26:51.450
if you guys ever hire a
composer or a sound designer.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.090
Let's talk about money.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.360
This is the question
most people have.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.890
And whenever I meet a
developer, without fail,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.280
within like 10 minutes of the
conversation, they're like,

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.900
ah, what do you charge?

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.630
ANDY FORSBERG: What's generally
what you charge for any game?

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.910
RICHARD LUDLOW: It's funny.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.942
And I gave this
talk at GDC Next.

00:27:09.942 --> 00:27:11.400
And you'll see by
the end of it why

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.430
I'm like, that's not a
question I can just answer.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.420
And then I got like
three emails from people

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.490
who attended the talk
after and who were like,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.074
can you just give me a
range for an indie budget?

00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:23.240
Anyway, but you'll see why
that's funny in a minute.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.542
Because my response is
always to them when they ask,

00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:26.500
how much do you charge?

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.820
My response is always,
what's your budget?

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.642
And the reason being
because are so many factors,

00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:37.430
like what the deadline
is, musical style,

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.880
whether or not we're talking
about a solo piano piece

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.280
versus epic orchestral piece.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.238
ANDY FORSBERG: Are we
going to get live players

00:27:43.238 --> 00:27:45.967
to play those orchestral
pieces or a piano player

00:27:45.967 --> 00:27:47.160
to play that song, maybe.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.820
RICHARD LUDLOW: You can
throw out the bullet points

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.020
if you want, just FYI.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.410
We're just going through them.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.500
Anyway, and what's
the release platform?

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.700
Is this the AAA console?

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.620
Or is it a Facebook game for
the American Cancer Society?

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.465
ANDY FORSBERG:
Again, are we going

00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:01.750
to use a work-for-hire or
what one of the license deals?

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:02.666
RICHARD LUDLOW: Right.

00:28:02.666 --> 00:28:05.079
Like we just talked about,
buying out the rights or us

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:05.870
keeping the rights?

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.770
Really big effect
on the price there.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:09.770
How much are you buying?

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.210
We're like Costco.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.450
ANDY FORSBERG: But if you're
going to buy 100 sound effects,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.533
that's obviously going to
be different than if you

00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:18.395
need five sound effects
or 50 sound effects.

00:28:18.395 --> 00:28:20.090
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah, we give
bulk discounts all the time.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.480
ANDY FORSBERG: Exactly.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.230
And that goes into,
obviously, the depth

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.890
of the audio
experience, as well,

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.505
which is how crazy we're going
to get with interactivity,

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:29.904
if we're going to
be using middleware.

00:28:29.904 --> 00:28:32.070
RICHARD LUDLOW: Like Andy
said with the mobile game,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.220
you could put one minute,
three minutes, 10 minutes, 20

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.320
minutes, all in the same game.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.740
It's going to be a better
game if you've got-- maybe

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.490
you don't need 20.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.739
But if you've got more
than one looping track,

00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:44.030
it's going to be a better game.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.180
But the game still exists
with a single piece of music.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.620
So saying, how
much do you charge,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.080
is a very, very
difficult question

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.270
to answer without knowing--

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:53.780
ANDY FORSBERG: Any stipulations.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.404
RICHARD LUDLOW: --more
about your game.

00:28:55.404 --> 00:28:56.090
Yeah.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.370
ANDY FORSBERG:
One of our clients

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.830
that we work with, on their page
where you go to contact them,

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.210
it says, when do you need
your project done by?

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.046
And one of the
options is, Yesterday.

00:29:06.046 --> 00:29:06.920
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.660
And deadlines are a
huge part of that.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.410
Sometimes we get
calls where it's

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.180
like, we need this in
two days or in a day.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.860
And we'll do it.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.790
But it's going to cost more
than if you need it in a year.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.550
So contacting, guys,
early is important.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.529
Anyway, let's jump
on to payment models.

00:29:25.529 --> 00:29:28.070
ANDY FORSBERG: And you can hit
all these bullet points again.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.220
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah,
I mean, we were just

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.660
basically talking about
how composers and sound

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.970
designers charge.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.280
Typically with music, it's
a per-minute music, so not

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.975
per minute that we're working.

00:29:39.975 --> 00:29:41.600
ANDY FORSBERG: And
then sound effects--

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.410
yeah, that we're working-- and
then sound effects are usually

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.394
per-asset.

00:29:46.394 --> 00:29:48.060
RICHARD LUDLOW: Or
sometimes a flat fee.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.240
That's also common
[INAUDIBLE] quote a project

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.970
and say, OK, I'll do
your whole project

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.302
regardless of how many sound
effects for, you know, $20,000.

00:29:55.302 --> 00:29:56.260
I don't know, whatever.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.990
ANDY FORSBERG:
Sometimes hourly rate.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.260
We usually don't do this.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.242
This is a really
hard one to engage.

00:30:00.242 --> 00:30:01.700
RICHARD LUDLOW:
It's a valid thing.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.240
People do it.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.730
We don't.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.280
ANDY FORSBERG: We don't.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.490
RICHARD LUDLOW: But yeah.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.140
[KNOCKING SOUNDS]

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.450
There's some weird thing
happening below us.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.910
ANDY FORSBERG: Sorry.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:16.020
And then usually, we really like
to get back-end profit sharing.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.770
RICHARD LUDLOW: If the
budget isn't there.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.930
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah, that's
a big thing with audio

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.000
to think about.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.570
At the end of the
day, is it really

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.840
going to cost you that much to
give 0.5% of back-end when you

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.270
can't give anything up front?

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.967
Because we always
have passion projects.

00:30:30.967 --> 00:30:32.550
We make money on
some of our projects.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.420
But we really like to believe
in games that are really cool.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.120
And sometimes the best to do
that is just to share the game.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.360
RICHARD LUDLOW: The
indie scene, they often

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.180
can't afford because they
don't have that upfront money.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.290
And so we'll talk about
a back-end profit sharing

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.110
percentage.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.950
And if you talk to people who
have been doing this 30 years,

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:52.130
that didn't exist
10, 20, 30 years ago.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.620
Audio guys did not get back-end
profit sharing usually.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.520
Because they were
just paid upfront.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.820
But that's kind of gone away.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.740
I guess that is probably
true of all industries.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.610
But so thinking about that
is a very valid thing.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:12.200
And it's usually accompanied
by some upfront fee.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.780
It's usually a reduced amount.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.590
But the back-end thing
is definitely valid.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.950
We want new developers
to be less afraid of that

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.160
and more open to it.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.832
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:22.832 --> 00:31:25.290
RICHARD LUDLOW: And then any
combination of the above, too.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:25.790
Cool.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.960
Anyway, so how does
this break down?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.880
And you can throw
all these up here.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.086
Just showing you music,
sound, and dialogue.

00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:35.460
There's a lot of
components here.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.940
So when we're talking
about what we're charging,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.260
we charge different prices
for themes in the music.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.966
So if I write a musical
theme that has its setting,

00:31:46.966 --> 00:31:48.340
and we charge one
price for that.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.070
But then we might
put an arrangement

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.980
of that in an underwater level,
a desert level, a jungle level.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.740
The same theme, but
different arrangements

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.850
for different levels.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.250
And we charge less for
those arrangements.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.710
Those little
transitional segments

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.940
you've heard in that demo I
played, those are transitions.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.650
We charge less for those.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.430
And any different price
for things like stingers,

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.780
like a coin pick-up
or an end game,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.230
like, [HUMMING] sound
like that when you die.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.960
With sound effects, we break
things out into primary sound

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.670
effects, like if you've got
a creature having an attack

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.910
sound, "ch."

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.450
And then it's like a
die sound, idle sound,

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.950
those are all primary sounds.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:33.500
Iterations might be like,
attack01, attack02, attack03,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.890
die01, die02.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.730
And we charge less
for iterations.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.110
UI and ambiences,
different prices there.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.790
And then dialogue, there's just
a whole slew of components,

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.640
like casting.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.350
Usually you have to hire
someone to cast all the actors.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.440
ANDY FORSBERG:
Getting Kevin Spacey

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.940
for the next Call of Duty game.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.910
Or where--

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.960
RICHARD LUDLOW: Kevin
Spacey for the next--

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.580
ANDY FORSBERG: --we're
doing it ourselves.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.199
RICHARD LUDLOW: Who doesn't
want to use Kevin Spacey?

00:32:57.199 --> 00:32:57.740
You're right.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.630
And then so they
charge a few hundred,

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.167
a few thousand an hour,
depending on the actor.

00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:03.750
Usually there's
someone directing them

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.290
while they're being recorded.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.566
Someone's recording them,
editing them, processing.

00:33:08.566 --> 00:33:09.940
Just throwing this
up here so you

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.599
know all the different
components of music-sound

00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:13.390
that are out there.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.420
So again, asking,
what do you charge,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.940
what does your game
need, is a very--

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.977
we need to know what your
game needs before we can say.

00:33:21.977 --> 00:33:23.310
ANDY FORSBERG: Cool, next slide.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.355
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:33:24.355 --> 00:33:25.980
So we're getting
close to the end here.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.230
Then we can do some questions.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.000
But just talking about
a theoretical project--

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.160
say you've got a low budget,
$160,000 Kickstarter project.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.070
So talking about
music-sound, we're

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.510
typically looking
at like 5% to 15%

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.790
of budget being
allocated to audio.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.622
5% to 15%, usually
hovering around 10, 15, 20,

00:33:48.622 --> 00:33:50.470
25-- very good.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.150
ANDY FORSBERG: 100! [LAUGHS]

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.810
RICHARD LUDLOW:
No, but seriously.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.340
And so a common
problem with this,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.770
though, is that your game, to be
awesome, needs this much music.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.270
But your budget is only going
to allow for this much music.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.639
So let's say we've got
a hypothetical game here

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.360
where a project might need
18 minutes of music and 300

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.590
sound effects.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.540
So say we were going to
charge like $750 a minute

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.420
for themes and $500 a
minute for arrangements,

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.030
which are kind of indie prices.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:25.150
We charge up to-- we have
a different scale because

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.940
of all the different
factors involved--

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.000
but up to like $1,000 a
minute is pretty typical.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.330
The big guys on AAA's will
be charging $2,500 a minute.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.219
But up to $1,000
a minute of music

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:41.040
is pretty typical,
between $500 and $1,000.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.659
And then maybe sound effects.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:46.690
Maybe you use a combination
of all those, total $12,500.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.230
Let's say this game,
to be awesome, again,

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.110
needs $23,500 for the audio.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.930
And you're like, oh my
god, that's a lot of money.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:56.429
And let's say the
developer has only

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.076
allocated $11,000 to audio.

00:34:58.076 --> 00:34:58.950
ANDY FORSBERG: Right.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.580
So some things we can do to
reduce the costs are-- we

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.990
can reduce the
original music themes

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.619
and increase the arrangements.

00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:07.160
So we can just do
a lot of iterations

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.017
with things, which is actually
a very feasible option,

00:35:10.017 --> 00:35:12.842
because those composers
were trained to do that.

00:35:12.842 --> 00:35:15.050
We can reduce the number of
sound effects iterations,

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.360
just have more of
those primaries.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.590
RICHARD LUDLOW: Only attack01
instead of 02, 03, 04.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.600
ANDY FORSBERG: Exactly.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.142
We can do back-end
profit sharing,

00:35:21.142 --> 00:35:22.100
as we mentioned before.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.765
So maybe at 3% on that.

00:35:23.765 --> 00:35:25.390
And then we can use
a license agreement

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.600
instead of saying you're
using the work-for-hire.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.280
RICHARD LUDLOW: So just some
common things to think about

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.860
in that negotiating
process about,

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.860
how can we work
with the audio guy

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.800
to reduce the cost to something
we're both comfortable with?

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.500
Yeah, so let's just
wrap up really quick.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.190
What did we talk about?

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.600
Interactivity.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.660
It's music.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.690
It's sound.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.460
It's responding dynamically
to player input.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.600
The player does something.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.450
The music, the sound,
it changes, it reacts.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.480
It's going to create a
deeper player experience.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.510
It's going to reduce the
cost if you do it right.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.740
And we're doing this
with FMOD, Wwise, Fabric,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.730
different audio middleware.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.480
ANDY FORSBERG: And
then for budgets, we're

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.590
trying to look at 5% to 15% of
the total budget of your game

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.760
allocated to audio.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.644
Remember to consider
back-end payments.

00:36:13.644 --> 00:36:15.060
We really think
that's going to be

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.780
part of the future of how
audio works within, especially,

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.770
the indie market.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.400
And just be willing to
negotiate and figure things out.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.680
Your costs fluctuate.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.110
Our costs fluctuate.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.030
So it just needs to
be a negotiation.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.530
We can usually
figure something out.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.770
Any audio person can.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.280
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.980
Oh, and then we jumped
over Agreements.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.500
ANDY FORSBERG: Oh, sorry.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.416
I went right and down.

00:36:34.416 --> 00:36:37.144
RICHARD LUDLOW: No,
it's cool It's all good.

00:36:37.144 --> 00:36:38.560
And then, agreements,
again, we're

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.352
talking about work-for-hire.

00:36:40.352 --> 00:36:41.060
I'm the composer.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.976
I'm writing the music.

00:36:41.976 --> 00:36:44.150
You, as the developer,
are buying it.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.360
Licenses-- I'm the composer.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.170
I write the music.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.400
I obtain the rights.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.653
And then I give you some type
of license to use the music.

00:36:51.653 --> 00:36:55.150
But that wraps up, I
think, the four points

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.960
we were going to talk about.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.610
If you guys have
specific questions,

00:36:58.610 --> 00:36:59.900
we're happy to answer them.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.180
Or Phil, if you have
any additional points

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.765
you want to touch on.

00:37:06.765 --> 00:37:10.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:11.181 --> 00:37:12.056
ANDY FORSBERG: Thanks

00:37:12.056 --> 00:37:13.018
RICHARD LUDLOW: Thanks.

00:37:13.018 --> 00:37:14.476
PROFESSOR 2: I
think for questions,

00:37:14.476 --> 00:37:16.410
if anyone has any
questions, I'll

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.730
repeat it since I'm a little
bit closer to the mic.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.640
Although, maybe the
mic might pick you up

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.230
if you're in the
back of the room.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.540
We'll give it a shot.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.810
RICHARD LUDLOW: It doesn't need
to be a question about what

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.920
we talked about, too.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.970
Any audio related things.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.990
ANDY FORSBERG: Favorite color.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.798
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah,
as loud as you can.

00:37:31.798 --> 00:37:32.714
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.255
PROFESSOR 2: Did
you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:50.255 --> 00:37:51.380
RICHARD LUDLOW: I think so.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.540
So was the gist of
it basically being

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.390
folks using music and sound and
then getting takedown notices?

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.422
Is that what she said?

00:37:58.422 --> 00:37:59.880
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah,
takedown notices

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.380
on some of those by
YouTube or Twitch.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.755
RICHARD LUDLOW:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:04.330
So the whole
takedown notice thing

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.620
has really come about because
people are just using the music

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.860
or just using the sound without
asking for permission for it.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.890
Now, in an actual
gameplay video,

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.510
if you're streaming
Twitch, that is really

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.530
a very developer-specific
question.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.510
And that's not something that
we, as the composers and sound

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.010
designers, really even
have control over.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.530
If it's for a game
and if it's in a game,

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.840
if we're working on a Nintendo
game and it goes out to them,

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.340
then that is owned by Nintendo.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.150
And if it's not
owned by Nintendo,

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.540
they've got the license for it.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.590
So it's all on them
with regards to that.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.660
So some developers are
totally cool letting it slide.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.670
Some developers are not.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.945
But it's a shifting-- it's all
being figured out right now.

00:38:46.945 --> 00:38:49.070
ANDY FORSBERG: And usually
that happens, obviously,

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.530
in the bigger game world.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.030
The biggest game
that would probably

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.530
happen with in the
indie world would

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.660
be something like Journey,
or something like that.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.450
RICHARD LUDLOW: And most
often, at least now, developers

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.660
are pretty cool with it.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.180
But I know it's all being
figured out right now.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.629
That's a very
shifting landscape.

00:39:06.629 --> 00:39:09.170
ANDY FORSBERG: And it has to do
with royalties in music and--

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.832
RICHARD LUDLOW:
That's another thing.

00:39:11.832 --> 00:39:14.290
ANDY FORSBERG: Collections have
been set up for film and TV

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.945
for eons now.

00:39:15.945 --> 00:39:17.570
And there's a system
in place for that.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.487
But there's really no
landscape for games yet.

00:39:19.487 --> 00:39:21.695
RICHARD LUDLOW: It's a little
different with YouTube,

00:39:21.695 --> 00:39:23.170
and the Twitch, as well.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.460
We get paid 0.0001 cents
every time someone will

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.060
watch something on YouTube.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.000
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah,
it's insulting.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.040
RICHARD LUDLOW: In
five years, hopefully,

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.248
that will all be figured out.

00:39:32.248 --> 00:39:35.070
But sorry I don't
have a better answer.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.227
our fault. It's the developer.

00:39:37.227 --> 00:39:38.810
PROFESSOR 2: Just a
follow up question

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.720
on that-- it seems like in
order for all these services

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.790
to actually detect that
they're using the music,

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.810
they need to cross check
it against some sort

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.100
of audio database.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.970
So is that something that
you, as composers, usually

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:51.720
end up submitting?

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.480
Or is that something that
the game companies usually

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.130
end up doing?

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.171
Or does it really depend
on the license agreement

00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:59.120
that you have with the company?

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.125
ANDY FORSBERG: It's
usually the developer.

00:40:01.125 --> 00:40:02.000
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.750
So there's a couple
different ways.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.210
We have friends who
work for PlayStation.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.160
And they were just
talking about how

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.950
they posted things on their
PlayStation North America

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.450
account.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:17.000
And they got taken down by
PlayStation Japan or something.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.680
So their own companies
aren't even really

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.590
able to quite mesh
this together yet.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:27.580
But the databases are sometimes
internal to publishers.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.860
But also sometimes
they're scanning surfaces

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.230
that these royalties
agencies like BMI and ASCAP

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.934
actually have.

00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:38.350
And they've got these automatic
scannings that are set up.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.660
And that sometimes comes about
because we submit our music

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.250
to these royalty agencies
like ASCAP and BMI

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.920
in order to be able to get paid.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.329
But then they use them to
find out how many times things

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:50.120
are getting played.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.062
They don't use them to figure
out what should be taken down.

00:40:53.062 --> 00:40:54.020
ANDY FORSBERG: Exactly.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.999
Yeah, I think, especially
on the indie level,

00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:00.040
the only way we would be
able to detect something

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.040
is if we went and
watched a YouTube video,

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.010
our music was in it, and
we're like, oh, crap!

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.820
That's our music.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.220
RICHARD LUDLOW: We don't
have these engines going.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.700
The publishers have teams
of people doing takedowns

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.739
on their content.

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:13.780
ANDY FORSBERG: Yay, team.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.150
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah, and I
don't know all the details

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.780
behind that.

00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:22.040
ANDY FORSBERG: Sorry?

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.623
RICHARD LUDLOW: The
ASCAP stands for--

00:41:23.623 --> 00:41:28.650
BOTH: American Society of
Composers and Publishers?

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.880
RICHARD LUDLOW: I want
to say Publishers.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.730
I think they probably should.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.530
I don't know, man.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.905
We just get the
checks from them.

00:41:36.905 --> 00:41:40.400
ANDY FORSBERG: BMI is
Broadcast Music, Incorporated.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.150
PROFESSOR 2: So I can
take a look at that.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.270
ANDY FORSBERG:
They're called PRO's.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.650
RICHARD LUDLOW: Composers,
Authors, and Publishers.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.230
PROFESSOR 2: Next one?

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.130
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yes.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:48.830
PROFESSOR 2: Other questions?

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.748
Yeah, Liz?

00:41:49.748 --> 00:41:53.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
art talk of last class,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.900
they have done an artist test
to see if the particular artists

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.880
are right for the game.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.782
Is there an
equivalent for music?

00:42:00.782 --> 00:42:02.115
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:02.115 --> 00:42:04.073
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah, we
do those all the time.

00:42:04.073 --> 00:42:06.930
And that's a totally legitimate
thing if you aren't sure.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:12.360
Asking them to do
a 30-second demo.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.921
I'd say a 30-second demo
is totally legitimate.

00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:19.420
Yeah, and usually the best way
to do that, guys, just so you

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.390
know, take some gameplay,
be it from your game,

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.390
a different game, concept
art for your game,

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:29.360
take some visuals as a
video, send it to them.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.260
Or just concept art,
send it to them.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.485
And let them work with that.

00:42:32.485 --> 00:42:33.985
ANDY FORSBERG:
Because we could even

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:36.140
do an interactive demo
for it at that point.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.120
The big thing, again, is
there's the difference

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.930
between being able
to write good music

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.660
and having a core concept
for a game from the beginning

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.030
and thinking about interactivity
when you're composing and doing

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.880
sound effects.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.555
Because it's a whole
different animal.

00:42:48.555 --> 00:42:49.430
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yeah.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.820
But the demos are
totally legitimate.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.860
We do them all the time.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.380
But sending some
visuals along is

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.970
very important to making
sure you get what you want.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.652
And then we're able to
see what the game is

00:43:01.652 --> 00:43:03.610
going to look like and
then make that decision.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.068
Otherwise, we might
write something

00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:08.930
that you might not have
the vision for because we

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:09.860
haven't seen the art.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.390
And maybe we could easily
do what you wanted,

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.320
but we just misinterpreted it
and went a different direction.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.612
But yeah, tests are
legitimate, absolutely.

00:43:18.612 --> 00:43:19.570
PROFESSOR 2: Questions?

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.660
AUDIENCE: How much are they
paid for the music test?

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.152
PROFESSOR 2: Will you be
paid for an audio test?

00:43:26.152 --> 00:43:27.860
RICHARD LUDLOW: What
did the art guy say?

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.844
I'm curious.

00:43:28.844 --> 00:43:30.177
AUDIENCE: They said [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:40.202 --> 00:43:42.410
ANDY FORSBERG: We have not
found that to be extremely

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:43.430
common with what we do.

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.620
We'd like it to be more common.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.950
RICHARD LUDLOW: It
used to be a thing.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:47.990
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah, it
used to be a huge thing.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.700
RICHARD LUDLOW: For
commercials, it was a big thing.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.180
You'd get paid for doing a demo.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.860
ANDY FORSBERG: I
think it's definitely

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.110
more common in the game world.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:54.950
In the film and TV
world, it's so saturated

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.570
with composers and
sound designers

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.380
right now that
they don't need to.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.360
Because so many
people want the work.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.390
But it is a respectful
thing to do,

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.195
I think if it's a longer demo.

00:44:06.195 --> 00:44:07.820
If it's a shorter
demo, then it's like,

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.550
we're happy to get the gig.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.740
RICHARD LUDLOW: We're going
to keep the rights to that,

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.240
anyway.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.840
So you could say a couple
hundred bucks maybe.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.030
But it's not a required thing.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.160
If we want the gig, we're
happy to do a 30-second demo

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.471
to try and get it often.

00:44:21.471 --> 00:44:23.220
It's nice to throw a
couple hundred bucks.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.550
But at that point, it's
a couple hundred bucks.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:32.700
It's not like-- it's pennies
in the grand scheme of things

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.070
if the project is larger.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.842
So yeah, anyway,
hopefully that solves it.

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:39.550
PROFESSOR 2: Yes.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.043
RICHARD LUDLOW: Any more?

00:44:40.043 --> 00:44:40.905
AUDIENCE: Do you find
that part of your job

00:44:40.905 --> 00:44:43.512
is convincing people
that audio is important?

00:44:43.512 --> 00:44:44.470
ANDY FORSBERG: Oh yeah.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.660
RICHARD LUDLOW: That's
a big part of it.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.426
We use the three things--
emotion, function-- no.

00:44:53.426 --> 00:44:55.800
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah, I think
the biggest argument in that

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.960
is probably a mobile scene.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.543
Like in class,
someone was probably

00:45:00.543 --> 00:45:03.043
playing a mobile game during
our talk today and-- (LAUGHING)

00:45:03.043 --> 00:45:04.450
just kidding.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.235
But it's a big thing, is like
well, do they just mute that?

00:45:07.235 --> 00:45:09.110
And then it's like,
yeah, you could say that.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:10.862
But some people do listen to it.

00:45:10.862 --> 00:45:13.070
When they do listen to it,
they listen on headphones.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.550
And we were at a talk at
a conference this year

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:18.240
called GameSoundCon
with a composer

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.970
named Guy Whitmore, who did the
music for Peggle and Peggle 2.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.640
And he was talking
about, there's

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.470
not a more intimate experience
for audio than in headphones

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:27.970
or in that arena.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:33.270
But I think in general, it
is undeniably important.

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.950
RICHARD LUDLOW: You
can put out a game.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:39.010
A mobile game can do
OK with bad audio.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.110
We're not going to lie.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:44.390
That's a thing,
like Flappy Bird.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.280
Believe me, I love Flappy Bird.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.490
I have triple-digits
score on Flappy Bird.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.640
But if you want to
set your game apart,

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.802
people look at that
polished experience.

00:45:57.802 --> 00:45:59.260
If we're talking
about indie games,

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.320
they look at
something like Journey

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.970
or mobile games, something like
Peggel 2, they look at that,

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.290
and they're like, wow,
this entire experience

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:08.030
is super polished.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.405
ANDY FORSBERG:
It's a great game.

00:46:09.405 --> 00:46:11.200
RICHARD LUDLOW: And it's broken
down into the three parts,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:11.890
really.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:15.800
It's the functional, it's
the mechanic of the game,

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.740
it's the visual,
and it's the audio.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.660
And those are all a
third of the game.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:25.220
And if you take out one of
those, you can sell the game.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.989
If you don't have
great art, that's fine.

00:46:26.989 --> 00:46:29.280
There's a lot of great games
that don't have great art.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.700
If you don't have
great mechanics,

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.740
OK, maybe it's pretty
and sounds nice.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:33.640
That'll still sell.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.765
ANDY FORSBERG: If that was
a pie and you had people

00:46:35.765 --> 00:46:38.304
over for a party, would you
hand them only 2/3 of the pie?

00:46:38.304 --> 00:46:38.970
They'd be like--

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:39.886
RICHARD LUDLOW: Crazy.

00:46:39.886 --> 00:46:41.490
ANDY FORSBERG: --this
dude is selfish.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.700
[LAUGHING]

00:46:44.599 --> 00:46:46.890
RICHARD LUDLOW: He says that
because I eat like a pie--

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.556
I have a thing where
I eat a pie a week.

00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:50.634
ANDY FORSBERG: That's
a whole other--

00:46:50.634 --> 00:46:52.050
RICHARD LUDLOW:
But no, seriously,

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.700
so your game can function
without one of these things

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.510
being great.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.930
But it's not going to be
as great of an experience.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:01.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:05.034 --> 00:47:05.700
PROFESSOR 2: No?

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.640
Then I want to thank
you again very much

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.034
for speaking to our students.

00:47:10.034 --> 00:47:11.700
RICHARD LUDLOW: Thank
you for having us.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.990
Yeah, and feel free to put
up our email addresses.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:20.785
Mine is rludlow his is aforsberg
if you want to-- Oh, OK.

00:47:20.785 --> 00:47:22.660
ANDY FORSBERG: --@hexany--
oh, yeah, perfect.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.360
OK, cool.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.380
RICHARD LUDLOW: And yeah, feel
free to shoot us an email.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:31.910
If you have any questions,
we're happy to support audio

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:36.110
with the new generation
of developers.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.430
There's a lot of great
people over at Berkeley, too.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.300
If you're looking for
composers and sound designers

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.820
to collaborate with,
other students,

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.160
there's a lot of great
people over there.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.620
There's the Video
Game Music Club.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.760
ANDY FORSBERG: Don't be
afraid to cross the bridge.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.090
RICHARD LUDLOW: Yes.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.970
The Video Game Music Club,
if you shoot them an email,

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.700
you'll get like 10
responses from people

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.991
who are like, yes, let me
help you work on this game.

00:47:56.991 --> 00:47:57.990
You're not getting paid.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.865
I'm not getting paid.

00:47:58.865 --> 00:48:00.890
They might be OK with that.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:01.760
ANDY FORSBERG: Yeah.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.490
You guys have the
facilities for what you do.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.454
And Berkeley has the
facilities for what they do.

00:48:05.454 --> 00:48:06.953
RICHARD LUDLOW:
Anyway, but then you

00:48:06.953 --> 00:48:08.630
can call us when
you've got paid gigs.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:09.390
[TSKS]

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:10.240
ANDY FORSBERG:
(WHISPERING) Just saying.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.323
RICHARD LUDLOW: All right.

00:48:11.323 --> 00:48:12.570
Anyway, well, thanks so much.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.720
I really appreciate you guys
caring about audio, really,

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.430
honestly.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:18.702
We really appreciate
people caring about music

00:48:18.702 --> 00:48:19.660
and sound a little bit.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:20.760
So thanks so much.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.160
ANDY FORSBERG: And good luck
with the rest of your semester.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.660
RICHARD LUDLOW: Absolutely.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.380
Thanks.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.300
See you guys around.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.340
ANDY FORSBERG: Cheers, guys.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.256
RICHARD LUDLOW: Adios.

00:48:26.256 --> 00:48:28.692
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.050
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.260
So yeah, on that
note, if you are

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:43.660
taking CMS617 next semester, the
advanced game studio, CMS610,

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:49.090
the media arts industries
law class, both of those

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.320
are making a good
polished experience

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.950
for the end of the
semester, with the idea

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.760
of either showing
it to publishers

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.110
or submitting it to a festival.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.240
So audio is really, really
important in those two classes.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.720
And going to Berkeley
for that kind of support

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.014
is highly recommended.

00:49:05.014 --> 00:49:06.680
Also recommend them
this class if you've

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.290
got the time, as well.

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.819
And let us know
if you'd like more

00:49:09.819 --> 00:49:11.860
information about connecting
with Berkeley folks.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.985
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah, we
actually know the instructors

00:49:13.985 --> 00:49:16.200
and even some alums.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.936
But the alums know the people
who are still in college.

00:49:18.936 --> 00:49:20.852
PROFESSOR 1: Yep, just
email Video Game Bosses

00:49:20.852 --> 00:49:22.983
if you'd like that contact info.

00:49:22.983 --> 00:49:25.822
Otherwise, you've got five
minutes to take a break,

00:49:25.822 --> 00:49:27.030
meet back up with your teams.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:31.189
And Pablo will be in at 2
o'clock to play three games.

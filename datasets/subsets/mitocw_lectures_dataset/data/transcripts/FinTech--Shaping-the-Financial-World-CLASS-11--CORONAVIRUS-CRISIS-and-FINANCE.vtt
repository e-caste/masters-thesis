[CLICKING]

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.520
GARY GENSLER: Today we're
going to dive into a topic that

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.400
is relevant to all of us right
now, is the coronavirus crisis.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.550
And for those watching in
the future these recordings,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.030
we'll see how many of these
predictions might come true.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.040
But we're going to
try to sort of frame

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.710
fintech in this crisis.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.750
And it's both a health care
crisis and an economic crisis.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.820
I thought that I would
spend a little bit of time

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.020
in this class talking about some
financial crises in the past.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.366
I'll talk about the 2008
crisis more specifically.

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.150
We'll take a look at some
of the economic forecasts

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.662
here in May of 2020.

00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:59.580
And of course those
looking in the future

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.010
will sort of look back and
say, aha, was it better

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.850
or was it worse?

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.680
I have some points
of view about that,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.140
and I'll share those openly.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.920
And then we'll sort
of finalize about what

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.950
this means for fintech and some
of the sectors and subsectors

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.140
within the space.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.850
So with that, I am going
to try to share some slides

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.920
and get going.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.720
So that's the overview of
what we're going to try to do.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.340
And looking a little bit
at crises, the '08 crisis,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.850
as I said, grounded in
what's happening today.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.180
I'm glad to take questions
at any point in time.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.080
This is a little bit
more relevant today,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.180
but it's also much
broader than just fintech.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.880
Some of the readings
were around what's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.420
happening in financial
technology, the interviews

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.340
that TechCrunch put out
of eight top fintech VCs

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.880
and what they were saying.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.250
I will also close this
discussion with something

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.250
that Boston Consulting Group
just put out in May of 2020.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.620
So just a few
questions to get going

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.910
and see if Romain has a little
fun with calling on folks.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.079
But how's the coronavirus
crisis affecting

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.630
the financial services
world more broadly?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.290
Not fintech, but the financial
services world more broadly.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.670
And though it wasn't in
the readings, many of you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.820
are studying finance and are
from the world of finance.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.460
So these could be just your
personal opinions, of course.

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:58.180
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Good morning, everyone.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.870
Come on, this is one of your
last opportunities to shine.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.170
Olivia, you have the floor.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.990
AUDIENCE: So with
the stock market

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.050
sort of tanking in
the past few months,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.160
that would impact any business
that manages financial assets.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.520
So mutual funds,
hedge funds, the like,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.210
the vast majority
of them probably

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.340
have their asset base
declining in a similar way.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.520
They're all working
remote as well.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.410
So you could think of
ways that might impact

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.490
other financial services
companies that maybe are not

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.410
quite as technologically
savvy as other sectors.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.023
But basically any business--

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:56.940
it could be insurance.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.520
It could be banking--

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.820
will have to revalue
the assets that they

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.670
hold on their balance sheets.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.830
GARY GENSLER: So can I
pause just for a second

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.500
because you mentioned
about four or five

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.330
really important things.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.769
One is the volatility and
that financial services really

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.740
stands, in our economies,
as managing and helping

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.680
the economy more
broadly manage risk.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.510
Taking in risk and transferring
that risk and pricing risk.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.690
But the volatility
itself has come along.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.040
Now, some firms will fail.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.030
Some firms won't.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.880
When I was at Goldman
Sachs, there was a saying--

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.438
I didn't create the saying-- is
that volatility was our friend.

00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:43.730
Well, it was our friend if
we could manage it well, not

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.640
if we stumbled along the way.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.760
But financial firms are
often in the business

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.890
of managing risk, whether
they're insurance companies,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.750
investment banks, and the like.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.830
So that's one thing that
Olivia has mentioned.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.750
But she's also mentioned assets.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.540
And in two different ways,
I just want to highlight.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.290
Assets under management for
the wealth management or asset

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.560
management field
has shrunk a bit.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.020
And so to the extent
that BlackRock

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.360
used to be maybe $7
trillion of assets

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.750
and maybe it's $6 trillion
or $6 going to $5,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.550
that's fewer assets
under management.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.230
But also I think
the second piece

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.070
that Olivia mentioned is
really critical, is valuing

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.840
those assets,
particularly, let's say

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.820
you were in a commercial
banking field,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.180
or you were in a fintech
field making loans.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.970
The actual loan side
of the balance sheet,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.080
you're seeing that commercial
bank after commercial bank

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.310
is taking losses on those
loans in anticipation

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.080
of the delinquencies and
defaults that will come.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.350
So that's a revaluation
of their loan portfolio,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.980
and is likely to continue.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.310
I think I saw Danielle's hand
up as well maybe in there.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.600
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
Yes, and then Adam.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was going
to say one of the other trends

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.148
is a change in the pace of
investment into fintech firms.

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:06.690
That's probably
similar to what we're

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.330
seeing across the
investing portfolio,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.750
but people are struggling
with finding places

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.660
to invest with the
new remote operations,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.630
as well as fintech firms
pivoting and looking more

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.950
internally.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.750
And within the
venture capital space,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.310
there's been some reports of
investors advising startups

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.660
just to focus more on their
core business operations,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.040
scale back auxiliary functions,
and generally have a return

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.450
to core business.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.409
GARY GENSLER: So let's
just take those two.

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.710
And we're going to dive all
the way into all of these,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.240
but one is basically that the
funding, the funding coming

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.800
in to fintech and the venture
capital firms to themselves,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.330
these two married
points, are really

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.580
looking at things differently.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.460
That the companies need to
look at their operations

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.440
and look at core operations.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.350
And we'll talk a lot about
that, whether it's in fintech

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.410
or more broadly in the
economy, that companies

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.410
that were being funded by
the venture capital field

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.190
generally are not yet
cash flow positive.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.200
Some are, when they're at
series C or D or even E rounds.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.140
But certainly early
in their lives,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.110
they generally are
cash flow negative.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.000
And so how much
runway they have,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.120
how much time they
have, in essence,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.260
to turn the corner to get cash
flow positive and profitable.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.080
And of course the venture field
itself is being more cautious,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.270
and so funding is slowing now.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.380
You said Adam was also one of--

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.183
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Yep, Adam.

00:07:44.183 --> 00:07:45.350
AUDIENCE: Hey, good morning.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.340
So my point, not
necessarily related closely

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.820
to fintech, but certainly
an important trend

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.170
in financial services.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.850
So I'm into commodities,
and I'm working on a paper

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.400
with Professor Mirkin
regarding oil prices.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.610
GARY GENSLER: Adam, do you
mind turning on your video

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.970
so we're with you?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.860
AUDIENCE: The thing is I
won't be able to see you then.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.450
That's why--

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.660
GARY GENSLER: Oh, all
right, so let's keep going.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.830
AUDIENCE: So since you can't
just stop producing oil,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.930
like most of the
valves in the US

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.360
and across the globe,
the way it's structured,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.730
it's not a switch
that you can shut off.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.670
And I'm sure all of you know
we don't drive as much now,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.630
and we don't go outside.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.870
Airlines obviously don't operate
with the same capacity they did

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.490
before, so we don't use oil.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.400
But on the other end, we still
produce almost the same amount

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.558
of oil than before.

00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:48.580
Oil prices took a major, major
hit, forcing a lot of valves

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.650
to shut down, probably
for good, just

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.470
because it's not necessarily
possible to reopen

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.760
smaller valves.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.940
And I think the
whole energy sector,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:05.626
if this goes on for a bit
longer, might be completely--

00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:07.590
the way it was
before coronavirus,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.440
it will be completely new after.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.550
Because a lot of
players were forced out.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:21.703
The US's place as the biggest
oil exporter might change.

00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:23.370
GARY GENSLER: So can
we circle that back

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.140
to financial services?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.680
What you're saying is
the commodity field,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.940
the commodity sector
is taking quite a hit.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.410
There's a demand shock.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.040
It's been one of the most
serious demand shocks

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.330
that we've seen in
several decades,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.940
one might even say
in a hundred years,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:51.630
on energy and on many
other physical commodities

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:57.120
in the energy and in the metals
space, less so in agriculture.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.790
And so that demand shock
has led to a price shock.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.840
We've also had a bit of
a scuffle between Russia

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.210
and Saudi Arabia in terms of
oil production and the like.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.220
And so how does that circle
back to the financial services

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.100
field, in your mind, Adam?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.652
Sort of a brief--

00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:19.740
AUDIENCE: I follow, as you know
others look into the fields

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.650
that they are interested
in, follow a lot of funds,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.740
hedge funds, specialized funds
in energy, commodities space.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.552
And a lot of these
players took major hits.

00:10:31.552 --> 00:10:33.260
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so what's your--

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.310
AUDIENCE: And some of the
biggest companies in energy

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.620
is Zimmer Partners, with
like a 25-year track

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.400
preferred of over 20%
average return annually,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.860
so pretty impressive firm.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.180
[INAUDIBLE] reported a 55%
loss in the first quarter.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.110
And they are among the most
renowned funds in the sector.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.990
GARY GENSLER: So
if I can bring it--

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.610
Adam, can I just bring it short?

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.340
Because we don't
have a lot of time.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.580
Let me just shorten it up.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.040
What you're saying is there's
a commodity price shock.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.880
It's moving into a demand
shock, a price shock,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.830
and it's moving into
financial services

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.380
with returns for the
asset managers and hedge

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.495
funds in the commodity space.

00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:20.910
Did I capture it?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.590
GARY GENSLER: Thank you.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.920
So we've talked a little
bit about how it's also

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.370
hitting towards fintech itself.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.230
Some of the funding side, we're
going to go into that more.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.880
But what about the
positive trends?

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.510
Are there any positive trends
likely to emerge out of this

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.205
for financial technology firms?

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.490
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Ivy, would
you like to give it a shot?

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.800
So I think there's
definitely going to be

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.300
winners and losers from here.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.370
So previously, as
we know, there's

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.850
been a huge emergence
in terms of fintech

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.230
across all these spaces.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.270
And a lot of them
are not profitable.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.420
And so I think
the positive trend

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.740
is that firms with, I think,
disciplined underwriting as

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.540
well as actually a
working business model

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.260
will emerge from this
unscathed-- not unscathed,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.080
but probably gaining more
market share and doubling down.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.180
So I actually think
that's a positive,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.060
I think, for just
the general market

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.370
because it is a
little oversaturated.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.070
GARY GENSLER: So
Ivy's highlighted

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.260
it's a highly saturated field.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.980
But for those who have a
truly viable business model,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.290
that may play to
their advantage.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.130
We're also going to talk about
various sectors that might play

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.840
to their advantage as well.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.280
And I think there
is another hand up.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.750
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Hassan?

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so, for instance,

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.310
I can talk about my
country, Bahrain.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:06.830
With this pandemic, I've
noticed that people who are not

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:12.070
used to fintech technologies
have not gotten used to it,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.440
and they're taking advantage
of these kind of services.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.990
So I think that even after
this pandemic is over,

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.070
behavior has changed forever.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.270
So this is my take on it.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.062
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:13:28.062 --> 00:13:29.960
So it accentuates trends.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.570
We've already been over the
last three-ish, four decades

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.350
digitizing the economies, but
not uniformly around the globe.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.790
And so this accentuates
that trend to digitization,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.950
and it accentuates a trend
towards online commerce.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.230
And in both of those trends,
they were happening already.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.610
But I think Hassan's raised
a really important point.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.950
It accelerates some
of those trends.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.490
And those will create
opportunities and challenges,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.580
and there will be winners and
losers, as we talked about.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.030
So I'm going to sort of dive in.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.950
Financial sector
crises are not new.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.420
This is just sort of
a sampling of a list.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.360
And even in 2008, we were
followed by European debt

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.660
crisis in 2009 and 2012.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.600
And so the question will be
is not just this crisis, 2020.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.070
Is it to '21?

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.620
Is it to 2022?

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.900
Does it have
aftershocks beyond that?

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.200
I'm here to say it's not
just the 2020 crisis.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.720
But I think you all
knew that already.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.960
But I'm also going to say that
finance, by its very nature,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.740
tends to have crises
every five, 10, 15 years.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.270
And each time, people will
have some conversation

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.960
about this is the worst
crisis in 50 or 100 years.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.650
So it seems like we get the
once-in-a-50-year crisis every

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.990
5 to 15 years.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:12.240
And in your careers, you will
probably see five or six more.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.140
Now, God willing, they won't
be driven by a pandemic,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.740
and there won't be millions
of people or hundreds

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.090
of millions of people put out
of work through a lockdown

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.510
to protect ourselves
against a virus.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:32.020
But you will see other
financial crises along the way.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.650
I have.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:37.410
I didn't work in the 1970s,
but from the 1980s on.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.810
And some were more severe
than others, of course.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.680
The financial crisis in
'08-- just to remind you.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.750
We're not going to
dive in deeply--

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.260
weak underwriting, a
lot of easy credit,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.490
poor risk management, and
then multiple failures around.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.300
This is what was
called systemic risk.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.390
Emanating first out of the
US and the housing markets,

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.460
and the housing markets
had an asset bubble.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.260
But it was also true in Spain.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.450
It was also true in
other European countries.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.880
It was not only
isolated to the US.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.670
But in a financial sense--
not in a health care sense,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.500
but in a financial sense--

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.500
we Americans and a couple
other markets like Spain

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.320
and elsewhere sort
of propagated out

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.200
to other markets a contagion, if
you wish, a financial contagion

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.800
to the rest of the world.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.990
Now, some countries like China,
Australia, Canada sort of

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.330
weathered the
financial storm well,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.570
but they were still hit
with an economic shock.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.970
You couldn't avoid
it, in a sense,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.230
because we're so interconnected
economically around the globe.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.860
And what was the result after
that crisis, just for a moment?

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.720
There was financial reform.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.950
Around the globe, primarily
in Europe, Canada, Australia,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.760
the US, Japan had
to put in place

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.180
a stronger set of regulations.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.829
It didn't change the fundamental
basic regulatory environment,

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:15.490
but more capital, more shock
absorbers within the banking

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.880
sector, more transparency
in the derivatives

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.117
markets, and the like.

00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:23.160
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Gary,
I think I recognize you

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.608
on this picture, no?

00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:26.026
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so where?

00:17:26.026 --> 00:17:28.098
Where, Romain?]

00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:30.450
TEACHING ASSISTANT:
In the front row?

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:35.070
GARY GENSLER: Oh, you mean
the center, bald head?

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.860
No, it's just a
little light hearted.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.990
We could have done a poll
and asked how many people

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.920
think that's me?

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.720
But I'm sorry to let you down.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.310
That's Ben Bernanke,
the chairman

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.830
of the Federal Reserve.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.400
I think I am in the
bottom right-hand corner.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.992
So I think I'm sort of not in
the front row with the chairman

00:17:53.992 --> 00:17:54.950
of the Federal Reserve.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.180
I think I was in about the third
row, as my memory serves me.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.605
But thank you.

00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:02.480
For those who don't--

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.540
I was honored to be chair of
the Commodity Futures Trading

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.790
Commission at the time.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.680
That set of reforms--

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.970
that set of reforms, I give
you here a four-year-old chart

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.930
out of a law firm,
Davis Polk, that

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.050
kept track of these things.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.490
But those Dodd-Frank reforms
were around transparency

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.830
in the derivatives markets,
asset-backed securitizations,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.740
the sort of resiliency
of banking itself,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.740
and a lot about consumer
protection, mortgage market

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.280
reforms, and the like,
and systemic risk.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.740
And so this just
gives you a sense

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.930
of all the different
slip streams

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.210
that came out of that reform.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:52.330
Many people would say
that that crisis started

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.740
in the financial sector.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.960
It's not quite true.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.280
It was the housing
sector and asset

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.520
bubble in the housing
sector, easy credit,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.360
and certainly the financial
sector was at the center of it.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.560
But it's the mix of housing,
finance, and frankly

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.850
a failure in Washington
and in London

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.600
and elsewhere to stay abreast
and help regulate the market.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.660
So a failure in
the capital markets

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.440
and in finance, but also
a failure in public policy

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.650
that got behind and loosened
relation to finance.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.720
We're living in a different
set of crises now, I would say.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.460
Fintech, fertile ground.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.530
We've talked about this for
the whole 10 classes we've had.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.800
But in the midst of
the corona crisis,

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.090
I think four of the fertile
grounds that we've already

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.760
talked about are accentuated.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.230
Digitization of money.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.810
We still have paper money.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.860
I think we're going to
move even faster on this.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.460
What's an interesting thing
in the last seven weeks,

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.320
the US Federal
Reserve has actually

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.780
continued to issue paper money.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.170
Paper money has grown
not significantly,

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.290
but it's grown close to
4% or 5% in outstanding.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.020
Now, that might be
a flight to quality.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.630
It might even be drug
runners who want paper money.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.050
Wide acceptance of new tech.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.620
I think that we already
were realistically

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:37.070
in a mobile phone, mobile
delivery user interface.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.320
But I think that's accentuated.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.360
I think we've
accentuated these trends

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.970
about large pools of
data and the value

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.150
of those pools of data.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.340
So what do we see in terms
of fintech incumbents

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.600
and the big tech?

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.850
Well, big finance
we've talked about.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.730
Huge volumes in the capital
markets, government debt

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.840
markets.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.800
They're working on these
stimulus loan programs.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.980
And they've also boosted
their allocations

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.430
of loan loss reserves.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:10.020
I think we're still
six to 18 months away

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.790
from significant delinquencies.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.920
In the corporate sector and
the leveraged loan marketplace,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.590
we'll see some of those earlier.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.730
The high-yield debt market,
small business loan market,

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.680
we'll see those in 2020.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.970
I think in the household
sector, we'll peak in 2021.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.170
I could be wrong.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.420
And when people are listening
to this in the future,

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.440
they're going to look back and
say, boy, he took some risks.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.190
But I'm willing to
take some risks where I

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.570
think there's some challenges.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.100
I think also big finance is
very reliant on connectivity.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.730
These trading floors-- if
you went into a trading floor

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.610
in London or New York,
you would see hundreds

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.770
of people on a trading floor.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.870
And now they're dispersed.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.950
And the New York Stock Exchange
went to electronic trading.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.480
Will they ever even come back
with physical market makers

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.450
on a floor of a New
York Stock Exchange?

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.770
Maybe not.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.950
I'll be willing to
make that prediction.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:13.500
But big reliance
on connectivity.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.340
Big tech, significant
online growth.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.130
And you have different
parts of big tech.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.510
You have the ones
that are really

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:25.300
focused on data and analytics,
like Google and Baidu.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.570
They're being called
more into the fray

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.670
to use that data to help protect
the public through something

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.200
called contact
tracing and the like.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.360
You have the online market
shops like Alibaba and Amazon,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.380
huge growth, of course.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.540
So significant online growth.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.740
And then we go to
the fintech startups.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.840
And I'd say the real
focus on the fintech

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.130
startups is this number one
point, what's your runway?

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.240
A term that we haven't
talked about in this class,

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.530
but runway is what's
your burn rate?

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.570
See, early startups-- not
just in financial technology--

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.790
early startups usually
are spending more

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.230
than their revenues.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.500
And they're trying to
work to that sweet spot

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.420
when they can get to a place
and be really successful, where,

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.450
of course, revenues
are more than costs,

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.730
but also they've
built a platform.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.590
They've built and start to
commercialize the network

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.820
economics.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.170
And by network economics
or platform economics,

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.170
it's bringing two
sides of a marketplace

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.320
together and building a
platform in between it.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.950
But there's a big focus on
revenue models and adoption.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.290
And if you've
recently raised money,

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.240
you're in better shape
then if you haven't.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.950
So it's not about whether you're
at the seed round or a series C

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:55.930
or D, meaning you've done three
or four rounds of funding.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.490
It's really, how much
cash do you have?

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.490
What's your burn rate?

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.400
And hunkering down.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.840
IPOs, Initial Public
Offerings, probably

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.040
off the table for the rest of
2020, and maybe well into '21.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.940
Venture capitalists will talk,
as you saw in these readings,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.070
that they are
investing, but they're

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.140
going to be slow and cautious.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:23.390
And valuations, just like
the public market's down.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.170
But if you don't
have an IPO takeout,

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.910
if you can't exit in
the public markets,

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.730
if you can't readily
convince your venture

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.430
capitalists about
your revenue models,

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.060
your valuations are coming off.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.390
I think consolidation increases.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.230
I think that the sectors
matter, and there's going

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.920
to be winners versus losers.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:51.100
I think anybody that's deeply
reliant on transaction fees,

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.230
particularly in the
payment space, that's

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.430
a challenge right now.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.540
Some businesses, the
sector matters even more,

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.530
like if you were Toast
servicing the restaurant field,

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.480
I have not talked to them
since this crisis started,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.110
but I think that's
a challenging thing.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.030
You could be a
transaction-based business

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.060
and have been in
great shape in January

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.550
and really pretty
lousy shape right now.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.210
So some areas like retail,
travel, events, obviously.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.730
Mobile trading-- mobile trading,
on the other hand, might be up,

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.550
the Robinhood numbers
and others like them.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.260
Wealth management
like Betterment

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.910
that we talked about, maybe.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.030
But if you're like
Root Insurance,

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:39.560
if you're an auto insurance
tech and people aren't driving,

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.940
it might be the other way.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.830
So sector matters a lot.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.740
Compliance up.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.120
International cross-border
remittances, I believe likely

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.470
has some possibility.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:57.570
But I still think runway matters
and consolidation increases.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.250
And so a couple other thoughts.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.590
Additional opportunities.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.480
I think there's
additional opportunities

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.870
if you're serving those tapping
into the fiscal stimulus

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.470
and loan programs.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.080
So what you've seen
around the globe,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.730
whether it was PayPal,
SoFi, others saying,

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.950
we will help a small business.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.550
Revolut in Europe, we will
help a small business fill out

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.640
their forms, apply
for the programs

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.360
here in the US,
programs in Europe.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.250
And that's an opportunity
to actually build

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.230
customer relations.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.750
Numerous amongst the fintech
startups here in the US

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.960
have raised their hand and
said to the Small Business

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.840
Administration, can
we be basically part

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.330
of the PPP program?

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.490
I don't mean receive
a forgivable loan.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.610
I mean help issue
forgivable loans.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.910
Romain I want to pause because
I see there is activity

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.520
in the chat room and
just see if there's--

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.110
TEACHING ASSISTANT: So we have
a general question from Rosanna

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.810
on whether there is a chance
that this crisis will impact

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.280
the stability of the US dollar.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.020
GARY GENSLER: I
think, great question.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.700
When you say stability,
I think of volatility.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.900
But Rosanna, do you mean that,
or do you mean its centrality

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.120
in the world trading system?

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.090
AUDIENCE: I think centrality
in the world trade system.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:18.800
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.480
So I think that crises
like this usually--

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.090
and history shows
this time and again--

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.720
it's flight to quality.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:33.160
And so right now, the US
dollar is that quality asset.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.280
Our economy has got
huge challenges.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.220
But I'm saying as
a fiat currency

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.440
compared to other
fiat currencies,

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.940
I think you've still
seen the flight

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.670
to quality in the US dollar.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:54.610
I do think that if you go out
multiple decades, our handling,

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.430
as a public policy matter,
people will be looking,

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.080
how did our government respond?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.200
How did we respond to
the health care crisis?

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.550
And I don't mean in the middle--

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.550
right now, there's going
to be all those debates

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.980
and they'll influence all sorts
of things like the November

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.480
election.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.830
I'm talking about longer term.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.530
Longer term, how
did we as a society,

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:18.530
how did we as a government
handle this crisis?

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.530
And I think this story
is not written yet,

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:24.370
even though right now
there's a lot of reasons

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.920
to think we didn't handle things
well in January and February

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.510
and March.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.270
But we don't know about
the reopening yet.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:36.370
But the US dollar, which
is probably over half--

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:37.930
depending upon
what statistic you

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.590
want to pick, between
half and 2/3 of trade,

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.700
the foreign currency markets,
the central bank reserves

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.940
around the globe are
on the US dollar.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.400
I think you raise
a great question.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.970
Will it change the US
dollar as the world's sort

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.150
of leading currency?

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.370
My guess is, probably not.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.920
I think we're still
multiple decades away.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.470
I think if China wants
to take that role

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.980
at some point in time, probably
late in the 21st century

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.910
sometime, they have to
really adjust themselves

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.920
to having a more
open capital market.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.550
The US took the role
from the British

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:25.010
just about the same time
as the last big pandemic,

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.800
the one a hundred years
ago, the Spanish flu.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.230
It's a coincidence, maybe,
so you're right to raise it.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.060
But I don't think China
is in the position.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.310
They don't have free and
open capital markets.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.280
The US had free and
open capital markets.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.190
They don't, frankly, have the
same legal systems that we had.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:48.400
And so the UK was in relative
decline to the US already.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.330
I don't think it was the Spanish
flu that gave us the chance

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.180
to take over.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.010
World War I did give us
a chance to take over.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.470
And so you're right, some future
crisis might be that moment,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.430
but I don't think
this is that moment.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.710
That's a good question.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.110
What about the
volatility, though?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.300
Do you think also that's--

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.480
GARY GENSLER: I've got
three minutes to finish up,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.100
so can we do this offline?

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.060
But there's also
additional challenges

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.620
on delinquencies and defaults.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.360
I think for fintech
companies, they

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.330
have to be very
aware, especially

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.500
if you're in consumer or
small business lending,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.130
that delinquencies and
defaults will go up.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.470
I just think-- and if
you have a business

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.020
model related to float because
interest rates went down.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.050
So this is where
I'm going to close

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.170
is this chart from the Boston
Consulting Group breaks

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.750
subsectors.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.890
And again, in this
class, I constantly

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.960
am focused on granularity.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.540
You can be strategic, but
you have to be tactical.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.690
You've got to get
down to each sector.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:01.220
In payments, trade finance
is probably at high risk.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.160
But other areas might be OK.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.830
Account to account,
person to a person

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.270
like Venmo, Paypal's Venmo,
might be in a good place.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:15.330
In lending, unsecured
personal lending,

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.700
Boston Consulting
Group says a problem.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.550
But their other parts, like
lending on infrastructure,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.810
might be OK.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.430
So you've got to get granular.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:27.240
You've got to think about
each sector individually.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.330
Insurance, I also
think it will be

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.030
interesting to see what happens
to some of the auto insurers

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.230
that BCG hasn't
put on this chart.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.230
Everybody's going to have
their different chart.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.080
This is not to say this
is the accurate chart.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.120
I raised this Boston
Consulting Group

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.160
chart because I want to always
remind, it's granularity.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.810
You need both
strategy and tactics

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:55.280
and to get into where the
cracks are in the system.

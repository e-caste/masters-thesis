WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
PROFESSOR: Build
things, what we'll do

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.890
is this stuff will
go on the web.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.683
Usually, we put it
up the night before.

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:08.100
We had some problems
with Stellar,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.683
but normally, you can actually
see the lecture notes the night

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:13.210
before on the web as a PDF.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.440
And there will always be a
paper copy for you here as well.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.760
Let me go through a
few practical things.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.340
So you know who we are.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.682
We have no TA this year.

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:29.640
Normally, we have a TA.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.307
Because it's an off
year, we're actually

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:34.200
going to run this with
students out of our own group.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.560
Because there are five lab
sessions, and there you

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.860
will have students from
our own group helping you.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.190
We will meet here for
the lectures, 1390,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.620
but the labs will be in 1115.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590
There'll be five of them, and
we'll announce them well ahead

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.390
of time.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
There is a course website
which is on Stellar.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.395
There's not much on
there, like I said,

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:58.937
because we had some
problems with it.

00:00:58.937 --> 00:01:00.600
But for later in the
day and tomorrow,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.360
you'll see course materials
being uploaded on there.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.489
This is where extra
readings, for example,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.890
will be uploaded or
links to readings,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.360
in case we can't
post them ourselves.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.850
Grades are determined
by five problem sets.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.160
So there are five lab sessions.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.730
The way they work is that
instead of coming to class,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.230
we meet in the lab.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.140
And we give you an assignment,
modeling assignment,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.790
and you start it there.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.250
And then you will never
be able to finish it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.370
in that 90 minutes, but
then you take it home.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.040
And typically, you have two to
three weeks for it to be due.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700
So think of it as an
extended homework problem.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.410
We start you in
the lab, because we

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.378
feel it's important we solve
the practical problems.

00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:46.170
You have to get a cold
running or something

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.140
to do the modeling.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.780
So once that's done, you can
just take it home and finish it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.320
there.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
And we will give
you computer access,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.050
so you don't need
your own computing

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.790
resources of where to run that.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.700
So we'll work that all
out in the first lab.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.310
And so because of that, there's
no final exam in this course.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.160
I wouldn't really
know what to ask.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.910
There's one thing.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.039
We really like
students, if you're

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.710
a graduate student, to
register for credit,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.320
so not just listener status.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.150
This is a course that's not
required in any program.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
So the only way these
courses stay alive

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.160
is if people actually
register for them.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.400
It's a sad thing, but the
university administration only

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.230
counts registered
students in a class.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.130
So if we don't do this, we
have 20 people sitting here,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.570
but on paper, my dean tells me I
only had three people in class,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.810
and that's how it's
counted in the department.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.580
So we really want
people to register.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.580
Also, that forces you
to do the problems,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.520
and I feel in a modeling course,
there really isn't much use

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.350
if you don't do the problems.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.330
Postdocs, of course,
can't really register,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.690
so those are free to
just come and listen.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.720
But I hope if your
postdoc or anything else,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.290
visitor, that you also come
to the labs to do those.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.740
I think we have about 20 seats,
so we'll be fine with that.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.240
OK.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.220
We don't have a very
specific course text,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.830
but like I said, in some case,
we'll give you review articles.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.660
We'll give you handouts.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.790
There's a few good books
though that you may want

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.160
to browse through on occasion.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.100
So depending on what's
your main interest,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.590
the book by Allen and
Tildesley is an old classic

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.810
on computer
simulation of liquids.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.690
In the end, it's really a
book on molecular dynamics.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.530
It's quite old by now,
but it's a very good basis

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.000
to start from.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.930
It doesn't have the
most advanced algorithms

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.120
or new techniques in it
per se, but it's really

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.020
still a very good book.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.700
Rob Phillips wrote a newer
book on, essentially,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.100
modeling which both
contains continuum

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.750
and atomistic modeling.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.110
That has a heavy slant
on mechanical behavior.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.910
So if you're more
interested in that,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.720
that may be a book that
you want to look into.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.360
Jensen is one of my favorites,
although it's heavily

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.709
chemistry focused, modeling
of molecules and so,

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.160
but it's actually
very clearly written.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.790
And Thijssen is a
great book if you

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.890
want to focus on ab
initio methods and quantum

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.130
mechanics, which we'll
do later in the course.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.260
And Frenkel and
Smit is my favorite

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.110
for statistical
mechanics, if you

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.660
want to learn about the
statistical mechanics

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.520
of molecular dynamics
and Monte Carlo

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.580
methods and things like that.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.810
This is really a very, very
good book, very thoroughly done.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.310
OK.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.600
So I should say a few words
about the course objectives.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.080
When we designed this
course, we deliberately

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.420
made it a somewhat introductory
and overview subject.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.480
We wanted this to be a course
that was not for experts.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.410
So if you already know
everything about ab initio

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.020
methods and molecular
dynamics and Monte Carlo,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.270
you may actually start
getting bored after a while.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.960
We really wanted this to be a
course that an average graduate

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.630
student, somebody who was
doing experimental research

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.420
for example, also could take.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.310
So what we mainly
try to do is teach

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.660
the tools of modern
computation materials science

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.600
and how they can be applied
to diverse materials problems.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.940
So we will give you technical
details of the tools

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.510
but only to the extent that
you need them to understand

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.340
how you can apply them.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.967
OK?

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:46.800
So we will, of course,
tell you, for example

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.770
what molecular dynamics is,
what the basis is of it,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.600
what some of the
basic algorithms are.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.590
But we will not go into the
very detailed, novel algorithms

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.070
to make it a factor of too
fast or something like that.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.010
So we will not do a lot of
detailed algorithmic work

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.160
in the course.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.820
So there is a heavy focusing on
understanding the physics that

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.420
goes in and because of that the
physics and the applications

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.600
that can come out.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.150
So because of that,
you will occasionally

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.200
see us teach materials theory
rather than computation.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.470
Because in some cases, I feel
the hard part of computation

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.810
is knowing what to
compute, and for that,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.670
you need some basic
materials here.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.180
Like when I do a case study
on diffusion, towards the end,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.630
I may have to tell you a little
bit about diffusion theory,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.350
activation barriers and
correlation factors,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.870
because then we can actually
connect that to the things

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.340
we can calculate.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.330
So you should think of this
as a course in modeling

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.080
towards material science
and materials application.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.230
We do very little purely
numerical work, actually almost

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.290
none to speak of.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.150
OK.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.120
So the way I see atomistic
modeling is really

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.500
as the integration of
these four basic fields--

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.740
physics, mathematics, computer
science, and material science,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.540
and that's how we'll
tend to approach it.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.430
Let me go through the
calendar, because it gives you

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.350
a broad outline of the course.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.990
This calendar is always
subject to change.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.620
Even though we teach
this with two people,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.900
we never seem to able to get our
travel schedules coordinated.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.850
In some cases, we
also slip a little,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.970
but the gross outline
will remain the same.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.590
Essentially, there's
the first section,

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.760
which I would say is energy
descriptions which is

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.820
essentially from here to here.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.870
This is energy methods.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.120
And it starts with
more empirical methods,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.090
potentials things like
embedded atom method,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.720
and then it goes into ab initio.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.620
So this is largely DFT, although
we do some quantum chemistry.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.680
We give it some quantum
chemistry basis as well.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.610
After that, it's really
finite temperature techniques.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:25.160
So we do Molecular
Dynamics, MD, and that

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.100
runs into coarse-graining
theory and Monte Carlo.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.473
So this is really
finite temperature.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.850
OK, and after that,
it really is a--

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.990
I'll be honest-- a
set of random topics.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.650
We do case studies.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.570
Last year, I did
one on hyperdynamics

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.490
which is accelerated
molecular dynamics.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.200
We did one on diffusion.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.700
This year, we have
great ambitions

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.500
to do one on
Green-Kubo relations

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.280
and how you can extract
transport properties.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.320
We have a great lecture
from Chris Wolverton,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.720
which we've done every year,
which students really like.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.330
Chris is the Head of Scientific
Computing in Ford Motor Company

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.080
and gives a lecture on how
they use even first principles

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.510
calculation and modeling
in general, in Ford

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.390
and has a brilliant case that.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.290
It's really fascinating
lecture, how they

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.090
saved the company millions.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.340
It's a great story how they
saved the company millions

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.690
by doing quantum mechanics.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.840
So stay tuned for that.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.180
So that's roughly how we work.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.962
As you can see, there
are labs interspersed--

00:09:33.962 --> 00:09:35.420
three, four, where
is number three?

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.710
Here we go.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.580
Essentially, one on generic
modeling which is really

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.190
getting you introduced
to building cells,

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.580
and we do this with
potential models.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.720
Two on density
functional theory,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.460
one on the molecular
dynamics, and one

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.130
on Monte Carlo and
coarse-graining methods.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.640
So that's roughly how
the course will work.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.520
So there are any questions
on the schedule or topic

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.800
coverage in the course?

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:07.510
Yes?

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.052
AUDIENCE: How long are the labs,
and when do they take place?

00:10:10.052 --> 00:10:12.580
PROFESSOR: Well the
labs, so they start--

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.740
they are essentially
during lecture time,

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.800
but then you will have
to continue it on own.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.600
So we get you started
on the problem,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.770
introduce you, show you where
the codes are, how to run them.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.560
And typically, in
the earlier labs

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.080
that are not computationally
intensive, like the first one,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.880
you can really run
things and the answer

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.150
comes back in no time.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.500
So we actually get some
results already in class

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.120
and discuss them.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.540
On some of the computationally
more intensive ones,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.800
like DFT, there'll would be
less of that and more time

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.180
that you need to spend
afterwards with them.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:47.920
OK?

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.780
They tend to have
about a due date that's

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.740
two to three weeks
after the actual lab.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.260
OK?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.820
Any other questions?

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.320
OK.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.780
So I wanted to talk a
little about the growing

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.830
importance of modeling.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.760
I started computational
modeling in 1988,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.960
when it was a rarity, especially
in material science department.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.680
Now, you see it everywhere.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.460
It's one of these
enormously growing fields.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.610
You'd be surprised, but even
atomistic level modeling is

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.980
probably now more
intensively done in industry

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.800
than it is in academia.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.990
We think of it as a
broader academic subject,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.460
but it really has taken a
foothold in corporations.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.680
I wanted to show you
a few examples of how

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.460
I think that really showed
the impact of modeling,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.070
where modeling is used to
make important decisions.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.000
This is a picture
from the ASCI Program.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.590
When the US was planning to sign
the Nuclear Stockpile Treaty,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.060
which meant that--

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.260
the nuclear stockpile treaty is
basically that you cannot test

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.050
nuclear missiles anymore
by setting them off.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.020
Because essentially that's
so the US was concerned

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.490
how could we verify
the reliability

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.490
of nuclear missiles,
because they're essentially

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.090
going to sit for 100
years in their silo.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.950
And there was an enormous
program in the US

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.830
for, literally, they would just
blow one up once in a while

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.220
to see if it still
works, and now, they

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.380
can't do that anymore.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.240
Although, the US has
actually not ratified

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.370
the Nuclear Stockpile
Treaty, they still

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.860
are sticking with it.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.830
And some, I don't
know, smart people

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.230
decided what are we going to
do with all this money which

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.730
was several hundred
million dollars.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.290
So they decided,
well, we're going

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.190
to model the reliability
of nuclear missiles,

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.620
and that led to what's called
ASCI Program, the Advanced

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.470
Simulation Computing
Initiative, which is literally

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.220
one of the largest computational
modeling programs in the world

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.030
now.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.790
It's definitely
not all atomistics,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.150
but there definitely is a large
atomistic component on it.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.060
And the whole idea was,
as they call it cynically,

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.940
it's modeling from
button to boom.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.490
So they model everything--
aging of plutonium,

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:12.110
aging of corrosion of
the alloys, corrosion

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.850
of the electronics.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.840
Whether actually the time
is actually ripe for that

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.710
is another question.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.870
Whether you can reliably
model all these things

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.740
is another question.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.730
But just another
example that computing

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.520
has taken on a quite
important role.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.400
Here's my favorite.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
This is-- or was, I
don't know if was--

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.970
this was the largest computer
for a while, the Earth

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.280
Simulator, in Japan.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.410
When it came out, it was
the largest computer.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.930
I think it eclipsed the
fastest computer in the US

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.630
by a factor of five,
when it came out,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:55.580
and it's solely used to model
environmental processes.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.510
The whole idea was that the
Japanese had the ambitious idea

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.030
that they really wanted to use
this for predicting climate

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.200
change in the end.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.530
There's other work done,
but that's its main purpose.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.997
I think now Blue Light
that's being built,

00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:10.580
but that is actually
not quite active,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.830
in Livermore, will
be bigger than this.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.670
But again, you see enormous
computational resources spent.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.960
This is I think like several
hundred million dollar setup,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.990
enormous computational
resources being set up

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.470
to deal with what's in the end
the very important problem,

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.790
environmental change.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.290
OK.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.230
People usually don't believe
me, but I once in my head

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.760
made up a list of
companies where

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.680
I knew they were
doing first principles

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.090
modeling in companies, and
this is not a complete study.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.070
This is just the ones that
I visited, that I know of.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.820
There's actually not
a complete study out,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.350
and I'll put the link on
the web, this study that

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.350
was sponsored by the
National Science Foundation

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.730
and the University of Loyola.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.770
Where literally a
panel for two years

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.890
visited companies all around
the world and looked at what

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.540
they did with modeling.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.980
And so there's an enormously
comprehensive list

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.980
there of the kind
of work that's being

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.980
done in companies with
computational modeling

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.020
on materials.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.280
But again, so you see a lot of
big companies in here actually.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.440
The largest groups
that I know of

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:27.620
are probably at Motorola,
Siemens, Ford, Nippon Steel,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.970
and I think these days
at Toyota as well.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.280
These all have very substantial
groups in atomistic modeling

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.840
on materials.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.790
OK.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.610
So this course is supposed
to be interactive.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.720
We used to have this
course in a small room.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.740
This is a bit of an
unusually big setting for us.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.010
So normally, like there's not
enough seats for people which

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.310
makes us feel much better.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.360
So this is supposed to
be somewhat interactive.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.700
So like MBA classes do,
they ask you questions,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.180
and you're supposed to answer.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.530
Why are you here in the end?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.570
Why do you think
modeling is useful?

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.010
I know there's
some familiar faces

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.593
here, people who did
for the research,

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.640
but what do you think--

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.810
what's so useful about it?

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.185
Why do you think
companies do it?

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:16.220
Because anything companies do
is because it makes them money,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.170
or it saves them money.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.760
So what's so great about it?

00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.750
Too early in the
morning for that.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.900
Huh?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.780
What can you do
better or faster,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.120
or what is it that
you cannot, maybe,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.600
unless you do it with modeling?

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.650
Yes, sir.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.610
AUDIENCE: You can
set exact variables.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.125
Like in your
experiment, you might

00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.560
think, if you're trying
to set variables,

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.140
that they're changing
a little bit.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.682
PROFESSOR: You hit
the nail right on.

00:16:43.682 --> 00:16:45.110
That's actually number one.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.780
It's not the one you
usually bring up, control.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.860
The number one reason people
use modeling is control.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.080
In essence, think of
it as doing experiments

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.070
in a controlled environment.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:56.960
OK?

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.250
So because you have
anomalous control,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.329
you can very quickly understand
what goes on in your systems,

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.760
assuming that the answer
that comes out is right.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.250
That is the number one reason,
to solve, to isolate phenomena

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.585
by controlling the variables.

00:17:14.585 --> 00:17:15.710
But what else do you think?

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.630
There's usually one that people
always bring up right away.

00:17:25.398 --> 00:17:27.412
AUDIENCE: To do the experiment.

00:17:27.412 --> 00:17:29.370
PROFESSOR: You don't have
to do the experiment.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.920
So to predict things
without having

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.690
to do the work of
the experiment,

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.905
and that's definitely
becoming more and more

00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:36.120
an important role.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.860
OK?

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.380
It's still done
less than you think.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.960
Most modeling is still
done on materials

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.058
that have already been made
and that people have already

00:17:45.058 --> 00:17:47.600
done the experiment on and that
they're trying to understand.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.250
But more and more
what you bring up

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.540
which is trying to predict
truly before you actually

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.070
do the experiment, the virtual
searching for materials

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.650
is playing a more and
more important role.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.960
Let me show you a few
examples that point this out.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.060
There's another one
that we didn't bring up,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.160
and it's using modeling where
you cannot do the experiment

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.980
or where it's really very
hard or very expensive to do

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.090
the experiment.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.760
And here's one, this
is from Alfie's group,

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.140
which is, I think,
Cambridge or--

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:24.848
AUDIENCE: London.

00:18:24.848 --> 00:18:26.322
PROFESSOR: London, close by.

00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:27.560
OK.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.610
Where knowing what
the composition is

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.900
of the mantle in the Earth, both
the composition and the phases

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.870
that are present, is an
enormously difficult problem.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.180
But it's one of these
actually quite literally

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.350
hot problems in
materials geology.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.110
We know that there's iron
and magnesium and oxygen

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.390
and silicon and a few other
things, but in the end,

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.270
we really don't know
what phases they

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.550
form, what their
elastic properties are,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.540
and things like that.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.730
And the experiments
are really hard.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.910
Somewhere in the
mantle, pressures

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:08.960
are I think anywhere from
50 to maybe 300 gigapascals.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.208
These are really hard
experiments to do.

00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:13.250
And I was yesterday at
the University of Illinois

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.940
in the Department of
Geology, and they showed me

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.440
the way they do high pressure
experiments with diamond anvil

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.940
cells.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.650
You need about a 1/4 to 1/2 a
carat diamond, first of all,

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.740
so these people have a safe in
their lab, it's pretty cool,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.140
where they're diamonds sit.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.920
And then you have to make
really small samples,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.390
pushed very hard on them
with a diamond anvil.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.130
OK?

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.600
So you're really pushing on it.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.093
This sits in an
enormous container,

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.510
because you have
to keep a hundred

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.490
gigapascal on this
thing, and then you

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.260
have to characterize it.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.310
Can you imagine?

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.500
So you have this
enormous holder,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.990
because you're putting
it under 100 GPa,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.542
and you've got to see inside.

00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:52.250
So they're really hard
experiments to do.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.630
You can't really control
the temperature very well.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.300
So this is where
modeling is great,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.920
if you believe the answers.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.160
So a lot of people do
computational quantum mechanics

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.220
on phases under high pressure.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.860
High pressure is
trivial in computation.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.380
Just push on it, you change
the lattice parameter,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.340
and you constrain it.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.430
You control the variable,
and you have high pressure.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.090
300 gigapascal, no problem.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:16.590
OK.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.450
This one I particularly like.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.613
There was an article
in the New York Times.

00:20:26.613 --> 00:20:29.030
This is when science made the
New York Times which doesn't

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.460
happen too often, in 1999.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.720
The people had basically
been able to visualize

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:41.210
electron densities, orbitals,
and that's the left picture.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.950
This is I think in copper oxide.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.230
I forgot what this is.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.540
In some copper oxide,
where they literally

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.190
were able to visualize
the orbitals,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.270
and they look like d
orbitals, don't they?

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.390
This is actually one
of these things that

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.030
is quite an experimental feat.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.010
It made the New York
Times, because people

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.410
could do it experimentally.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.167
This is trivial computationally.

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:08.000
When you do computational
quantum mechanics,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.300
you will get orbitals
and orbital populations.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.390
That doesn't mean that
the experiment is useless.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.230
OK?

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.080
Because the experiment could
be the critical verification

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.720
of what you do in your theory,
but I'm just showing you

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.030
that these things have an
enormously different level

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.740
of complexity.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.010
And if you're ever going
to use both computations

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.730
and experiment, the one key
thing that will put you ahead

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.450
is understanding what is
most efficient for a given

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.570
problem, either
computation or experiment.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:45.150
Because the complexity of either
has no relation to each other.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.810
So for some
problems, computation

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.050
is extremely efficient, and
experiment is really hard,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.150
and for some problems,
it's the other way around.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.340
And understanding
where to use what,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.930
if you're going to
use both, I think

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.900
is the thing that would
really get you ahead.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.400
And unfortunately,
most of the time,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.400
that doesn't happen,
because usually people only

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.362
do one of the two.

00:22:06.362 --> 00:22:07.820
Here, for example,
this is actually

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.060
from Professor Marzari,
the electron density

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.920
in lead titanate which is a
perovskite, a ferroelectric.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.250
So you see beautiful orbitals
without the graininess

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.990
of experiments.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.070
The other thing
is, sometimes, you

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.920
can do things fast
computationally.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.870
This is out of my own work.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.030
One of the areas we work in is
predicting crystal structure.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.480
Typically, getting a phase
diagram of a material

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.890
used to take about a PhD thesis.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.660
It takes you that long
to make all the samples,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.100
do the structural analysis,
get the phase boundaries.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:57.490
In about a six month time frame,
we ran 15,000-- it says 10,000.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.140
We were up at 15,000--

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.960
first principles calculations
to find the structures,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.530
the ground-state structures
in 80 metallic systems, 80

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.400
binary metallic systems.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.640
So in some sense, we did 80 PhD
thesises in about six months.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.030
So there are certain
things that you can now

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.550
solve more efficiently
computationally

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.710
than experimentally.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.460
And I think it makes
sense, like let's say

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.800
you are looking for
structure of material,

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.590
to first do the
computation, and then

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.070
when you need to resolve
issues, then do the experiment,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:35.050
rather than first blindly
do the experiment.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:39.020
And we'll talk a little more
later about these things.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.170
Control, we already
talked about control.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.430
That's the number one.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.320
Here's one of the first examples
of where I saw that applied.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.680
In the early '80s,
aluminum lithium

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.020
was one of the key
alloys that people

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.790
thought of for airframes.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:24:00.202
Because of course now,
airframes are aluminum copper.

00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:01.660
If you want to make
it lighter, you

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.952
have to go to lighter elements.

00:24:02.952 --> 00:24:05.560
Well, lithium is the
lightest solid element.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.740
So substituting the copper
away and using aluminum lithium

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.480
alloys was supposed to
make really light alloys.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.900
It didn't pan out, because
they're not very weldable.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.290
So you actually find very little
aluminum lithium on airplanes

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.910
these days.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.860
But the key issue in
aluminum lithium is that--

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.580
this is the stable
phase diagram.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.020
So there's an FCC solid solution
in equilibrium with a compound,

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.090
but what actually
strengthens the material is

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.030
a metastable precipitate
which is in here.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.260
And because it's metastable,
it's very hard to study,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.720
because to study it,
you need to make it big.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.600
To strengthen the alloys,
you have to keep it small.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.640
But to study it,
like with microscopy,

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.080
you need to make it big enough.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.970
But the problem is you can't
anneal the precipitate,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.970
because it's metastable.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.950
If you anneal it to
long, it goes away.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.450
OK.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.870
So this was a great
one for computation.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.910
In computation, something
that's metastable,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.000
you can easily make it stable
by not letting the system evolve

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.920
to whatever is stable, and
that's what was done here.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.010
This is a calculated
phase diagram

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:10.150
completely from first principles
with the stable equilibria

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.540
in solid lines and then
the metastable equilibrium,

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.150
this was the precipitant phase.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.620
And so you can just
isolate this thing

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.170
and look at it separately.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.240
OK.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.450
Let me skip that one.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.060
You can use computation
often to prove or disprove

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:37.070
hypotheses in cases where it's
hard to see experimentally.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:42.200
A really ongoing and long story
has been the defect in silicon.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.820
How do vacancies
or interstitials

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.160
look like in silicon?

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.660
The reason that
they're a little odd

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.580
is because it's such
an open structure.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.398
Whereas in a close-packed
metal, a vacancy

00:25:54.398 --> 00:25:56.315
is just taking an atom
out, and interstitials,

00:25:56.315 --> 00:25:59.270
you're just taking putting one
in the interstitial position.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.840
But because in silicon it's such
a close-packed and covalently

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.047
bonded network, every
time you take an atom out,

00:26:05.047 --> 00:26:07.130
you can actually have quite
a bit of rearrangement

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.922
of the other atoms.

00:26:07.922 --> 00:26:11.180
So it's quite an old
problem, and it's probably

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.890
a problem where computation
has made considerable impact.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.100
If you have an idea for how the
vacancy or interstitials should

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.770
look like, you can test
it computationally.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.530
You can calculate its
energy and compare it

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:30.225
to other potential arrangements.

00:26:30.225 --> 00:26:30.725
OK.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.610
This is my last
piece of philosophy.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.500
After that, we'll
start doing real work.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.370
But this is one that if you
didn't remember anything

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.560
from the class except
one thing, this is

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.500
the one I want you to remember.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.180
If you do modeling, and
people will come up to you,

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.730
and they will call
it simulation,

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.632
and modeling is not
the same as simulation.

00:26:58.632 --> 00:26:59.840
You should keep that in mind.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.370
We actually do computation.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.630
Maybe we do modeling.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.580
We rarely ever do simulation.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.640
We sometimes do simulation.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.260
The reason is that
reality is very often

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.760
too complex to simulate.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.410
OK?

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:20.480
So rather, what we do is we
isolate parts of reality.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.170
OK?

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.840
We say, this subset
is important,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.842
and we do computation on that.

00:27:25.842 --> 00:27:27.800
And what that means is
that you will very often

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.420
have to make judgments.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.320
OK?

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.200
Like if you're going
to study corrosion,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.050
let's say you're going to study
corrosion of a high strength

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.160
steel.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.910
There is no way in hell
you're going to simulate that,

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.410
because you don't even know
what the relevant variables are.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.080
You don't even know what the
relevant environments are.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.620
OK?

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.037
So what you're
going to have to do

00:27:47.037 --> 00:27:50.180
is learn a lot about
the signs of corrosion,

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.780
and take one isolated
element, maybe

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.570
surface attack by
chlorine or something

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:03.050
like that or hydrogen going
in and locally embrittling

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.370
the material.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.910
So you will never just take
your high strength steel,

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:12.230
put it in a computer,
and wait for a long time,

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.870
because you don't even know
what environment to impose

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.890
on that system.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.940
OK?

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.140
So rarely do we do simulation
to solve complex problems.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.910
Sometimes, we will
isolate a piece

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.800
and then simulate on
that, but we rarely

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.650
simulate the full reality.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.540
And because of that,
it's really important

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.240
that you know the signs
of the field you work in.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.960
OK?

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.260
You cannot have impact
with computation without

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.440
understanding your field
of application, period,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.550
because you will never
know what to compute.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.110
OK?

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.527
So I think if you
want to remember

00:28:43.527 --> 00:28:45.050
one thing, that's the one.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.020
The hardest part of computing
is knowing what to compute.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.000
OK?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.830
Everybody can learn
molecular dynamics.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.720
Everybody can learn
ab initio methods,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:59.060
but using them in an intelligent
way becomes the hard part.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.430
And I like the quote
from Frank Jensen,

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.410
computers don't solve
problems, people

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:06.770
do, to paraphrase something.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.060
OK.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.830
I'm going to skip this.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.870
I'll let you read this, an
article we put on the web

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.650
from James Langer.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.600
People are trying to
establish computing

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.310
as the third branch of science.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.920
There's experiment, there's
theory, and there's computing,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.440
and it's an interesting article.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.100
OK.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.680
So let me get to
the real science

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.170
that we can do today,
at least a little bit.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:36.470
So the first maybe
a few weeks or so,

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.330
we're going to talk
about energy models.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.830
And the reason we start with
energy models is because I feel

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.220
that, unless you have an
adequate energetic description

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.220
of your material, you really
don't know if what comes out

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.560
of your computations is
actually right or relevant.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:02.330
So typically, people distinguish
empirical energy models

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.680
from ab initio or
quantum mechanical,

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.560
so this is what
we sometimes call

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.760
ab initio, or first principles.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.630
In some sense, in empirical
models, all you do

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.460
is you take some
form for the energy,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.570
and you fit it to any
data you may have,

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.770
and sometimes, that data is
quantum mechanically computed.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.610
In quantum mechanics, you
leave the fitting aside,

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.950
and you go straight
to just solving

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.230
the Schrodinger equation
for whatever problem

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.170
you're trying to solve.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.290
And there are methods
in between which

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.640
are semi-empirical which
are essentially quantum

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.340
mechanical in form but
empirical in the parameters.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.710
Essentially tied binding
fits into these, things

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.035
that the chemists often
do, like MINDO and INDO.

00:30:59.035 --> 00:31:01.930
So these are effectively,
you could think of them

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:06.820
as parameterized Schrodinger
equations almost,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.610
where the overlap integrals
between wave functions

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.370
are not computed but
are parameterized.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.910
So you save a lot of time.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.540
Personally, I believe that
that middlefield is losing

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.190
in importance considerably.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.290
I think if we'd given
this class 10 years ago,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.410
we would have talked
a lot about that.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.450
Because people see
that as a way of like,

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.240
well, it's much
faster than ab initio,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.920
but you keep some of
the accuracy of it.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.750
I think that's less and
less true these days.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.290
You don't keep as much accuracy
as you usually want to,

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.450
and it's not as
much faster anymore.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.730
So while there are
obviously still problems

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.690
where this is important,
more and more people

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.450
just do the ab initio, period.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.980
Computers are cheap these days.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.130
The reason we teach you
about empirical models

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.480
is because, first of
all, you will encounter,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.350
and if you're going to do
really, really large problems,

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.170
they can be quite useful.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.650
And also, they are really great
handle I find to teach you some

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.070
of the essential energy physics
that you need to deal with when

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.220
studying different materials,
and so that's why I spend 2,

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.475
2 1/2 lectures on
empirical models.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.340
OK.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.130
And so obviously, keep
the obviously in mind,

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.140
that if you work
with potentials,

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.660
you have no information
about electrons.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.660
You just have energies as
a function of position.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.433
If you work with semi-empirical
and quantum mechanics,

00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:40.725
you also have more information.

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:43.950
You know something about
the electronic structure

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.120
of the material.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.080
Which one is best, I think
that's an irrelevant question,

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.580
depends what you can afford.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.080
OK.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.680
So essentially,
what you want if you

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.667
want to do an empirical
modeling method

00:33:10.667 --> 00:33:13.000
is that you want to have the
energy as a function of all

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.700
the nuclear coordinates.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.430
That already itself
implies an assumption,

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.950
because the energy is actually
a function of the nuclear

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.260
and the electronic coordinates.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.830
Typically, what we do
is we variationally

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.830
remove the electronic
coordinates,

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.630
and that's essentially
what's called

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.610
the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.170
If you think if
your atom-- if you

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.130
have a bunch of atoms together.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:42.850
So you have a set of coordinates
that describe the positions.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.940
People think that the energy
is uniquely determined

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:56.260
by that set of coordinates,
but that's actually not true.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.000
Because you have electronic
states, and in many cases,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.390
for a given state
of the nuclei, you

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.090
can have multiple
electronic states.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.330
OK?

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.960
There'll be a ground state, but
you can be in excited states

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.429
as well.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.550
What the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation essentially

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.570
assumes is that, for any
set of nuclear coordinates,

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:23.090
you are always in the
electronic ground state.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:27.850
So ER is derived from
ER psi by essentially

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.969
variationally removing psi
by minimizing over psi.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.070
OK?

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.969
So what's the physical
implementation here?

00:34:41.258 --> 00:34:43.780
If you're in a
stationary configuration,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.540
and you wait long enough,
this is probably OK.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.960
If your atoms sit there
frozen in some position,

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.760
if you wait long
enough, the electrons

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.820
will go to the ground state,
especially when you're

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.040
at 0 temperature.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.372
Where is can wreak havoc is
in certain molds of dynamics,

00:35:01.372 --> 00:35:02.830
because what you're
really assuming

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.120
is that, if you move your
atoms, your electrons follow

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.110
infinitely fast.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.620
OK?

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.980
Because if you move
the atom a little bit,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.620
the energy change
is the energy change

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.440
when the electrons relax
immediately to the ground

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.090
state, as you move the atoms.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.070
OK?

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.450
That's essentially the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.992
So when is this not
going to be true?

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.130
It's when the atoms
move really fast,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.280
or the electrons
move really slow,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.092
and there are cases like that.

00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:37.550
This is one of
these approximations

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.980
that we want to believe is
always true, because it's

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.510
very hard to do anything else.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.210
So we kind of kid
ourselves, because it's

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.520
very hard to verify as well.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.020
But there are long-lived
excited states in materials.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.405
There are defects in
semiconductors, for example,

00:35:53.405 --> 00:35:56.540
EL2 in gallium arsenide
was a famous one

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.970
that has very long-lived
excited states, where

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.640
there are essentially two
Born-Oppenheimer surfaces.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.400
Let's call one the
ground state one,

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.100
and then there's another one
that's the excited state one.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.440
And the interesting
thing was they gave you

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.580
different nuclear coordinates.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.980
So if you minimized it under
one equipotential surface

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.522
and under the other
one, you ended up

00:36:15.522 --> 00:36:17.240
in a different
nuclear configuration.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.410
So you see then,
you have a problem.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.330
You can find the lowest energy
configuration of the nuclei,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.700
unless you know what
the electrons do.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.480
So you now have a
coupled problem.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.850
OK?

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.790
So that's a
non-obvious violation

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.130
of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.990
In fast dynamics, things
that move fast, like protons.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:42.470
The lightest nucleus or
protons can move very fast,

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.680
and in some cases, the electrons
won't follow fast enough.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.690
In insulators, let's say
you studied diffusion

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.880
of charged ions in insulators.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.070
OK?

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.560
So I work on battery materials.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.020
It's all about lithium
plus diffusion,

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.430
lithium ions diffuse.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.180
Well, if the ion diffuses--
if the iron hops very fast,

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.460
but I'm in an insulator,
maybe the electron

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.510
won't follow fast enough.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.010
OK?

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.320
So I'm going away from the
Born-Oppenheimer surface there.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:13.820
OK?

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.748
So this problem actually
appears more than you think.

00:37:16.748 --> 00:37:18.790
It's just that we don't
know how to deal with it.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:23.840
So we like, shush, remove
it from our thoughts.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.900
The other obvious violation
of Born-Oppenheimer

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:31.160
is when you're at
nonzero temperature.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.110
When you're at
nonzero temperature,

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:37.670
you have a finite probability
to actually occupy

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.120
the higher level electronic
citations, so the higher energy

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.010
electronics states.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.200
That's not a really big problem.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.020
It is technically a violation
of the Born-Oppenheimer

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:51.410
approximation, but essentially,
it's easy to solve.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.230
You can replace this minimum.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.500
So minimizing it
by statistically

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.740
averaging over the right
levels by literally

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.490
doing a statistical weighting
of how the levels are populated.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.950
Then, they do a statistical
mechanics approach,

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:09.343
and we'll talk much
more about these things

00:38:09.343 --> 00:38:10.760
when we talk about
coarse graining

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.090
methods in the later
part of the course.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:19.140
So temperature isn't a big
deal for Born-Oppenheimer.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.640
OK.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:28.150
So here's what we're
going to do on potentials.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.910
There are as many different
potentials as there are people.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.410
Everybody has
their favorite one.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.270
So we're going to
pick and choose,

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.190
and I'm mainly going
to pick and choose

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.790
based on the materials physics
I can teach you with them.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.750
So we're going to talk
about a few particular forms

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.860
and the physical limitations
that they introduce,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.530
and I'm going to start
with pair potentials,

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.450
because they're the obvious one.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.460
That'll be today, and then
that'll obviously lead us,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.690
the failures of those will lead
us into many body potentials

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.730
and pair functionals.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.380
This one will be
particularly relevant

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:11.160
for covalent delocalized
materials, like metals,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.510
and this is for delocalized--

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.440
sorry.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.420
Sorry, covalent localized.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.470
So we're mainly going to talk
about the form of these things.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.887
I'm not going to
spend a whole lot

00:39:25.887 --> 00:39:31.730
of time talking about the
detailed parameters you put in.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:32.230
OK.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.700
So here's pair potentials.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.530
Obviously, what are
you really saying

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.780
when you use pair potentials
to model something?

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.810
You're saying that, if I have
a bunch of atoms together,

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.340
I can sum their energy
from pairwise interactions.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.860
So you're saying that this
interaction between these two

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.980
atoms has nothing to do with
whether this atom or that atom

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.610
is present.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.340
That's essentially the
physics of what you're saying.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.320
You're summing the energy.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.220
In some cases, you take a
constant, and then simply

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.350
a sum of interaction
potentials that only

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:20.741
depend on the distance
between two atoms.

00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:24.350
Pair potentials pretty much
always have the same form.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:32.930
They are attractive at
intermediate to long distance,

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.850
and they are repulsive
at short distance.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.810
And they have to be
repulsive at short distance,

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.640
because otherwise, your
system collapses into itself.

00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:48.496
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:40:48.496 --> 00:40:49.740
I left my phone.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:50.823
I just don't see it.

00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:53.240
Sorry to interrupt.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.468
PROFESSOR: You left what?

00:40:54.468 --> 00:40:55.260
AUDIENCE: My phone.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:55.827
I'm sorry.

00:40:55.827 --> 00:40:57.160
PROFESSOR: I didn't see a phone.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.827
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:01.560
Sorry.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.370
PROFESSOR: No problem.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.870
OK.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:14.290
Every lecture will have
something like that.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.550
Something odd happens.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.580
We do it deliberately.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.760
No.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.770
One issue, practical
issue with potentials,

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.480
is that you have
to truncate them.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.070
OK?

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.010
Because you want to
keep this pairwise

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.900
distance not out to infinity.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.880
Most potential is just
the form they have.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.750
They slowly decay, and people
do all kinds of tricks.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.150
The problem is if
you say, I'm only

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.450
going to truncate
up to here, that you

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.850
have this discontinuity.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.770
Let me see if I can
make a wide slide,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.814
if I remember how to do this.

00:41:46.814 --> 00:41:49.290
Ah, magic.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.890
OK.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.610
So let's say I truncate
the potential here

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:56.600
at this distance.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.850
Then essentially, my potential
really looks like this.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.120
I have this discontinuity in
it which is not very good.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.220
Because whenever atoms move
in and out of this range,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.400
they actually have a
strong energy jump,

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.360
as they move in and
out of that range.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.740
So people do all
kinds of tricks.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:23.310
You can smooth this, like
attach some spline to it that

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.970
smooths this out to zero.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.742
Sometimes, you want
to have literally zero

00:42:29.742 --> 00:42:30.450
at some distance.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.180
Sometimes, you also
like zero derivative,

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.140
so you have continuous forces.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.300
Some people use
shifted potentials

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.040
which is kind of cute.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.690
If you know that this has some
value, let's say epsilon here,

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:47.180
you just shift the
potential up by epsilon.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.400
So now, it's zero
at your cutoff,

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.900
but of course, the
force would still

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.908
be discontinuous, because the
force would be the derivative.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:57.990
OK.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.170
The most simple potential form
that you'll sometimes see used

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.800
is the Lennard-Jones
potential which

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.210
has an R to the 6th which
is the attractive part.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.710
OK?

00:43:20.307 --> 00:43:21.890
That gives you the
attractions and has

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.740
the negative sign in front,
and the R to the 12th

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.000
which gives you the repulsion.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:38.700
The R to the 6th
term can actually

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.890
be physically justified.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:45.030
It comes from the interaction
between fluctuating dipoles.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.000
If you have an atom here with
its electron cloud and an atom

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.460
here, and if these
are inert atoms,

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.300
so with filled electron shell,
so there's no covalent bonding

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.540
going on with them.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.190
So these are either ions
with a filled shell,

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.830
or they're noble gases.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:05.400
Then, there is no direct
covalent interaction,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.890
so the interaction you get
is from fluctuating dipoles.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:12.180
So at some point,
there's a dipole

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.390
that, just from fluctuations,
that sets up here,

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:22.040
and that will induce a dipole
in the other electron cloud.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.770
And so the interaction
between these dipoles

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.310
and these dipoles, if
you actually look at it,

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.990
gives you an R to the 6th.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.860
So this piece is
physically justifiable,

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.752
and that's where
Lennard-Jones got it from.

00:44:38.752 --> 00:44:40.210
It's essentially
the form of what's

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.730
called a Van der Waals
interaction which

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:46.060
is the interaction
between inner shells.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.266
So where does the R to the
12th come from, you think?

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:57.540
Obviously, you need
something steep to get that.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.660
Otherwise, the ions
fly into each other.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.060
You need this steep
repulsive part

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.530
when the ions come
very close together,

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.940
and essentially what the physics
of it is the Pauli repulsion.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.760
As the electron clouds come
into each other, remember,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.280
the electrons cannot occupy
exactly the same quantum state.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.280
And so as you bring
them closer, you're

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.950
almost forcing them to occupy
the same quantum state,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.180
but why R to the 12th?

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:28.390
It's really because it's
the square of R to the 6th.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.220
There is no physical
justification

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.010
for R to the 12th.

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.750
Lennard-Jones used
it, because it

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.860
makes the math of some things
you want to do with it easy,

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.350
because it's the
square of R to the 6th.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:46.060
So if you like R or the 10th,
R to the 14th, R to the 16th,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.672
go ahead.

00:45:48.672 --> 00:45:50.630
People always take the
Lennard-Jones potential,

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:52.270
because it's there.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:55.630
And like I said, the R to
the 6th, I grant you that.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.950
Maybe you should keep that.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.812
That is a true Van
der Waals interaction,

00:45:58.812 --> 00:46:00.520
but the R to the 12th,
there is no reason

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.350
that it should be R to the 12th.

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:02.920
OK?

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.900
Anything, sometimes you actually
want steeper potentials,

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.290
so you make it like R to the
20 or something or whatever.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.490
OK.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.280
The other thing is that
people use the Lennard-Jones

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.160
potentials to attract
atoms together

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.090
that has nothing to do with
Van der Waals interaction,

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.040
to actually look at
things that almost

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.032
have some covalent interaction.

00:46:26.032 --> 00:46:27.490
And then there's
actually no reason

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.680
to keep the R of the 6th.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.250
OK?

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.667
Because the R to
the 6th is really

00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:36.760
only physically justifiable
for Van der Waals terms.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.180
OK.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.930
The interesting thing
about Lennard-Jones,

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.472
it's actually the
simplest potential,

00:46:42.472 --> 00:46:45.400
because it only
has two parameters.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.190
There's essentially A and
B, or if you renormalize

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:52.500
the potential, there's
an energy scale,

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.105
and there's a length scale.

00:46:54.105 --> 00:46:56.430
So you see, if you
write it in this form,

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.250
you see that the
potential is in units

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.870
of epsilon, and the
length, or the sigma which

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.110
is the distance--

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.830
I'm sorry, the R which is the
distance is in units of sigma.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:08.760
OK?

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.580
So what that means is
that there's essentially

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.070
only one Lennard-Jones
system in the world.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.880
You will see tabulated
Lennard-Jones parameters

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.110
for a lot of materials,
but if you think of it,

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.690
the energy scale
of your potential

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:28.170
sets the temperature
scale of the system.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:33.210
And the length scale sets
the volume or therefore

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.080
the pressure scale.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.080
So if you take one
Lennard-Jones system

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:41.280
at a given temperature
and pressure,

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.970
that will always be the
same as a Lennard-Jones

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.340
system without the parameters
but at another temperature

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.280
and pressure.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.850
So there's a unique
transformation

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.590
going between all
Lennard-Jones systems.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:53.418
Yes, sir.

00:47:53.418 --> 00:47:56.764
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.790
PROFESSOR: No.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:04.250
Sometimes, people leave
out that factor of 2.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.900
I'm sorry?

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.246
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.240
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.800
I think the reason
the factor 2 is there,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.050
if you differentiate
it, and that way you

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.480
find the minimum is
exactly at sigma.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:22.980
OK?

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.030
Because if you differentiate
the 12, you get a factor of 12.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:30.190
If you differentiate
the 6, you get a 6.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:35.110
You could leave 2 out, but
then sigma is not the value

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.190
where the potential is minimum.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:42.850
That's the reason people put
sigma there, because I think--

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.630
I may be wrong-- but I think
in this form, this is sigma.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.150
OK?

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:50.300
And I actually think
that this is epsilon,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.590
but I should verify that.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.880
So there is essentially
only one Lennard-Jones.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.963
Ah, there's Lennard-Jones.

00:48:58.963 --> 00:49:01.640
I forgot his picture.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.140
I think it's sir now, Sir
Lennard-Jones, I think.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:06.640
OK.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.760
Usually, two parameters is
just not enough in a potential,

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.470
and the reason is
that usually you

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:31.100
want to mimic at least three
properties of a material.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:35.410
Its length scale which is its
largest parameter, its energy

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.350
scale which you can think of
as its cohesive energy which

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.690
is the potential
depth, but you also

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.780
want to get its
elasticity right.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.530
OK?

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.890
And so that's three
fundamental properties

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.290
to get right, because
its elasticity tells you

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:54.640
its response to
any perturbations.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.370
And the problem is that a
Lennard-Jones potential only

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.660
has two parameters.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.340
You cannot fit three
things with two parameters.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.480
So most people will go to
things with three parameters,

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.140
usually, so they can get
these three things right.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.540
And one classic is
a Morse potential

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.530
which has D which
sets the energy scale,

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:20.000
R0 which sets the length
scale, and alpha which

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.470
sets the elasticity scale.

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:24.440
Because you can see
alpha sets in some sense

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.090
the curvature of the potential.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.810
It's what you multiply with
the distance differential.

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:30.530
OK?

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.695
So alpha will be a measure
of the elastic behavior.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.100
In particular, in oxides,
the form that's most popular

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.210
is what's called a Born-Mayor
or a Buckingham potential which

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:48.700
is essentially a decaying
exponential, a Van der Waals

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.900
term, and then the second
order term in Van der Waals

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.560
perturbation theory which is
the R of the 8th parameter.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.390
The weird thing
about this potential

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.220
that you have to be
somewhat careful about

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:10.630
is that it diverges at short
distances if you plot it.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.140
If you plot the
exponential, that

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.250
goes to a finite value
of A when R is 0.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.700
So the exponential to
something like this,

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.000
and this is A-- it's actually
a lot steeper in reality.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.333
Typically, A is very large, but
these terms, these R to the 6th

00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:32.250
and the R to the 8th--

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.340
1 over R to the 6th and 1 over
R to the 8th diverge and R

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.480
goes to 0.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.580
So they, on the other
hand, look like this, where

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:41.710
this goes to minus infinity.

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:46.740
So when you add the two up,
you get something like this.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:49.840
I'm sorry.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.730
This is supposed to go down.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:57.300
So if you look only up to here,
this potential looks fine.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.190
But if you go past it, if you
in some sense go into the core,

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:07.100
the potential diverges, and
you may think that's silly.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.990
You never go there,
but you sometimes

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.020
do because of numerical issues.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:15.440
Sometimes, what happens
in say a simulation is

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.560
that, when you start--

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.690
let's say you do something
molecular dynamics which

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:24.860
is essentially evolving atoms
according to their force.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.560
You may start in a configuration
very far from equilibrium.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.660
So in the initial steps, atoms
move with tremendous force,

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.480
and so because of that, they
can literally just overshoot

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.190
and shoot into each other.

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:39.050
And what you see
is that actually

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.570
the state with two atoms
on top of each other

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:45.150
is a highly bonded state
in this kind of potential.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.490
So you will never escape it.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.220
You were really just put
atoms on top of each other.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.800
And trust me, if you work
with Born-Mayer potentials,

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.750
and you're not careful,
you will see that.

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:55.760
You will see atoms sitting
on top of each other,

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.170
exactly because of this problem.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.250
OK.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:04.422
I got some Morse potential
parameters out of a book.

00:53:04.422 --> 00:53:05.630
It's probably rather useless.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:07.400
Nobody would use this
anymore for metals

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.550
to be honest, because I'll
show you a bit later why.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:12.780
These pair potentials are
not very good for metals.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:13.556
Yes.

00:53:13.556 --> 00:53:16.958
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.820
PROFESSOR: You're asking
about how to calculate.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:32.358 --> 00:53:33.650
PROFESSOR: Let me come to that.

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:37.370
That's a question I will
specifically address, but thank

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.870
you.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:44.020
I wanted to show
you the difference

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:49.340
between a few potentials
for a specific bond.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:54.190
This is the CH bond in
methane, and so they're all

00:53:54.190 --> 00:54:00.520
fitted to have the same bonding
energy and the same modulus.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.860
So the same bond distance,
the same bonding energy,

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.460
and same modulus, and
this is the exact curve

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.970
in the solid line.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:13.810
The dash dash dotted
is the Morse potential.

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:17.770
That's actually the one that's
very close to the exact line.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.770
Let's see if I get this right.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.480
This is just a
harmonic potential.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.380
So this is something
like what they call P2.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:34.200
This is sort of K times
delta R-squared, where

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.500
delta R is the distance
away from the equilibrium

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.960
bound in geometry, and P4
is a 4th order polynomial.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:46.140
So that would be K
plus let's say L delta

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.230
R cubed to the 4th power.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:50.910
And I think the
interesting thing

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.130
is that near the minimum
they all look the same.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.480
They pretty much have to.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.030
They have the same
position in the minimum,

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.150
and they have the
same curvature.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:00.870
OK?

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:02.880
So if you're only
going to be looking

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.540
at very short displacements
around the equilibrium,

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.357
actually just your
quadratic is fine,

00:55:09.357 --> 00:55:10.440
and you'll see that often.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.110
People who model
small deformations

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.670
in organic systems
in polymers and so

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.030
will often just use
spring models, essentially

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:18.640
a harmonic potential.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.200
So to decide what
potential you need,

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.000
you should think
about how far you want

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.010
to go away from equilibrium.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.440
If you go very far away
from equilibrium, obviously,

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.980
this Morse potential
does a fine job.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.080
If you stay very
close to equilibrium,

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.790
you may not want to
put in that effort.

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:39.240
It's much easier to
work with a spring model

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.610
than to actually work
with a Morse potential.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.413
It's much faster to
evaluate a quadratic.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:53.440
I always thought I should
put a section in my lectures

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.000
on how to fit potentials, and
every time, I look up papers,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.980
and I can never find
anything systematic.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.320
So I think the rule
is you fit to anything

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.810
you can get your hands on.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:09.190
And as we'll point out
later more carefully,

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:12.730
since potentials only
have a limited region

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.710
of applicability,
you want to fit

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.420
as close as possible
to the things

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.560
you're going to calculate,
to the environment

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.620
you're going to calculate,
but so in theory, that

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.030
could be anything.

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:23.800
There's the obvious candidates.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.200
You always want to get the
length scale and the energy

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.360
scale pretty much right and
the stiffness, here sort

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.510
of obvious.

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:36.790
In some cases, you want to get
low symmetry environment right.

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:41.380
So if you only fit to
crystal structures,

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:45.310
you may have very poor
reproduction of low symmetry

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:51.110
things, like surface energies
or what goes on in a liquid.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.788
And so in some cases, people
explicitly fit to that.

00:56:53.788 --> 00:56:55.330
I wouldn't worry
too much about this.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.913
This is going to
become a lot clearer,

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.810
as I talk to you about
the physics that's

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:04.790
missing in pair potentials
and how you correct to that.

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:05.290
OK.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:12.190
So I tried to find
what I thought

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:16.150
is maybe the first example
of computational modeling

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.490
with potentials.

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:21.580
It's probably not the first, but
I think maybe one of the first

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.430
that was done on computer.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.700
This was done by
Vineyard's group,

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:31.870
and it's essentially studying
radiation damage in copper.

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:35.350
This is from 1960.

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:37.930
I don't know if you remember
punch cards for computers.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:39.910
I think this is from
before punch cards.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:46.960
But they managed to program
a small molecular dynamics,

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.400
and essentially
what they're doing

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.670
is they have a crystal of
copper, and they're shooting--

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:56.460
I think they're
shooting some ions in it

00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.360
to actually see the orbit that
the radiation damage falls.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.610
So you knock out atoms, and
you show the displacement.

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:06.180
Ironically, this is a simulation
people still do these days.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:13.500
Molecular dynamics on
radiation damage, so 1960.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.520
OK.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:19.890
So let me talk a little
about the obvious problems

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:22.650
with pair potentials, and
this is one of the things

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:26.055
that we're going to then
show you in the lab.

00:58:26.055 --> 00:58:27.930
We are actually going
to make you demonstrate

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.320
this in the lab, and
once you understand

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.780
the physical limitations
of pair potential,

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.410
you'll see that the solutions
which is pair functional

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:39.630
methods or cluster
potential are actually quite

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:42.370
obvious why they came about.

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:44.670
And when I talk about
failures of pair potentials,

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:47.220
I don't talk about
failures of the parameters.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.480
I talk about
failures of the form,

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.930
and there's a lot of
people who say, well,

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:54.750
if this doesn't work, I just
need to change my parameters

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:55.710
in my potential.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:57.690
There are certain things
that you can never

00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.570
get right with pair
potentials, because they

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:05.340
are in violation of the
particular form which

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.820
is a pairwise interaction.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.530
So one is, obviously, that
pair potentials count bonds.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.320
That's what you
should keep in mind.

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.150
They really essentially sum--

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:19.980
the cohesive energy
on an atom is largely

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.650
determined by how many things
are around it, because it

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:24.490
literally sums bonds around it.

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:27.940
It doesn't care much about
the organization of atoms.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.910
So if you take this
triangle, let's say

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:37.510
these bonds are
one Angstrom, or I

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:42.430
take this chain, where the
bonds are one Angstrom.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.930
OK?

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:45.000
Here, I have four atoms,
here I have three,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.470
but there are three
bonds in each case.

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:49.590
These have essentially
the same energy

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:51.660
in a pair potential model.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.220
OK?

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.770
The only thing that
would distinguish them

00:59:55.770 --> 01:00:02.700
is longer range
interactions, but that's not

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:06.220
the physics that in many
cases makes this different.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:06.993
OK?

01:00:06.993 --> 01:00:09.160
The physics that in many
cases makes this different,

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.710
for example, could
be angular or bonding

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.170
or could be that
the presence of this

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:17.950
truly influences the
bond between these two.

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:22.120
And we'll actually show you
how to solve both problems.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.890
They're actually
different problems that

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:25.300
lead to different solutions.

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:33.480
Another nice example, if you
take a ethylene molecule,

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.880
let's say you were
trying to model

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.300
that with pair potentials.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:45.370
If I flap these bonds here,
so I bend open the hydrogens,

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:47.880
that really doesn't
cost me any energy,

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.420
if I have a pair potential.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:49.920
OK?

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.650
Because the pair potential
just measures this distance

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.160
and this distance.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.510
So if I just flap this open,
that distance stays the same.

01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.120
OK?

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.220
Only if you had some
indirect interaction

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.250
between these
hydrogens would you

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:08.820
pick up that energy difference.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.340
But you see, if you
made a potential

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.880
between the hydrogens, you'd be
putting the wrong physics in.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.707
Because the reason that energy
changes, as I change that band,

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.290
has nothing to do
with the interaction

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:20.940
between the hydrogens.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:24.720
But it has all to do with the
hybridization of the carbon,

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.400
that the carbon is sp2
hybridized and one certain bond

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.510
angles.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:30.210
OK?

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:34.800
So it's not because you can
fix it with pair potentials

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.850
that you fix it right.

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:42.230
OK.

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.470
The other thing you will see
is, if you use pair potentials,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:48.650
and you look say for low
energy crystal structures,

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:52.710
you will almost always end
up in close-packed systems.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:55.310
And the reason is that
in pair potential models,

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.240
atoms try to maximize their
coordination, because really

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.320
you sum the energy pairwise
coming from atoms around you.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.090
So if you have a
negative bonding energy

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:10.010
with atoms around
you, you try to get

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:13.430
as many as you can
around you, so you

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.040
will maximize coordination.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.610
The ground states of most
potential models for elements

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:24.520
are HCP Hexagonal Close-Packed
and FCC Face-Centered

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.610
Close-Packed.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:26.360
OK?

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.640
So it's extremely hard
to stabilize things

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.240
like a diamond cubic structure
which is an open structure.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.990
I don't know if you
have a picture for it.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:42.290
The other thing which
is maybe more obvious,

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:46.445
but pair potentials are
not stable against shear,

01:02:46.445 --> 01:02:48.320
and now you could argue
most materials aren't

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.400
stable against shear.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.960
But if I take the
square of atoms--

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.480
let's say this is just
a piece of a lattice.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:07.280
OK-- if I shear this, I
can shear this and keep

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.140
all these distances the same.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.480
So in a nearest
neighbor pair potential,

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.215
all the energy has not changed.

01:03:20.215 --> 01:03:21.590
So if the energy
has not changed,

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:25.340
that means that my elastic
constant in shear is 0.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.150
OK?

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:29.990
Now, you could say, this is why
real materials on form square

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:32.330
lattices and simple
cubic lattice, and that's

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.560
actually true.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.290
But a real material has
some amount of resistance

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:40.050
against shear, even in
a square configuration.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.780
And here you see
by construction,

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:47.000
it doesn't have any resistance.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.500
OK.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:07.490
What I'm going to do is
try to break down what

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:12.440
in different materials classes,
like metals or organic solids,

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.560
what the failures
of pair potentials,

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.190
and then we'll go into what
the remedies are for that.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:25.040
So in metals, the main
thing is this problem.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.230
That if you do a
pair potential model,

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:29.990
and you look at the bonding
energy of this red atom,

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.940
it's really
essentially six times

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.840
the single bond energy of
the red with the white one.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.080
And so that's why
for pair potentials,

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.070
people say that cohesive
energy scales with Z which

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:44.240
is the coordination number.

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:56.580
And if you do quantum mechanics
or even more approximate theory

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.710
but that have the essentials
of hybridization in them,

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:03.120
you find that actually for
metals-- and with metals,

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.570
I mean things that have
covalent delocalized bonding,

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.690
which you call
metallic bonding--

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:13.330
the cohesive energy of an atom
goes like the square root of Z.

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:13.830
OK?

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:16.060
So it's not linear in Z at all.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.780
So if you have more
bonds, you start

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.240
gaining less and
less incrementally,

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.230
and you can see that.

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.500
I made a picture here.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.130
This is out of a, I think,
what's really a great article,

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.750
if you want to read
more about this.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.810
It's a review article on
the embedded atom method.

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:35.280
We'll put this on the restricted
side of the course website.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.520
This is actually for
nickel, the cohesive energy

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.050
per atom as a function of
the coordination it's in.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:47.740
So of course, 12 here,
this is the FCC solid.

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.000
2 is the dimer.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.823
So this is just two
atoms in the gas phase,

01:05:53.823 --> 01:05:54.990
and what do you think is 11?

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:00.460
How do you get 11?

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:08.750
This is actually
experimental data.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:15.000
11 is from the vacancy
formation energy.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.240
If you make a vacancy in a
crystal, the atoms around it

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.060
are 11-fold coordinated
instead of 12.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.270
In FCC, you have
12-fold coordination,

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:27.240
but if you take an atom away,
those atoms around there

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.710
have 11-fold coordination.

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:30.750
So this comes from the
vacancy coordination.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:33.750
Now, there's three points here.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.378
They drew a square
root through them.

01:06:36.378 --> 01:06:37.920
You probably could
draw other things,

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.670
but what we do know
from quantum mechanics

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:42.720
is that essentially the first
order is square root of Z

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.540
behavior and now Z behavior.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.930
You can also see
that in silicon.

01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:50.610
This is a slightly
confusing graph,

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:56.190
but this is the energy per
bond in red for silicon

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:58.460
in different coordinations.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:06:59.270
OK?

01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:04.820
So what you see is that
the energy per bond

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.540
actually goes down as
you make more bonds.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.240
So even though as you
coordinate an atom

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.730
with more atoms around it,
the total cohesive energy

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.200
may go down.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.570
If you divide that energy
by the number of bonds,

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:20.190
that number becomes
smaller and smaller.

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.690
OK?

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:23.690
It's almost like an atom
in a covalent bonding

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:27.440
has only so much
bonding power to give,

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.540
and if it only
bonds to one atom,

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.030
it gives all its bonding
power to that one atom.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:33.620
If it has to bond
to a lot, it has

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:36.770
to divide that
between all those.

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:39.200
So this is an important
concept to remember,

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.640
that in covalent
materials, cohesive energy

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.070
is not linear in coordination.

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:51.250
Bonding strength gets weaker,
as you add more bonds,

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.240
and we'll come back to that.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.020
This is important
when you go between--

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.690
when you make potentials in
one coordination environment

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:00.220
and start using
them in another one.

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.550
Here's a quantum mechanical
result for aluminum.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.880
So this is the
cohesive energy, again,

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.960
as a function of the
coordination number.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.870
So this is actually
a calculation,

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:25.160
and again what you see is that,
even though as you coordinate

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.529
more the cohesive
energy goes down,

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:29.182
but it doesn't go down linear.

01:08:29.182 --> 01:08:30.890
If you want to think
of it, the increment

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.859
you're getting
from adding a bond

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.930
starts getting
smaller and smaller.

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:42.310
If you go from one
to two, you could say

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:44.140
this is your bonding energy.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.700
This is the extra
energy you get.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:50.870
If you go from 11 to 12,
all you gain is this.

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.380
So the bond energy, when
you go from the 11 to 12

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:57.399
is much smaller than the bonding
energy when you go from 1 to 2.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.930
OK?

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.439
So the cohesive energy
with coordination

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.689
is a convex function.

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:07.300
That's important
to keep in mind.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.970
And of course, you cannot get
that with pair potentials.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:12.550
With pair potentials, this
will essentially look linear.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.840
Now, what's the slope of
it in pair potentials?

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.100
It's a trick question.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.470
What's the slope of that line?

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.293
Well, Z's the coordinate, so
I need the factor in front.

01:09:41.293 --> 01:09:43.200
See, the problem
is you don't know.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.220
This is in the end the
fundamental problem.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.220
It depends on where you fit it.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.850
If you fit from 11 to 12--

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:55.850
if you fit from 11 to 12,
then this is your slope.

01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:58.370
Then, you're going
to have this curve.

01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:02.260
If you fit from 1 to 2, you're
going to have this curve.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:09.110
And do you see that they
really give substantial error

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.720
when you go away from the
coordination in which you fit?

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:20.690
I'm going to show you
that with the last result.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:23.600
This is basically
saying the same thing.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.422
What I took here, this is out
of Anders Karlsson's paper

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:28.880
which is on our reference list,
which we've put on the web.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.610
This is a great review
paper on potentials,

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.920
and not just pair potentials.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.943
And we give with every main
topic-- not every lecture--

01:10:36.943 --> 01:10:39.110
with every main topic, we
have a list of references,

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.720
and they just go on the
Additional Materials

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.430
on the Stellar website.

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:46.790
This is the pair
potential for copper

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:50.430
fitted to different properties.

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:54.720
The lowest one is the one fitted
to the dimer, to the molecule.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.310
So this is just a
copper-copper dimer.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:05.877
You see, it's the
strongest of them all.

01:11:05.877 --> 01:11:07.960
It's the strongest of all
the potentials, and why,

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.160
because there's only one bond.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:10.970
OK?

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:15.100
You remember, all the bonding
energy goes in that one bond.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.250
The equation of state,
that's essentially

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:22.420
looking at the cohesive energy
of the solid as a function

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.130
of lattice parameter.

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:33.477
So this one, that's
almost the smallest one.

01:11:33.477 --> 01:11:34.185
That's the solid.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.960
See, a lot smaller,
because you're counting now

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.380
bond strength in coordination
12, where every bond is weaker.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.860
So you try to map that
onto a pair potential,

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.665
and you get, in some sense,
a much weaker interaction

01:11:51.665 --> 01:11:54.500
per pair.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.885
And what Anders Karlsson did, he
also extracted it from phonons.

01:11:57.885 --> 01:11:58.760
This is actually one.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.610
It's really small
and from defects,

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.677
and the defect one even
has a different minimum.

01:12:03.677 --> 01:12:05.510
Actually, they all have
a different minimum.

01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:13.310
So what this is telling you,
what I'm trying to demonstrate,

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:17.690
is that for metals and for
anything that's actually

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:22.520
covalent, but this is worse
for covalent delocalized,

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.220
your potential is extremely
environment-dependent.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.950
It's essentially
coordination-dependent.

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:28.610
OK?

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:32.990
And we show you in
the next lecture

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:37.850
how that shows up in
certain physical properties

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:39.350
and then how you solve that.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:42.110
Because turns out, there's
a very elegant solution

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:44.840
to the problem, and I
think you can already see

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.550
where we're going to take this.

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:48.890
The problem is that
our bonding energy

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:52.530
is linear in coordination
with a pair potential.

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:55.190
So all we need to do
to fix this problem is

01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:58.760
to make it nonlinear,
and that leads you

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.760
into what are called pair
functionals, rather than pair

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.020
potentials.

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.960
And things like there's a
whole class of methods, things

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.140
like the embedded atom
method, glue models,

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.480
effective medium theory, they
all go be different names,

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.630
are essentially pair
functional models.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.340
There are still
things that count

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.090
the coordination around you
in some form or another.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:23.450
It's just that they make
the energy evolve nonlinear

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:26.692
with that coordination, and
they're very elegant methods.

01:13:26.692 --> 01:13:28.400
They're still empirical
methods, but very

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.610
elegant methods that solve
the essential problem of pair

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:34.410
potentials without
a lot of extra work,

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.862
and so we'll talk
about that on Thursday.

01:13:37.862 --> 01:13:38.570
So I'll end here.

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:40.153
I'll be happy, if
there are questions,

01:13:40.153 --> 01:13:41.813
I'd be happy to take questions.

01:13:41.813 --> 01:13:43.730
Professor Marzari and I
will be here for a few

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:46.310
more minutes, if there's anybody
that has questions about how

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:49.540
the course will run in general.

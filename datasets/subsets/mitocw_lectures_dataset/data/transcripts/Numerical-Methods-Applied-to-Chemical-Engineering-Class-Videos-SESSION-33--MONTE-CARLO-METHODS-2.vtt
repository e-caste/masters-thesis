WILLIAM GREEN: All
right, so today we're

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.860
going to keep on
working on stochastic.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.280
And I guess maybe we start--

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.840
if you guys have questions
from the homework set,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.010
since I'm sure you're thinking
about that a lot right now.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.284
Are there any questions?

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.000
Should I take this to mean
that you have it completely

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.583
under control?

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:49.780
That's good.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.330
All right-- so since we
have Monte Carlo integration

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.700
metropolis totally
under control,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.140
let's talk about time dependent
probability distributions.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:16.420
So in many situations,
we'd like to predict

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.520
what's going to happen
in an experiment.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.210
And the fundamental
equations of that experiment

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.590
are time dependent, so we have
different things happening

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.890
at different times.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.980
And so we really
want to know what

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.178
d dt of the probability
of some observable--

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:39.070
this is going to
equal something.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.986
Let me fix the lights.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.140
All right, so we want
some equation like this.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.430
And then when you actually
made your measurement,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.622
you'd be sampling from P.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:59.613
So probability of
the observables--

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.250
and so if you made
the measurement,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.750
you'd have a certain probability
that you observe something.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.291
And you made a
different measurement,

00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.680
you'd have same probability
if you made the measurement

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.360
at this time.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.270
So this is going to be
probability of the observable

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.580
depending on the time.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.790
And you made the measurements
at different times.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.414
So let's conceptually
think about this.

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:24.560
Suppose we had a box.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.130
And it had a uranium atom
in it that's radioactive.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.390
And it can decay.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.640
So we look in the box.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.650
And at time zero,
I look in there.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.267
And there's the uranium
atom sitting there nicely.

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:37.350
And I go away for a while.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.850
They come back.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.641
And I open the box.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:39.742
And I look again later.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:42.200
And there's some probability
that the uranium atom is still

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.860
there.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.360
And there's some
probability that it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.930
fissioned during the time
and it's gone, right?

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.360
OK so there must be
some kind of equation

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.390
like this, how the probability
that the uranium atom

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.150
is still there in the box.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.550
Right, is this OK--

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.050
yeah?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.725
So just for that case, what
do we think the probability--

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.902
how does that probably behave--

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:06.520
any ideas?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.820
So uranium has a half-life
or something, right?

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.080
You guys heard
this before, right?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.149
So let's just try to think
of how this should scale.

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.190
Whatever it is, it probably
should have something

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.320
to do with a time constant for
how fast uranium decays, yeah?

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.690
You guys are looking at
me, like, so blankly.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.255
This is not that hard.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.379
It's just one uranium atom.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.150
It's OK.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.270
All right, so let's just
write a plausible equation.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.780
Maybe it's dP dt, where
this is the probability

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.130
that the uranium is in the box.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.983
This might be the
probability divided by two.

00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:54.130
Something like that--
would that be--

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.440
all right, I guess we need
a negative sign maybe.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.890
So then the probability--
the solution to this

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.850
would be that the probability
that uranium is still there

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.106
is going to be equal to
some initial probability e

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:10.816
to the negative time over tau.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:12.229
Does that look right?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.899
Does this look very reasonable?

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.542
You might have seen
this before, yeah?

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.250
Maybe you didn't think
of it probability.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.890
Maybe you thought about it as
number of uraniums in the box.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.620
If I had written it as
the number of uraniums

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.890
is equal to the original
number of uraniums e

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.699
to the negative t
over tau, you guys

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.490
would have believed
that right away, right?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.470
OK, so I guess maybe this is
highlighting a issue here,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.810
is that we use a
macroscopic thinking.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.099
We're used to thinking of
things as continuum, right?

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.390
But if I only have one uranium
there, it's either there

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.290
or it's not there.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.010
It's 1 or 0.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.740
So the problem with
this equation--

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.660
if you compute this, it
computes irrational numbers,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.087
fractional numbers as
the number of uraniums.

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:06.670
But of course, the
number of uraniums,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.336
it's just either--
it's integers, right?

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:11.320
There's one uranium atom, or
there's two, or there's three.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.290
So this equation is
not right, right?

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.394
So this is incorrect.

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:17.560
So that was what you learned
in high school, right--

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.890
that equation?

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.410
But that's not right.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.800
So this is really the correct
equation, that the probability,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.350
that you have some number of
uraniums that does something.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.410
You know-- well this works
for one atom, anyway.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.120
So that's the equation for one.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.852
So this is probability
I have one uranium.

00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:38.560
It's the initial
probability that there's

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.310
one uranium in a box,
which is basically--

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.365
my case would be one.

00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:42.580
I know I put one in there.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.720
And then it just decays.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.862
The probability decays.

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:50.320
But it doesn't mean
uranium decays.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.095
So it means when I do-- if
I do the experiment once,

00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:58.940
and here I have the uranium--

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.620
the probability of the uranium
is a simple exponential decay--

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.420
time.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.830
I know I had a
uranium atom there

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.360
when I first put it there.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.826
And at later times
it's gone away,

00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:11.492
right? 'Cause at
longer and longer times

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:13.370
it's more and more likely
it would have fissioned.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.870
They

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.640
Now if I actually do this.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.590
And make a-- buy
a million boxes.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.265
And put a million
uranium atoms-- one

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.549
in each one to start with.

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:23.090
And then I just keep
coming back once

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.320
in a while and
checking, what I'll see,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.520
is that initially I had--

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.490
here's the number of uraniums.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.550
Initially I had a
million uranium atoms.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.419
And for some time period
I still had a million.

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.210
And then something
happened and one of them

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.360
went away, because one of the
fissioned, turned into lead--

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.570
or whatever they turn into.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.240
All right, and so now I had
a million minus one uraniums.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.690
They live for a while.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.380
And then maybe
another one went away.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.100
And then this time,
another went away.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.830
And that time it lasted longer--

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.610
right?

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.080
This is what you really
expect to observe.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.350
Is this OK?

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:13.536
And so this is sampling from
the probability distribution

00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:14.400
that you would use.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.500
Does that make sense?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.620
So I'm sampling a million times,
so I have a million boxes.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.550
This is the probability
distribution for one box.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.550
And so I'm able to
figure this out.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.300
Is this OK?

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.050
All right, so we'd like to
write equations like this

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.187
for more complicated systems.

00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:39.270
But you'll still going to
have the same confusion,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.869
that the probability is going
to be continuous variable.

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:43.410
And it's going to
behave in ways that

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.300
seem perfectly sensible to you.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.479
But then every time
you do the experiment,

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.020
different things
will happen in time.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.660
Because you have something at
the time-varying probability,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.700
and each time you sample from
the probability distribution--

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.074
every time you do
the experiment,

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.780
it's like a particular
instance of sampling

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.250
from that probability
distribution.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.705
And you might get that there
is 87 uranium atoms left.

00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:06.470
And you might get
that there's 93.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.030
And it's not because of
your measurement error.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.320
It's because the intrinsic
system has its own randomness

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.304
to it, right?

00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:15.970
You know, you look
at one uranium atom--

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.020
some uranium atoms live
for a million years.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.130
And some uranium atoms might
decay in the next second,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:21.630
right?

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.780
And you have no idea when
they're going to decay.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.560
All you know is statistically,
on the average, uraniums decay

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.410
with a certain half-life,
which is pretty long, right?

00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:35.150
All right, is this
totally obvious?

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.066
I can't figure it out.

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:38.559
Is this, like, totally
obvious, or totally confusing?

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.809
It's very funny-- with your
eyes and your expressions,

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.517
totally obvious and
totally confusing has

00:08:42.517 --> 00:08:43.660
the same blank expression.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.290
Can someone ask a question.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.130
Maybe that would
help us to have a--

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.967
this is OK?

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.050
All right, this is the OK.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.400
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.100
WILLIAM GREEN: This is OK.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.600
All right, so it's
totally obvious--

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.700
good, hard to tell sometimes.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.080
All right, so Joe Scott wrote
some brilliant notes trying

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.122
to explain how do this
for chemical kinetics, OK?

00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:06.579
So you should
definitely read them.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.810
They're in the-- posted
under the materials,

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.530
general section--

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.610
Stochastic Chemical Kinetics--
nice 20 page long thing,

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.810
something like that.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.690
It's definitely
worthwhile to read it.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.670
He was very nice at
writing very clear notes.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.180
So I'll try to explain
his notes inexpertly,

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.440
in a short period of time.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.160
I strongly recommend
you read them.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.140
So the idea is that the
chemical kinetic equations

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.390
you guys have all used
are also incorrect,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.950
right-- just like
this is incorrect.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.260
Because this is assuming
that something that's

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.470
really a discrete variable
is a continuous variable.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.450
And we do this all
the time, right?

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.470
We know that material
is made of atoms.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.110
And so when you measure our
mass in a certain volume,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.180
there only can be
certain discrete values.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.470
But we always ignore that.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.020
And we always treat is a
continuous variable, right?

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.070
So you have some flow--

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.665
some amount of liquid--

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:05.040
and you have some
amount of mass.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.570
And it could be any number.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.935
And we treat dm dt, or
things like dm dx, d rho dx--

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:13.560
we write those down
as if everything is

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.400
perfectly continuous variables.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.000
And that's because that in
a lot of systems we have,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.880
we have so many atoms--

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.830
and we can't measure
that well anyway--

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.680
that we couldn't tell if we
were missing one or two atoms.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.890
Whether we end up with an extra
half an atom in our equations

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.421
or not makes no difference,
because we're not that precise,

00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:31.920
right?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.045
So we don't worry about it.

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:35.720
So we use contiuum
equations everywhere and--

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.930
but in many cases, what
we really should be using

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.490
are continuous equations
for probabilities.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.070
And then as going to show you
how you do it for chemical

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.380
kinetics in a minute.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.460
I'd say that this is super
fundamental, actually.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.850
So quantum mechanics
says that everything

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.370
is wave functions,
which is actually

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.260
like the square root of
a probability density.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.150
And the real equations are
really probability densities.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.940
And so that's the real
fundamental equations.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.441
Really, everything
is probabilities.

00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:08.065
And when you make an
experiment, you're

00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:09.530
just sampling from
the probability.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.800
And all our continuum equations
are like approximations.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:19.150
They're only valid in, like,
the large number of atoms limit,

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.720
OK?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.055
I know this takes maybe
a change of thought,

00:11:24.055 --> 00:11:26.180
because you're so used to
those continuum equations

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.370
you start to believe
they're really true, right?

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.010
You've probably used them a lot.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.176
And you start to feel like
you love those equations.

00:11:33.176 --> 00:11:34.550
They're your favorite equations.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.170
You know, you have a
relationship with them.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.880
Some of them you might
hate, some you love.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.130
But at least, you have a
strong connection with them.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.660
And you just find out
that actually they're

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.090
not even related to
the real equations.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.256
The real equations are
actually something different.

00:11:45.256 --> 00:11:47.924
This can be very
annoying, but it's true.

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:50.090
And when you get to smaller
and smaller systems that

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.801
have fewer and fewer
molecules in them,

00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:54.800
then you get more and
more sensitive to the fact

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.240
that the regular
equations are incorrect.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.880
And this comes up a
lot in small systems.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.810
So many of you probably
will do research

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.560
that has to do with biology.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.040
In biology there's cells.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.830
Inside cells there's
subcellular structures.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.720
Inside those
subcellular structures,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.950
there's not very many molecules.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.660
And so you often are at the
limit where you have, like,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.780
one molecule of a certain
type inside this mitochondria,

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.940
or something.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.390
And that's it.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.440
And so you wouldn't expect the
continuum equations to work.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.330
And in fact there's
a big field--

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.130
many people at
research do in here--

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.230
called single
molecule spectroscopy,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.040
where you can measure the
motion of one DNA molecule

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.115
or something like that.

00:12:37.115 --> 00:12:41.870
And so you really see
the individual molecules,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.610
and the effects of the
individuality of the molecules.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.995
And this is not only
true in biology.

00:12:51.356 --> 00:12:52.730
For a long time--
there's a field

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.040
called emulsion polymerization.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.380
You guys ever hear of this?

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.838
So like, all the
paint on the walls

00:12:57.838 --> 00:13:00.259
here is made by that
process, where they

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:01.550
polymerize methyl methacrylate.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.070
They want to make the
little beads of polymers

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.900
all have a small
dispersion as possible,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.160
to make all the
molecules the same.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.430
So what they do is they make
a colloidal suspension--

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.050
I'm going to draw
a little picture.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.890
So they have the reactor.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.570
They make little bubbles
of the monomer that

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.920
are suspended in some solid.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.840
And inside each
of these bubbles--

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.465
because the way they
make them, they're

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:27.504
all about the same size.

00:13:27.504 --> 00:13:28.920
So they all have
a lot of bubbles,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.000
all about the same size.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.565
And then they polymerize.

00:13:31.565 --> 00:13:32.940
And they polymerize
each of them.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.870
And they polymerize.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.703
And basically, all the
material that's there

00:13:35.703 --> 00:13:38.100
polymerizes into one molecule.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.440
Now how do they
make that happen--

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.800
is that they introduce,
say, a free radical.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.160
And one free radical gets
into one of these bubbles.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.960
And it can polymerize
the whole thing,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.700
because the reactions
are a radical plus

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.840
monomer goes to a polymer--

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.860
bigger polymer, right?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.610
So polymer radical
size n goes to polymer

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.400
radical size n plus 1.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.020
That's the
polymerization reaction.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.910
Now normally, if you
did this in the bulk,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.110
there would be a
lot of radicals.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:16.420
And some of these guys
would react with each other.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.930
And the radical will be gone,
because the two radicals would

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.720
react, make a new chemical bond,
and this process would stop.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.110
And so this gives a big
dispersion in the size

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.950
of the polymer chains you get.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.550
So to beat this, they do
emulsion polymerization.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.890
And they make that number
of radicals so small

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.740
that statistically, at any
time, any of these droplets

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.930
either has zero or
one of radicals in it.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.470
And there's not--
during the time

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.690
it does the polymerization,
there's not enough time

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.114
for a second radical to come in.

00:14:49.114 --> 00:14:51.155
So it's only got one
radical, so that one radical

00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:52.779
is going to eat up
every single monomer

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:54.524
molecule in the whole thing.

00:14:54.524 --> 00:14:56.440
And so it's going take
a giant polymer, that's

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.370
a whole size of the emulsion.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.642
If you made the drops too big,
you get two radicals in there.

00:15:02.642 --> 00:15:04.100
And you get some
of this happening.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.760
And then you get a dispersion.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.670
So this is emulsion
polymerization.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.320
All right, so cells have
small little volumes.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.110
Colloids and emulsions
have small little volumes.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.790
They all have-- that the--

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.697
some of the molecules-- the
important molecules are so--

00:15:26.697 --> 00:15:29.030
have such low concentrations--
the volumes are so small,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.850
that the concentration times
the volume is less than 1,

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.290
or about 1.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.370
So that's for like-- you know,
your copies of DNA in you,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.550
in your cells.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.800
It's the same kind of thing
for radicals-- free radicals

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.570
in a polymerization system.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.194
And similar things could
happen with, like, explosions--

00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:48.860
different kinds of
rare events, that you

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.734
might have a very small
number of some really

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:52.010
important molecule.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.900
And then whether or
not you have one or not

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.390
is really important, OK.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.490
All right, so we want to
model those kinds of systems,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.370
we have to worry
about the graininess.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.665
So we want to write down
what the equation is dP dt.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.050
So first you've got to
think, well what is P?

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:19.625
Let's do a case where I have
the reaction of A plus B

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:21.717
goes to C, OK?

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:23.300
Suppose this is the
only reaction that

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.500
can happen in our system.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.333
The only molecules we
have in our system are

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:27.640
A's, B's, and C's.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.630
And so our probability
distribution--

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.130
our probability
that we want to know

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.170
is how many A's, how
many B's, how many C's do

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.664
we have in our system, OK?

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.940
So that's the probability
we're interested to know.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.210
We could have 5 A's,
2 B's, and 0 C's.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.720
We could have 3 A's, 7 B's,
11 C's-- who knows, right--

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.020
different numbers like that.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.396
If it gets out to be 10 to
the 23, then there's no point.

00:16:53.396 --> 00:16:55.353
You don't have to do
this, because you can just

00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:57.420
go back your continuum
equations, right?

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.450
But if you have 5, or
3, or 2, or 1, or 0,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.390
then you really need to
worry about the graininess.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.190
So you want to write
down an equation.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:13.819
So here's a probability
of n A n B n C.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:20.214
And it's going to equal to
reactions which consume--

00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:22.130
if I'm in this state
that has a certain number

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.670
A's, B's, and C's,
and I can react away,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.440
so I only have reactions--

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.090
for example, I'm in this state.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.020
An d plus B could
react with each other,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.620
and will react away.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.316
So I'll have some reaction.

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:36.690
I'm going to write
a k, but we'll

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.780
come back to what this really
means exactly in a minute.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:46.040
So this is the k for
A plus B going to C.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.840
And we think that
this is going to scale

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.370
with the number of A's and the
number of B's I've got, right?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:18:01.670
And this depends on the
probability that I have A B C.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:08.310
So if I'm in this state
with n A's n B's n C's--

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.970
that probability is
going to go down,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.330
because the A's and B's can
react with each other, right?

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.900
Now on the other hand,
I have plus the same k.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.460
And this is going to
be n A prime n B prime.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.630
If I have some other state
that can react so that it makes

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.730
this state, then
I'll get a plus sign,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.990
because probability of
this state would increase.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:52.700
So for example, if n A prime
is equal to n A plus 1.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.450
And n B prime is
equal to n B plus 1

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.720
and n C prime is
equal to n C minus 1,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.370
then that state can react
by one of these A's and one

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.220
of these B's combining together
to make a C. That will get me

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.850
to this exact state here.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.710
Does this make sense?

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.294
All Right, so that's
the master equation

00:19:19.294 --> 00:19:20.710
if I have a system
that could only

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.860
do the irreversible reaction A
plus B goes to C. So the only--

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.120
I can go away-- because
the probability density

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.520
of this-- the probability
that this state can reduce,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.310
because that reaction occurs
starting from this state.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.620
And probability this
state can increase,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.680
because I started from
this other state here--

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.040
this special state here.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.230
And that would make
the state interest.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.020
All right and so I have
equation-- this equation

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.750
over and over again, for every
possible value of n A, n B,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.140
n C. Is this OK?

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.200
Now I have to actually--

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.000
remember for chemical
kinetics, that whenever

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.990
you have a forward reaction, you
also have the reverse reaction.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.800
So there's actually
a couple more terms.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.010
So now I have another loss term.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.180
This is C goes to A plus B. This
is going to tell of the number

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.920
of C's.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:20.100
And that's P of n
A n B n C. And then

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.470
I have another source term.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.130
And this is where I start
from the state with one more

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:50.360
C. Is that OK?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.370
So this set of equations is
called the kinetic master

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.410
equation.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.750
And this is the equation that
describes the real system.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.490
So this is the real probability
of finding the system with any

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.350
number of A's, B's, and C's.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.560
And I have an equation like this
for every different possible

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.630
number of A's, number
of B's, number of C's.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.360
All right?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.350
And it's not bad as
an equation goes.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.840
It's a linear
differential equation,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.090
because it's linear
in P's, right?

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.140
There's just first--
everything's first power in P.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:38.950
So in general, I can rewrite
this as dP dt is the some

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:45.730
matrix times B. And the matrix
entries are these prefactors--

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.910
things like this and this--

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.550
sorry, this, this.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.750
These are the different
elements in the matrix, m.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:06.790
So you should go ahead
and be able to write

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.900
any kinetic equation system--
rewrite it in this form

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.040
if you want.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.740
It's called the kinetic
master equation.

00:22:23.751 --> 00:22:25.560
Now if I do an
experiment like I talked

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.980
about with uranium, where I
put one uranium atom in there.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.700
And all uranium
atoms can react to do

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.650
is fall apart to
lead plus neutrons,

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.382
or whatever the heck
they fall apart to.

00:22:34.382 --> 00:22:36.340
So I can write down--
there's like one reaction

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.470
that uranium nuclei do.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.630
And so I can write it out.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.880
It will just be
something like this.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.714
And this equation
will work for a case

00:22:43.714 --> 00:22:45.880
where I put one uranium
atom in there to begin with.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.296
I could do the case where I
put two uranium atoms in there

00:22:48.296 --> 00:22:49.360
to begin with.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.605
I could write this down.

00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:52.720
Is that all right?

00:22:52.720 --> 00:23:02.230
OK, now if I had a case where I
had 27 A's, 14 B's, and 33 C's

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.230
to start with, then you
can see that the number

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.490
of possibilities here
might get pretty large.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.140
'Cause I have to consider,
well, I could lose one A,

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.540
and lose one B,
and get one more C.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.330
But then I'll have an
equation for this term which

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.510
will look just like this.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.880
But it'll go to ones where
I have lost two A's and two

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.485
B's and gained two C's.

00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:24.110
And then all the way down, until
you get down to one of the n's

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.630
to be zero.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.990
And so it could be quite a lot
of possible equations, right?

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.610
So the dimension-- the
length of the vector P

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.250
might get really long, right?

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:52.110
So the length of P is something
like the max number of A's, max

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.060
number of B's,
max number of C's.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.100
All right, so if I have--

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.010
I'll allow-- consider systems
with up to 10 A's, 10 B's, 10

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.140
C's--

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.660
then this is 1,000--

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.492
P's a length of
approximately 1,000.

00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:13.700
And it might be less than
that, because maybe there's

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.160
some of them-- some particular
states I can't get to.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.796
So maybe it's less than 1,000,
but something like 1,000.

00:24:19.796 --> 00:24:21.670
On the other hand, if
I allow it to a million

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.390
A's, a million B's, and
millions C's, then I,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.950
like, 10 to the 18 length of P.
So P gets pretty long, pretty

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.990
fast when the number of
possible states goes up.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.990
Is that all right?

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.780
So-- now, it's linear though.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.450
And it's linear.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.866
And this is constant
coefficients.

00:24:42.866 --> 00:24:45.030
And so this is really
not-- and sparse.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.460
So this is really--
it's not that bad.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.100
And in fact Professor
Barton's group

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.690
has worked on these
kind of problems.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.450
And he has to solves that can
work with P has dimension up

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.410
to 200 million.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.960
So if you can keep the number--
say it's 200 million or less,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.360
you can actually
solve this exactly.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.400
Now solving this
exactly is really good,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.010
because then you actually
have the exact probability

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.620
of any observable measurement
that you would possibly make

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.390
at any time, all computed, OK?

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.010
So that's really great.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.136
But as I just pointed out,
if I make these numbers,

00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:19.176
like, 10 to the 6, 10 to
the 6, and 10 to the 6--

00:25:19.176 --> 00:25:20.380
this is like 10 of the 18.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.130
That's a lot bigger
than 200 million.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.600
And so Professor Barton's
numerical methods

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.310
are going to poop
out at some point,

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.260
and not going to
work for you anymore.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.770
So there's a limited number
of problems you can do.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.010
So if your problem small enough,
you can just solve this--

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:43.620
for really small ones you can
solve this with OD45 or OD15s

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.844
But because it's linear, there's
special solution methods.

00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:49.260
I don't know if you remember
solutions of linear equations

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.110
this, you can relate
them to the eigenvectors

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.060
and eigenvalues of m.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.484
And so you can do--
that's one way to do it.

00:25:56.484 --> 00:25:58.400
And then there are special
methods you can do.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.441
Talk to Professor Barton.

00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:02.421
If it's sparse-- and it has
certain kinds properties,

00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:04.920
you can make this really-- you
can make quite large systems,

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.820
up to 10 to the 8 kind of size.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.470
If we get a system with more
than 10 to 8 possible states,

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.470
that means more than 10
to the 8 possible things

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.770
could be observed or
the result of experiment

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.169
could have more than
10 to 8 possibilities,

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:20.710
then this is-- you're
not going to be

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.970
able to solve it this way.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.553
And so then we're
going to have to use

00:26:23.553 --> 00:26:26.390
a stochastic solid solution
method to try to figure--

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:31.290
to do-- so we're going to
try a sample from P of t.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.910
So I guess I should comment,
again, I wrote it this way.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:34.729
But the thing--

00:26:34.729 --> 00:26:36.270
P is definitely--
it depends on time.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.228
So it's you'll have
different P for every time.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.315
Yeah?

00:26:43.315 --> 00:26:58.167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:58.167 --> 00:27:00.250
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah maybe
I'll just do better to--

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.250
I can substitute it in here.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.750
Is that all right?

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.958
AUDIENCE: So, like, if you
transfer all the neighbors

00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:22.750
in it, that's--?

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:27.220
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah,
'cause a key idea

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:34.720
is that chemical kinetics
only does one step at a time.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.954
So if you have a reaction
like this, at any instant

00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:43.370
the probability
that two reactions

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.453
are going to be happening
exactly the same instant

00:27:45.453 --> 00:27:46.770
is negligible.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.150
So at any instant you're
only changing the numbers

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.820
of the atoms by one unit, yeah.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.664
AUDIENCE: Then shouldn't
you add another A minus 1

00:27:55.664 --> 00:27:56.612
and an E minus 1?

00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:01.480
WILLIAM GREEN: Maybe
I got this backwards.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.680
n A plus 1 plus 1 minus 1,
minus 1 minus 1 plus 1--

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.330
I think got-- I
think this is right.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.600
So this is for the forward
reaction that always reduces

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.827
the number of A's and B's.

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:18.326
And this is the reverse reaction
that always increases them.

00:28:18.326 --> 00:28:20.117
And so I think you
generally get like this.

00:28:20.117 --> 00:28:21.680
You always get--
for any reaction,

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.190
you'll have four terms--

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.650
so the forward and
reverse, starting

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.385
from initial state, and
the forward and reverse

00:28:29.385 --> 00:28:30.260
that make your state.

00:28:32.762 --> 00:28:34.220
And then if you
add more reactions,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.540
you have a system where you've
got a lot more reactions.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.150
Maybe you have C's
that can just decompose

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.580
into B's or something--
different reactions.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.150
Then you'd have a sum
like this with terms

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.950
like this from every reaction.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.283
And you'd go through all your
list of all your reaction.

00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:52.730
I guess there's one funny
thing I should point out

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.120
to you about this, which is
very important for this emulsion

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.030
polymerization case--

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:07.480
Is that if you have a reaction
of the type A plus A goes to--

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:14.900
I don't know-- B. That might
be a reaction you could have.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.350
That when I write down
the equation, if I only

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:23.170
have one A in my sample, this
probability of this happening

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.320
is 0, right?

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.390
Because I need two A's
for this to happen.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:35.030
So really, the equation for this
case is n A times n A minus 1.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:41.720
So it's k A plus A goes to B
times n A times n A minus 1.

00:29:44.724 --> 00:29:47.140
And this is crucial for, like,
the emulsion polymerization

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.440
case, 'cause the fact that I
don't have the second one is

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.444
really important.

00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:56.270
Otherwise I always
miscompute that this radical

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.811
could react with
itself and terminate

00:29:57.811 --> 00:29:58.906
itself, which is not true.

00:30:01.774 --> 00:30:03.100
Is that all right?

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.260
I commented that these
k's are a little bit odd.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.840
So if you remember, if you
have a k for a unimolecular

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.692
reaction, like C goes to A plus
B, what units would it have?

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.157
What are the units
for regular kinetics?

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:27.240
AUDIENCE: Inverse seconds.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.240
WILLIAM GREEN: Right,
inverse seconds, right?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.740
So you would normally
say this thing

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.347
has units of inverse seconds.

00:30:31.347 --> 00:30:32.680
And that works fine here, right?

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.760
Because I have dP dt, and
it's in for a seconds times P,

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.490
so it's fine.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.020
However, this guy-- to make
the units work out, still

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.452
has to also be inverse seconds,
but that's not normally

00:30:44.452 --> 00:30:46.410
what you would have for
a bimolecular reaction.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.020
And the other thing to watch
out for here is that I have n's.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.270
But normally you would write
them with concentrations,

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.080
right?

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.850
You have the-- you'd
would write something

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.490
like k times the
concentration of C. It's

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.060
the normal way you write your
equations, the right equations.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.450
But this is not the same, right?

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.460
This is n.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.010
This is unitless.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.580
Now it turns out, in
this case, actually, you

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.030
can use exactly the
same as k and it works.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.120
But for the bimolecular case,
it definitely does not work.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.950
The units are wrong.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.890
And also this
concentration thing

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.020
implies that we think
the rate really has--

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:32.770
suppose we have k A k B. I
could rewrite this as k times n

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.880
A over the volume,
n B over the volume.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.279
Is that all right?

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:42.320
Actually one thing I should
warn you about-- that

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.420
usually when I write this,
I write moles per liter.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.020
So I have factors of 10 to
the 23 between this and this,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.520
because these n's have got to
be the individual molecules

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.780
for this to work.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.210
So watch out.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.680
First of all, there's a 10
to the 23 somewhere in here,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.180
right--

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.550
Avogadro's number.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.739
And then this is what--

00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:03.030
how we would normally write it.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.360
But this k has the
wrong units for us here.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:17.218
And so this guy here is the
normal k divided by the volume.

00:32:22.008 --> 00:32:25.422
I think that's right.

00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:28.270
Maybe it's the other way around.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.489
No, this is normal
k times the volume.

00:32:31.489 --> 00:32:32.030
That's right.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:37.450
So normally we would
write units k normal--

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:47.430
normal kinetics, macro--
k for A plus B reactions,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:52.170
the units are centimeters
cubed per mole second.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.385
But we want them
to be units of--

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:08.227
the new k has got to
be units of per second.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:23.515
And so the new k is equal to the
old k new old times the volume.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.230
Is that right-- no
divided by the volume.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.760
I was right the first time.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.810
This is volume-- yeah.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:36.530
Thank you-- centimetres
cubed, centimeters cubed--

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.650
yeah, right.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.230
Cancelled out,
good for a second.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:46.458
So this is k per volume normal
k divided by n-- correct.

00:33:49.469 --> 00:33:51.260
And you may wonder,
well how come it's only

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.240
volume to the first power?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.880
Before I had volume
to the second power

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.930
in the denominator.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.480
And it's because I'm using
n's up in the numerator.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.590
And it's just like here.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.216
I'm using n's
instead of n over v.

00:34:05.216 --> 00:34:07.340
So I've sort of multiplied
through by v everywhere.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.190
That's one way to look at it.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:16.248
All right, no questions yet?

00:34:16.248 --> 00:34:17.240
Yeah?

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.728
AUDIENCE: So when
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:23.739
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah, so I
need a 10 to the 23 as well.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.180
So there's got to be
an Avogadro's number.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.679
And you'll have to help me where
the Avogadro's number goes.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.449
But it's got to be
in there somewhere,

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:34.597
to get from moles to molecules.

00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:36.055
So the numbers are
a lot different.

00:34:41.005 --> 00:34:44.280
Is this OK?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.499
And this factor, this
n minus 1 thing--

00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:48.540
again, when these are
macroscopic numbers like 10

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.331
to the 23, this makes
no difference, right?

00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:51.439
Because it's minus 1.

00:34:51.439 --> 00:34:53.775
So we can fit our
data ignoring the 1--

00:34:53.775 --> 00:34:55.400
It's 1.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.076
Perfectly well, the law of
mass action-- it works fine.

00:34:58.076 --> 00:34:59.700
So you never notice
this unless you get

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.080
down to where n is very small.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.840
But this is actually the truth.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.999
This is really what the
correct equation is.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.562
OK so now we have these--
the true equations

00:35:18.562 --> 00:35:20.520
for predicting how the
probability distribution

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.680
evolves in a reacting system.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.720
By the way, you can
add transport in

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.040
as well if you want.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.960
So you have control
volumes, and you

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.660
know formulas for the rate at
which stuff is transported in

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.220
and out of the control volume.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.870
You can add those
terms in as well.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.240
And they'll affect the
probability distribution.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.060
No problem, you should be able
to do the same conversion.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.381
So just-- we've converted
the reaction equations.

00:35:42.381 --> 00:35:43.630
You can write a similar thing.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.110
Once you get right the
macroscopic transport equation,

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.860
you can figure out how
you would reduce it

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.550
down to a time
constant for transport

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.660
that would work for the--

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.704
for this microscopic
version of the equations.

00:35:55.704 --> 00:35:58.120
So transport reaction-- you
can write the whole thing down

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:58.994
as a master equation.

00:35:58.994 --> 00:36:01.390
That's a real solution,
the real equation.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.300
And the problem is that the
real equation oftentimes

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.650
is too big, because P scales
up so rapidly with the number

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.562
of possible states.

00:36:10.562 --> 00:36:13.020
So then we have to figure out
how are we going to solve it.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.740
And the way to solve it is by--

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.240
called kinetic Monte Carlo.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:33.090
And this method was invented
by a guy named Joe Gillespie.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.755
And the journal paper is posted.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.140
And this is just like
with Monte Carlo--

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.420
Metropolis Monte Carlo
that you just did.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.930
We're trying to
find a way to sample

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.260
from the true
probability density

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.940
without ever computing the
true probability density.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.760
So in the Monte
Carlo integration

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.450
you're doing for
homework, you're

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.905
sampling from the true
Boltzmann probability density,

00:37:04.905 --> 00:37:06.530
but you never actually
supposedly write

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.665
down what that P is, right?

00:37:09.665 --> 00:37:11.540
And so we're going to
do the same thing here,

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.620
is we're going to--

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.147
from the differential
equations--

00:37:15.147 --> 00:37:16.730
from this differential
equation system

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.570
here, we're going to try to
somehow never ever solve this

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:24.144
directly, but instead just
sample from the solution, P,

00:37:24.144 --> 00:37:25.060
which depends on time.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:34.070
And the way it's
done is really to try

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.980
to follow individual
trajectories of what

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.130
could have happened, OK?

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.850
So at any time-step,
we have some number

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.510
of A's, B's and C's.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.600
And we're going to say,
well in the next time

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.700
period, some small time
period, what could happen?

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.700
And we're going to make
the time period so small

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.290
that the only thing that can
happen is nothing happens,

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.160
and A, B and C stay
the same, or one event

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.000
happens which will change one
of the numbers, the A's, B's,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.870
and C's, by the same
one reaction amount, OK?

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:14.330
And then after we accomplish
that, now we have a new state--

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.784
A, B, and C with
some new values.

00:38:15.784 --> 00:38:17.200
And we'll do the
same thing again.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.783
And we just repeat
that over and over.

00:38:18.783 --> 00:38:19.990
So it's very brute force.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:25.250
You're just doing, like, what
a single system would do.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.650
So for example, for
the uranium atom case,

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.690
we have one uranium
atom in there.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.120
We wait for some time
period, say 20 minutes.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.370
We compute the probability
that the uranium would have

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.130
decayed in the last 20 minutes.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.400
It's pretty small.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.490
And then we'll say, OK, now
we'll draw a random number.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:47.840
If the random number is
less than that probability,

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.195
then we think that the
uranium is still there.

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:53.570
And if the random number is
bigger than that probability,

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.710
then the uranium is gone.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.370
If it's still there,
then we'll do it again.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.690
And we'll just keep doing
that over and over again.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.470
And we'll sample
what could happen.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.650
The uranium atom could live
for 38 years and 14 minutes,

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.141
and then disappear.

00:39:09.141 --> 00:39:10.390
And that would be one example.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.973
And then we go back
and we do it again

00:39:11.973 --> 00:39:13.590
from a different trajectory.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.420
And we do it over and
over and over again.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.250
And we do it over
and over again.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.130
Those trajectories are sampling
from what could happen,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.935
with the right
probability density.

00:39:21.935 --> 00:39:23.924
Does this make sense?

00:39:23.924 --> 00:39:25.340
So the way Gillespie
says to do it

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:44.012
is figure out the expected time
until something would happen.

00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:48.720
We'll call this time tau.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:40:02.404
And we'll pull-- actually
let's not use tau,

00:40:02.404 --> 00:40:03.820
because that's the
only one that--

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.830
I'll try to be consistent
with Joe's notation.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.510
He calls this thing 1/a.

00:40:20.925 --> 00:40:25.650
So a is like the
expected rate per second.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.870
And 1/a is the expected time
until something would happen.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:42.450
And then we'll draw
a random number r--

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.220
he calls it r1.

00:40:46.867 --> 00:40:48.580
So we just call
the rand function.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.480
It gives me a number
between 0 and 1.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.430
And I'll say that my
time-step, delta t--

00:40:55.430 --> 00:41:02.100
which Joe calls tau, is
1/a the logarithm of 1/o.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:13.838
So I think there should
be a negative sign.

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:15.290
No, 1/r is positive.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.030
That's right-- positive.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:21.490
All right, so I choose
a random number.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.790
Suppose it's 1/2.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.475
Then this fraction is 2--

00:41:25.475 --> 00:41:27.080
1 over 1/2 is 2.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.780
Logarithm of 2 is some
number bigger than 1.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.070
And I pull that.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:31.835
And I get some--

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.940
actually, some number less
than 1-- logarithm of 2--

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.530
anyway, some positive number.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.040
Multiply it by the expected
time until something happens--

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.410
and that's the time, in
this particular simulation,

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.725
when the next thing happened.

00:41:46.725 --> 00:41:48.850
And then I repeat this
again, and again, and again.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.640
And I get the period of
time intervals between when

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.607
something happened.

00:41:52.607 --> 00:41:54.940
Now every time something
happened, I have to figure out,

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.930
well, what happened?

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.626
So if I look at my--

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:07.360
plot back here when I had the
uranium, I waited a long--

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:13.140
in this particular
case, here's my tau.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.595
I'll call this tau 1--

00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:18.232
the time that it took for
the first thing to happen.

00:42:18.232 --> 00:42:19.690
And then, well--
what could happen?

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.580
The only thing can happen with
my single uranium atom case

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.520
is it decayed.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.430
So it went away.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:30.250
All right, and then I do
the random thing again.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:30.790
And I draw.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.415
And I get a different
number this time.

00:42:34.234 --> 00:42:35.900
How long it is 'till
something happened.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.090
Now notice-- maybe
it's not so obvious--

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:46.535
that in the time until something
happens changes as you run.

00:42:46.535 --> 00:42:50.840
So for example, if I started
out with 100 uranium atoms

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.070
in 100 little boxes.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.480
And I'm watching them.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.430
After I've run this
for a long time,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.651
I only have 50
uranium atoms left.

00:42:57.651 --> 00:42:59.150
And that means that
the average time

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.482
period until something
happens will be slower,

00:43:01.482 --> 00:43:02.690
because I don't have as many.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.060
The more I have, the more
rapidly something will happen.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.660
Does that make sense?

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.450
So I have to compute this
a thing at each iteration.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.976
So I compute the time
until something happens.

00:43:14.976 --> 00:43:16.950
Then I'm going to
compute what happened.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.060
I'll tell you what
that the second.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.185
In the uranium case, the
only thing that can happen

00:43:20.185 --> 00:43:22.310
is one of the uranium
atoms decayed.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.780
So I took that away.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.520
Now I have to compute a again.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:32.170
So a is the sum of all the
things that can happen.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.980
So in my case where I
have 100 uranium atoms,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.420
I have 100 different boxes.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.690
In each one of them, there is
a rate at which uranium atom

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.870
probability is decaying.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.480
It's like 1 over the normal
half life uranium-- or something

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.690
like that.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.310
And I add them up.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:44:01.190
So a is the sum of the rates
of everything that can happen.

00:44:10.017 --> 00:44:11.850
So we just list out all
the different things

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:13.240
that can happen.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.330
So in the case-- suppose
I have two boxes--

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.160
two uranium atoms.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.220
I can have decay of uranium
atom number one or uranium atom

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.630
number two.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:25.394
So I have-- this thing
would be equal to--

00:44:25.394 --> 00:44:26.600
so two uranium atoms--

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:40.914
a is equal to 1 over tau normal
for a uranium atom plus one

00:44:40.914 --> 00:44:41.580
over tau normal.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.700
Because they're both
normal uranium atoms.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.040
So it's equal to 2/tau.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.620
And so 1/a is half of
the normal lifetime.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.430
And that's when I would
expect that something

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.570
would happen by then, OK?

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.550
One of them would
probably decay.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:05.050
So that would be the a
value I would use here.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.230
Draw my random
number, get my tau

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.480
until something
probably happened,

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.400
then figure out what happens.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.830
Now in the kinetics case,
several different things

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.580
can happen, right?

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:23.275
I wrote down if I'm in
state n A n B n C, I--

00:45:23.275 --> 00:45:26.850
the state can change
by two different ways.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:33.330
I can move out of that
state this way or this way.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.830
Two different
reactions can happen--

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.470
a forward or reverse reaction.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.370
And they would both take
me out of the state.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.453
So those are two different
things that can happen.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.680
And so I have to
add those rates.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:54.510
So I would add this
number and this number.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.970
And they would be the two
things that could happen.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.740
And that would give
me the a value.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.690
Now I figured out
something happened.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.940
But now I'm not doing uranium.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.649
Now doing, say, number of A's.

00:46:07.649 --> 00:46:09.190
Now I figured out
something happened.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.981
But now I have to figure
out what happened.

00:46:10.981 --> 00:46:14.080
And the number of A's could
have gone up or gone down,

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.730
because if it was
a forward reaction,

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.997
the number of A's went down.

00:46:16.997 --> 00:46:19.330
If it was a reverse reaction,
the number of A's went up.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.540
So I have to decide which
way is going to happen.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.780
So I could have either the
number of A's went down,

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.850
or the number of A's went up.

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:29.150
Those are two possibilities.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.820
I have to figure out
which one happened.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.590
I have to figure--

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.670
draw another random
number to figure out

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.870
which one probably happened.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.590
So I'll list out the list
of all the things that

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.210
can happen with their rates.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.350
And one of them, say, is
twice as big as the other.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:49.000
So that'll be twice
as likely to happen.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.880
So I have to choose
a random number,

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.220
and use that to
choose the next one.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:00.722
So first I figured out--

00:47:00.722 --> 00:47:02.180
this is actually
what we did first.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.700
I figured out what my rates are.

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.922
Second thing is I figure out the
time until something happened.

00:47:07.922 --> 00:47:10.130
Third thing is I'm going to
figure out what happened.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.240
And what I do is I say--

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.290
I draw a random
number called r2.

00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:26.620
And if there's only
two possibilities

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.280
like in this case,
then I can say

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:43.690
if r2 is less than the
rate of process one divided

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:49.200
by the sum of the rates, which
is the same as the a, right?

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.810
So this is-- it this is true,
then process one happened.

00:47:57.769 --> 00:48:00.310
On the other hand, if the rate--
if the random number I chose

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:05.206
is larger than this ratio, then
I'll say process two happened.

00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:07.830
And that's how I decide whether
a number of A's went up or went

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:09.717
down.

00:48:09.717 --> 00:48:12.300
And then I would recompute the
a-- depending on what happened.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.490
Suppose I do this.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.294
And I found out that the
number of A's went up--

00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:19.100
because I-- by drawing
the random number.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.905
Then I'll go and I'll
recompute the A. Now

00:48:21.905 --> 00:48:24.430
the rates will all be different,
because n A is bigger.

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.050
So the rate of the n
A reaction is faster.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.320
So I recompute it.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.170
I redraw a number here, and
get some different time, tau 2.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.290
It's not the same as tau 1.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.790
And then something
happened here.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.012
I do the same process
here out what happened.

00:48:39.012 --> 00:48:41.220
Maybe this time A reacted
away and it went back down.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.810
And then I do it again.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.190
And this time I draw
a longer time, tau 3.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:51.510
And I do-- what happened?

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.635
And maybe this time, again,
something reacted away.

00:48:53.635 --> 00:48:55.100
And it went down.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.320
And on, and on, and on--

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.710
and after my computer is
done doing that for a while,

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.739
like, after a long enough
time, I say, OK, I'm done.

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:03.780
Oh-- I'm not really done.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.321
I have to go back
and start it again,

00:49:05.321 --> 00:49:08.540
and run another
simulation to run

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.210
through all the possibilities.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.230
And I want to save all
these results of all

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.150
these simulations,
because these guys are

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.077
samples from the
probability distribution.

00:49:17.077 --> 00:49:19.160
And if I built histograms
of stuff from those guys

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.336
I can figure out what
really is going to happen.

00:49:21.336 --> 00:49:26.188
All right, so it's a way to
represent the P. Questions?

00:49:29.954 --> 00:49:31.120
All right-- perfectly clear?

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:38.540
All right, so what's nice
about this is actually,

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.032
it's not that hard
once you do this once.

00:49:41.032 --> 00:49:41.990
It's not hard to do it.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.280
And you can do it for
any problem at all.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.700
And so it's like--

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.990
often cases people do
this even for cases

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:51.260
where you actually could solve--

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.267
you might be able to
solve this equation.

00:49:53.267 --> 00:49:54.600
A lot times, people won't do it.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.882
They'll do this instead
just because it's so easy.

00:49:57.882 --> 00:49:59.840
So though maybe it looks
hard to you right now,

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.990
it's only a three step thing.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:02.330
And just do it over,
and over again.

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:02.870
You're not doing it.

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.130
The computer's doing it--

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.580
no big deal.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.164
And so this one
you have to, like,

00:50:07.164 --> 00:50:08.830
look at the sparsity
pattern of your m--

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.390
and some complicated stuff.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:16.210
So this is actually
done extremely commonly.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.260
All right, see you on Friday.

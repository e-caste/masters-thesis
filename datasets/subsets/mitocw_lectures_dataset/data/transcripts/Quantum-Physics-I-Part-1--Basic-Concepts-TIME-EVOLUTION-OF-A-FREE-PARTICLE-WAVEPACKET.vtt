00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:13.360
PROFESSOR: Time evolution of
a free particle wave packet.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.930
So, suppose you
know psi of x and 0.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.300
Suppose you know psi of x and 0.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.520
So what do you do
next, if you want

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.320
to calculate psi of x and t?

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:57.660
Well, the first step, step
one, is calculate phi of k.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.870
So you have phi of k is equal
1 over square root of 2 pi

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.240
integral dx psi of x,
0 e to the minus ikx.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.000
So you must do this integral.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.440
Step two-- step two--

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:39.910
with this, now rewrite
and say that psi of x, 0

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.380
is 1 over square root
of 2 pi dk e to the--

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.210
no, I'm sorry-- phi
of k, e to the ikx.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.840
So that has achieved our
rewriting of psi of x and 0,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.970
which was an arbitrary function
as a superposition of plane

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.470
waves.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.266
Step three is the
most fun step of all.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:22.500
Step three-- you look at
this, and then you say,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.200
well, I know now what
psi of x and t is.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
Evolving this is as
easy as doing nothing.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.110
What I must do here is 1
over square root of 2 pi--

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.570
just copy this-- dk,
phi of k, e to the ikx.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.510
And I put here
minus omega of k, t.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.840
And I remind you that h bar
omega of k is the energy,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.160
and it's equal to h
squared k squared over 2m.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.340
This is our free particle.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.410
And I claim that,
just by writing this,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.900
I've solved the
Schrodinger equation

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.670
and I've time-evolved
everything.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.840
The answer is there--

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.100
I didn't have to solve the
differential equation, or--

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.330
that's it.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.760
That's the answer.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.400
Claim this is the answer.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.380
And the reason is important.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.340
If you come equipped with a
Schrodinger equation, what

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:58.580
should you check, that ih bar
d psi dt is equal to h psi--

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.360
which is minus h-- squared over
2m, d second, dx squared psi.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.100
Well, you can add with
ih d dt on this thing.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.590
And you remember
all that happens

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.740
is that they all
concentrate on this thing.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.339
And it solves this,
because it's a plane wave.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.350
So this thing, this
psi of x and t,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.300
solves the Schrodinger equation.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.260
It's a superposition of
plane waves, each of which

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.960
solves the free
Schrodinger equation.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.090
So, we also mention that since
the Schrodinger equation is

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.110
first ordered in time, if you
know the wave function at one

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.350
time, and you solve it, you get
the wave function at any time.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.580
So here is a solution that is
a solution of the Schrodinger

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.640
equation.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.040
But at time equals 0--

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.400
this is 0-- and we reduce
this to psi of x and 0.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.130
So it has the right condition.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.520
Not only solve the
Schrodinger equation,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.010
but it reduces to
the right thing.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.580
So it is the answer.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.660
And we could say--

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.330
we could say that there
is a step four, which is--

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.390
step four would be
do the k integral.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.990
And sometimes it's possible.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.710
You see, in here, once
you have this phi of k,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.350
maybe you can just
look at it and say, oh,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.630
yeah, I can do this k integral
and get psi of x and 0,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.150
recover what I know.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.470
I know how to do-- this
integral is a little harder,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.070
because k appears a
little more complicated.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.230
But it has the whole
answer to the problem.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.000
I think one should
definitely focus on this

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.320
and appreciate that, with zero
effort and Fourier's theorem,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.050
you're managing to solve the
propagation of any initial wave

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.400
function for all times.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.330
So there will be an exercise in
the homework, which is called

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:58.900
evolving the free Gaussian--

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.080
Gaussian.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.400
So you take a psi
a of x and time

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.970
equals 0 to be e to the
minus x squared over 4a

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.010
squared over 2 pi to the 1/4--

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.660
that's for normalization--
square root of a.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.280
And so what is this?

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.920
This is a psi--

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.870
this is a Gaussian-- and the
uncertainty's roughly a--

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.190
is that right?

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.560
Delta x is about a,
because that controls

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.410
the width of the Gaussian.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.760
And now, you have a Gaussian
that you have to evolve.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.450
And what's going
to happen with it?

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.940
This Gaussian, as
written, doesn't

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.930
represent a moving Gaussian.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.450
To be a moving
Gaussian, you would

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.940
like to see maybe things
of [? the ?] from e

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.970
to the ipx that represent
waves with momentum.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.390
So I don't see anything like
that in this wave function.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:23.000
So this must be a Gaussian
that is just sitting here.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.910
And what is it
going to do in time?

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.460
Well, it's presumably
going to spread out.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.610
So the width is going
to change in time.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.760
There's going to be a time
in which the shape changes.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.940
Will it be similar to
what you have here?

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.679
Yes.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.550
The time will be related.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.360
So time for changes.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.140
So there will be
some relevant time

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.570
in this problem for which
the width starts to change.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:05.980
And it will be related
to ma squared over h bar.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.550
In fact, you will
find that with a 2,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.210
the formulas look
very, very neat.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.990
And that's the relevant time for
the formation of the Gaussian.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.560
So you will do those four steps.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.600
They're all doable
for Gaussians.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.290
And you'll find the
Fourier transform,

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.330
which is another Gaussian.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.730
Then you will put
the right things

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.850
and then try to do
the integral back.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.500
The answer is a
bit messy for psi,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.330
but not messy for psi squared,
which is what we typically

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.250
ask you to find.

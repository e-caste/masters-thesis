WEBVTT

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.830
Now we'd like to talk
about angular velocity.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.020
So for a particle
traveling in a circle,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.100
we've seen that the velocity
can be written as r d theta dt.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.830
In the theta hat direction.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.240
And we've also seen that d
theta dt can be positive,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.917
in which case,
theta is increasing.

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.000
And so the particle is
traveling around the circle

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.310
in this direction.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.270
You can call that the
counterclockwise direction.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.760
We've also seen that d theta dt
can be negative, in which case

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.350
the angle is decreasing, so
the particle's traveling around

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.970
the circle in this direction,
which we could call clockwise.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.020
Let's now look at rotation
in an arbitrary plane.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.120
So if I have a plane
like this and I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.090
have some particle traveling
in a circle like this.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.260
And I have some observer
that's above the plane

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.060
looking down on
this plane, then it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.490
will see this
rotation as being in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.500
the counterclockwise direction.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.380
Whereas if I have another
observer down here

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.220
and they're looking
up at this plane,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.890
they'll see the motion
as being clock wise.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.450
And so you can
see we have a need

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.070
for the more formal definition
for the rotation of this.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.260
And so what we're going to
do is use the right hand rule

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.760
to define a direction
that tells you

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.250
both the direction
it defines the plane

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.060
and it also tells you what the
positive direction of rotation

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.170
is for that plane.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.979
So the way we'll
do this right hand

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.920
rule is we'll take
our right hand,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.190
we'll curl our fingers in the
direction of the rotation.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.670
And our thumb will
point in the direction

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.360
of the positive direction
that we're defining.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.235
So in this case, I'm going
to have an arrow like this.

00:01:57.235 --> 00:01:59.740
I'll call it n hat to indicate
that it's the normal unit

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.301
vector to that plane.

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:02.800
All right.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.120
Let's come back to
this example now,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.440
where the plane of the motion
is this plane of the board.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.450
And let's look at
our two cases again.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
So in the case of d theta
dt positive, our circle

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.960
looks something like this.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.690
And you can see that if
I use my right hand rule,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.810
the plane, the vector that I've
defined, is out of the board.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.520
And I'm going to use this
symbol, a circle with a dot,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.140
to indicate this direction
of out of the board.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.200
In our other case, for d
theta dt less than zero,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.570
our particle is traveling
in this direction.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.670
And so you can see
by my right hand rule

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.560
that now the direction that
I've defined is into the board.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.470
And for that, I'm going to draw
this as an x in the circle.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.390
So these are symbols
that you'll see

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.800
throughout the rest of the
course, the out of the board

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.300
and into the board symbols.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.930
And so now, let's look back
at our coordinate system

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.820
that we've defined.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.100
We have r hat direction
and a theta hat direction.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.600
And in this coordinate
system, there's

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.800
a third direction
that's defined,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.060
which is the k hat
direction, which you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000
can see is out of the board.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.520
And so now, I'm going to
define what we actually call

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.040
the angular velocity as omega.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.730
And I'm going to write
that as d theta dt.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.250
Now, in the k hat
direction, in this case,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.543
it could be in an
arbitrary n hat direction,

00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:38.460
depending on what you're
playing of motion is.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.876
In this case, I'm going to
call it in the k hat direction,

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:45.070
and now you can see that these
signs are going to line up

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.090
with these directions.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.850
So omega, as d theta dt k hat,
when d theta d t is positive,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.490
k hat is in the same
direction as this unit

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.310
normal that we've
defined that defines

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.560
both the plane of the motion
and the direction of the motion.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.120
And when d theta
dt is negative, I

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.480
have that omega is in the
negative k hat direction, which

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.600
is exactly this
direction here that we've

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.680
defined as being the
motion for this plane.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.220
And so this is how we
define angular velocity.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.340
So we can define d theta dt to
be the component of the angular

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.130
velocity omega z, because
it's in the k hat direction.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.670
And we can also define
the angular speed,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.140
which is just omega as being the
absolute value of this angular

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.360
velocity omega.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.420
So that is, in other words,
it's just the absolute value

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.740
of the d theta dt.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.980
So when a particle's
undergoing circular motion,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.020
it has a velocity
that you can describe,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.290
which is the tangential
motion around the circle.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.880
And it also has an
angular velocity,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.040
which we define as being
in a direction that's

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.700
perpendicular to that
direction of rotation.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.840
And it's defined by
the right hand rule.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.690
And now that we have defined
this omega z, the component

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.060
of the angular velocity,
we can rewrite the velocity

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.230
as just being equal to
r times omega z still

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.200
in that theta hat direction.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.230
And so this is another way
that we can write the velocity

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.310
and connect it back to
the angular velocity.

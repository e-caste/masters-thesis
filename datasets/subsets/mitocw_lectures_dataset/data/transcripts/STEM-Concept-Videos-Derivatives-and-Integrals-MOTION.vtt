00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.040
How did MIT undergraduates design a robot
to lift a small model police car and place

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.309
it on top of a model of MIT's great dome?
Calculus! In this video, we'll use calculus

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.179
to describe the motion of rigid bodies and
see how these concepts are used in the field

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.839
of robotics.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.550
This video is part of the Derivatives and
Integrals video series. Derivatives and integrals

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.329
are used to analyze the properties of a system.
Derivatives describe local properties of systems,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.429
and integrals quantify their cumulative properties.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.870
Hello. My name is Dan Frey. I am a professor
in the Mechanical Engineering department at

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.309
MIT, and today I'll be talking with you about
the motion of rigid bodies--both translation

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.190
and rotation.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.170
In order to understand this video you should
be very comfortable with linear motion, including

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.039
position, velocity, and acceleration. You
will want to know how to turn measurements

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.180
in polar coordinates into measurements in
Cartesian coordinates. You should also know

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.479
enough introductory calculus to apply the
chain rule.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.890
After watching this video you should be able
to explain what is meant by the phrase "rigid

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.180
body." You should be able to describe restrictions
on the motion of an object by using constraint

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.619
equations. Finally, you should be able to
use derivatives and integrals to connect different

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.100
mathematical descriptions of rigid body motion.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.640
Our primary examples today will be robots.
Let's look at how basic ideas of motion are

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.350
used in the field of robotics. Here you can
see some footage from a robotics competition

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.350
at MIT. The competition is part of a Mechanical
Engineering course, number 2.007.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.590
One typical task that robots perform is to
grab something, pick it up, and move it. This

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.210
robot uses a gripper, at the end of the arm,
to pick up objects.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.030
One of the difficulties in programming a robot
arm is that we typically have no direct measurement

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.610
of where that gripper is. There's usually
no convenient sort of "position meter" that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.910
could tell its location. Instead we might
determine the location for the base of the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.410
arm, and we can measure the angles for different
parts of the arm. We need to use the measurements

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.410
that we can make in order to determine the
location of
the gripper.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.350
This is made easier by the concept of a "rigid
body." Rigid bodies can translate and rotate,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.820
but they do not bend, stretch, or twist. In
mathematical terms, the distance between any

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.010
two points in the object does not change.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.730
Rigid bodies are idealizations -- to simplify
our work, we imagine that we are working with

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.260
objects that do not deform. This idealization
works best when the object only experiences

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.060
low amounts of force. Higher amounts of force
can lead to objects deforming or breaking,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.620
depending on the object.
The robot we saw earlier is a good example

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.340
of a rigid body. You can see in this video
that as our robot moves, its pieces do not

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.220
bend or distort noticeably, so we can treat
each piece as a rigid body. We could use the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.440
definition of a rigid body to help us determine
the location of points on that robot.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.050
This robot, on the other hand, has a less
sturdy frame. You can see the arm flex as

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.050
the robot moves. We might not want to treat
this arm as a rigid body. Let's try to solve

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.900
a problem involving a rigid body. Here is
a very simple robot arm. It has a "joint"

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.139
on the left that can tilt up and down, and
a piston that can extend its arm. In addition,

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.590
this part of the piston can be considered
a rigid body, so its length will be a constant.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.430
Here is a task for you: describe the acceleration
of the gripper at the end of the arm.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.349
First, set the origin for your coordinate
system. Then, write an expression for the

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.490
x and y position of the gripper in terms of
the quantities shown here.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.610
Once you have that position, use derivatives
to find the velocity and the acceleration

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.050
of the gripper.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.050
Pause the video here to carry out your calculations.
Let's take a look at the answer. First, we

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:06.360
need to choose an origin. Let's choose an
arbitrary location as the origin of our coordinate

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.740
system. Our robot's joint may be moving, so
we will use a pair of functions x sub j of

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.740
time and y sub j of time to describe its location.
X sub j will be the horizontal distance from

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.110
our origin to the joint, and y sub j will
be the vertical distance.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.800
We can use derivatives of these functions
to describe any relative movement that the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.620
joint has when compared with our coordinate
system, such as velocity or acceleration.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.889
This slide shows just the X components of
the answer, with the value x sub j indicating

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.139
the location of the joint. You can see that
the expressions can easily become complicated

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:54.139
if both s and theta change at the same time.
One reason that we want to know the acceleration

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.080
is because some objects respond poorly to
a high acceleration. Here you can see a different

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.849
sort of robot arm lifting a car. Instead of
a gripper, these two robots use a forklift

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.969
design. Their arms must move very gently,
especially as they slow down, or the car will

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:17.969
fall off. The arms are capable of moving more
quickly, but the robot's designers have programmed

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.310
it to use a lower acceleration.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.080
This leads us to a discussion of constraints.
This section will have a few examples, as

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.949
well as several opportunities for you to practice.
Be ready to pause the video.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:39.349
Constraints are any sort of restriction on
a situation. When they can be expressed mathematically,

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:45.490
we refer to Equations of Constraint. These
describe the physical connection between two

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.779
or more rigid bodies.

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:52.259
Constraint equations are useful because they
link one variable to another in a way that

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.779
reduces the total number of variables in a
problem. This helps to make otherwise impossible

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:04.069
problems solvable. Constraint equations are
used throughout physics and mechanical engineering.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:10.240
Some fields refer to a similar idea called
"degree of freedom analysis."

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.939
Here is a classic example of a situation with
a constraint. The car on this roller coaster

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:22.559
cannot leave the tracks. If the track is circular,
we can use the equation for a circle to constrain

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:27.610
our movement. We can use this to reduce the
number of variables in our equations for the

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.808
position of the roller coaster. Rather than
an equation in x and y, we could have equations

00:07:33.808 --> 00:07:40.808
in just x, or just y. We could also use constraints
that involve the distance along the track

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:46.029
or another sensible measurement for the situation
we are investigating.

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:51.620
It's important to note that constraints mean
giving up some freedom in our variables. In

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:58.620
our example, we can only specify x or y, not
both. Once we choose a value for x, there

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.669
are only two y values that will work.

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:09.279
Here's a situation where you can find the
equation of constraint. A cart is being pulled

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:14.889
across a flat surface, and the wheels turn
without slippingâ€”effectively, the wheel

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:21.800
is constrained to move only by rolling and
not in any other way: no lifting up, no sliding,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:28.309
no peeling out. Can you find an equation that
connects x, the distance the cart has moved,

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:32.010
to theta, the amount that the wheels have
turned?

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:39.010
Pause the video here to discuss this in class.
Here is an arm that is fairly complex -- it

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.820
has many joints. Pause the video and write
down the variables and constants you would

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:56.820
use for this robot.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.780
There are three separate angles that must
be recorded, as well as the extension of the

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:09.310
arm. There are also three pieces of constant
length.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:16.120
Now we have an opportunity to describe a constraint
in a complex situation. We could choose, for

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:22.200
example, to constrain the motion of the arm
to just the horizontal direction. Because

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.540
there are many variables in this situation,
there are many possible ways to satisfy the

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.820
constraint.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.890
Write an expression for just the vertical
position of the gripper in terms of the quantities

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:39.550
shown. Once you have done that, answer this
question: how might we move the gripper in

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.310
just the horizontal direction?

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:48.870
You should come up with at least two ways
that we could do this, and describe them mathematically.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.470
Your teacher will then lead the class in a
discussion of your answers. Pause the video

00:09:53.470 --> 00:10:00.470
here to do this.
Here is a simulation of a "hydrabot" doing

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:08.190
exactly what you just calculated: moving one
end horizontally. You can see that it matches

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:15.190
up quite well with our hypothetical robot.
Examine its motion closely--is this one of

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.410
the motions you described? Are there extra
constraints present here? What freedom of

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:27.030
motion did we give up by making our choice?

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.630
Let's review.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.520
Today you used derivatives to find the velocity
and acceleration of an object based on its

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.200
position.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.300
You also learned the definition of a rigid
body: that it does not bend or stretch when

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.600
force is applied.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.170
Finally, you saw that constraint equations
can reduce the total number of equations in

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.640
a system, thus making problems easier to solve.
I hope you enjoyed seeing some applications

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.190
of basic motion concepts. Good luck in your
further investigation of physics and engineering!

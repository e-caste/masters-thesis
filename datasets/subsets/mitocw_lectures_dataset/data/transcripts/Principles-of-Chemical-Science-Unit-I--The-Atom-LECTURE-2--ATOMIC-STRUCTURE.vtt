00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.139
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Let's
try the countdown again.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:24.680
You can just give
it to them for now.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.820
We'll figure it out later.

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:47.040
I like to ask people
to explain, now

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.430
that they know what
the right answer is,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.219
if someone will explain why
that is the right answer.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.260
And I know it's a big
class, and people sometimes

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.880
get nervous about talking.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.740
So I bribe people.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.630
So today, the person who
answers why that is correct

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.488
will get an MIT
chemistry T-shirt.

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:07.987
OK.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.890
AUDIENCE: All right, let's see.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.590
If you're using 5
moles of N2, you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.450
need 15 moles of hydrogen gas.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.560
Since there's not
enough hydrogen gas--

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.160
there's only 10 moles-- that
means the hydrogen gas should

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.990
be the limiting reactant since
you would need roughly 3.33

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.619
moles of N2 for it.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.660
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Great.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.932
And here is an MIT
chemistry T-shirt.

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:38.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.955
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, so you'll
notice that the prizes are

00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:47.330
good in the beginning, get
worse throughout the semester,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.580
and get good again at the end.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.950
So keep that in mind.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.780
OK, so let's try to get started.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.530
It's been a little
bit of a crazy start.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.363
If people are still
having clicker problems,

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:59.660
we have a couple more clicker
questions that you can try out.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.930
And we'll get your clickers
working by the end of class

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.920
today.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.010
So the topics--
today, we're going

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.560
to be talking about the
discovery of the electron

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.420
and of the nucleus.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.420
And I said that there's
going to be limited amounts--

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
or every time I have a
lecture that has some history,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.840
I'm going to counter that
with some modern chemistry.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.790
So next week,
we're going to have

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.870
two examples of modern uses.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.070
But today, we're going
to do a little history.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.460
And I like history,
especially when

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.990
it can lead to a cool demo.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.310
So you might have noticed
something demo-like came in

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.910
while we were
doing the clickers.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.280
So that's always good.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.560
And I also like
talking about history

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.820
when I feel like it's a
great example of a challenge

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.370
that chemists face, and
really, most scientists

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.550
face, that they used to face
and still currently face,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.010
which is that chemists
study small particles.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.110
They study things
that are really tiny.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.690
How do you study something
that's really small?

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.810
How do you demonstrate
that something

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.820
that is invisible to
the eye actually exists?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.640
So this is a common challenge.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.740
And so today, I'm
going to tell you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.230
about how the electron
and the nucleus

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.830
were discovered at
a very low-tech time

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.080
in our scientific
history, how they

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.980
were able to figure this out.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.340
And let me just set the stage
of what people were thinking

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.860
around this time, and how
these discoveries really

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.000
changed everything.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.850
So in the late 1890s, chemists
were patting each other

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.570
on the back.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.840
And physicists too were
thinking, boy, we have it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.100
all figured out.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.280
We have a real, complete
understanding of our universe.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.460
We have atomic theory of matter.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.960
We have Newtonian mechanics.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.180
This is really great.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.250
And in fact, someone
said these words,

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.530
which are really
dangerous words,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.690
that our future
discoveries must be looked

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.320
for in the sixth decimal place.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.380
So honestly, when I
started studying chemistry,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.420
I thought everything
about chemistry

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.920
was probably already known.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.590
And it was just
fine tuning things.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.840
I was absolutely
wrong at that time.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.670
And this statement
was absolutely wrong,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.670
and it really came right
before the major discovery

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.459
of the electron, where they
realized they hadn't really

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.330
understood anything about
the atomic theory of matter.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.050
So more experiments are
always dangerous because they

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.610
can change everything.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.830
And that's why I
really like science.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.320
All right, so the experiment
I'm going to tell you today,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.440
JJ Thompson's discovery
of the electron.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.800
Or one of the experiments
I'll tell you about today,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.300
and this is really a
pretty simple experiment.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.570
So JJ Thompson was interested in
this thing called cathode rays.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.810
He had hydrogen gas, and then
he took an evacuated glass

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.320
cylinder.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.000
And he put hydrogen gas in it.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.280
And then he applied
a current to that,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.590
and he could see
these rays coming off.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.450
And he thought that
was pretty cool.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.000
And so he was wondering
about these rays.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Are they made up of
negatively charged particles,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.750
possibly charged
particles, maybe neutral?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.300
What are these things?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.400
So he decided to
do this experiment.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.670
And he wondered whether
if he took two plates

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.030
and had charges associated
with them, whether he

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.970
would see the cathode
rays deflected or not.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.430
Well, first, he didn't
apply any current,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.090
so it was just neutral, just to
see if putting these plates in

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.790
would affect
anything in any way.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.650
And so when he did
that, when there

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.270
was zero voltage difference
between these two plates,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.530
he could see the cathode ray
hit this phosphor screen.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.559
And there was no deflection.

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.100
All right, then he
said, OK, now, I'm

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.300
going to charge things up, and
see if I can see a deflection.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.110
So he did that, and
he saw the following.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.660
There was a deflection.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.710
And so now, the different
voltage between the plates

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.600
was greater than 0.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.610
And now, he saw
the cathode ray was

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.470
being deflected a different
distance of delta x over here.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.860
And it was being deflected
toward the positive plate.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.360
So that said to him that
the cathode ray contained

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.060
negatively charged particles.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.540
You'll notice that the word
"negatively" is the only word

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.650
on the screen in blue.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.400
And if you look at
your notes, you'll

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.650
see that there's a blank spot.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.320
Just pointing out there
might be a correlation there.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:37.120
OK, so he knew some things
also from classical work

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.520
that was done in the time.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.710
And I didn't reset my boards.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.040
So he knew something
about what it meant

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.690
if there was just deflection.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.470
So we had our deflection of the
negatively charged particles.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.210
And he knew that
that was going to be

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.200
proportional to the
charge of the negatively

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.480
charged particle.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.630
And it was going to be
directly proportional to that,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.280
and inversely proportional
to the mass of the negatively

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.190
charged particle.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.830
So it was a pretty big
deflection, so he wasn't sure.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.930
Maybe there was a
very big charge,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.530
or maybe there was a very
small mass, or maybe both.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.560
So then he wanted to see
what happened if he really

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.020
got things going,
and he applied even

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.070
more of voltage difference.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.600
So he did that.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.440
And when he did
that, he saw this.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.440
He saw another deflection, but
this time, it was much smaller.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.910
And it was toward the
negatively charged plate.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.320
So he realized that, in addition
to the negatively charged

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.900
particle, there was also a
positively charged particle.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:05.270
So for that particle,
then, the deflection

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.850
of the positively
charged particle

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.320
should also be proportional to
the charge on the positively

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.500
charged particle, and inversely
proportional to the mass

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.800
of the positively
charged particle.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.980
But there was a big
difference in this deflection.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.830
Toward the positive plate,
there was a big deflection.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.580
And toward the negative
plate, it was pretty small.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:38.030
So he knew that this deflection
was much bigger than that one.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.890
And then he thought
about-- is that going

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.990
to be due to charge or mass?

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.980
But he said, the charges
should be the same

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.530
because it's neutral normally.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.920
So those charges must equal
each other, the absolute values

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.270
at least, must equal each other.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.440
So then we can think
about the comparison

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.462
of these deflections.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.440
So if we can take the absolute
value of the deflection

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.050
of the negatively
charged particle

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.430
over the absolute value of the
deflection of the positively

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.430
charged particle,
on the top here,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.390
we're going to have the
charge of the negatively

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.030
charged particle over the
mass of the negatively

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.020
charged particle.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.960
And the absolute
value of that term

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.150
over the charge
of the positively

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.690
charged particle, over the
mass of the positively charged

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.220
particle.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.240
But now, if you say
that the charges are

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.120
equal to each other, at least
the absolute values of them,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.760
we can get rid of that term.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.550
And just see that the mass
then, of the positively charged

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.440
particle over the negatively
charged particle, remains.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.980
So if this is going to be
big, and we know it is,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.530
it's a big difference.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.460
The negatively charged
particle deflected

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.970
a lot more than the
positively charged particle.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.760
That means that the difference
in masses also has to be big,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.970
and that that negatively charged
particle must be a lot smaller

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.500
in mass than the positively
charged particle.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.197
So if we go up a
little bit here-- oops.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.050
So the mass of the
negatively charged particle

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.960
must be a lot smaller than the
mass of the positively charged

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.860
particle.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:49.020
And actually, it's about
2,000 times smaller.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.480
So he was able to
figure all this out

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.430
by just doing this
pretty simple experiment.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:59.860
So he had now a small,
negatively charged particle,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.680
and also a positively
charged particle.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.390
And later, the negatively
charged particle got a name.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.820
The negatively charged particle
got the name of the electron.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.310
And its mass was determined
in an another interesting

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.210
experiment I won't
tell you about.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.980
And it was determined to be
really small, about 9 times 10

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.360
to the minus 31 kilograms.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.410
So through this
experiment, he was

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.010
able to figure out, that
in these cathode rays,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.520
you had something that
was tiny, this electron.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.780
And that means this idea that
atoms were the smallest thing

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.995
out there was incorrect.

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:36.340
That's what everyone believed.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.810
They were patting
themselves on the back.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.080
They had figured it all out.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.996
But there was something
smaller than the atom.

00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:43.210
There was this electron,
this negatively

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.196
charged particle
that was really tiny.

00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:48.070
So it is pretty cool.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.444
It's a pretty
low-tech experiment

00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:52.270
that figured out something that
really changed the way that we

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.210
thought about science.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.410
So what about the nucleus?

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.360
So we had the
electron, and we also

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.310
had this idea there was
something positively

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.690
charged going on there.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.720
And of course, in that
experiment, that was H plus.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.810
But what about the nucleus?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.230
So Rutherford is credited with
the discovery of the nucleus.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.800
So this was a little later.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.990
And he had been studying
radioactive material.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.360
And his good friend,
Marie Curie, from France

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.130
would often send him interesting
samples for him to study.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.570
I'm not sure quite how they
got from France to England.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.340
Some of these were really
cancer causing things.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.810
I don't know how many people
touched them without safety

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.740
precautions on the way.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.870
But anyway, it's interesting to
note that Rutherford actually

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.250
did not die of cancer,
despite this research.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.830
He was literally the
victim of his own success.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.480
So after his great
discovery of the nucleus,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.570
which I'll tell you about,
he was made into a knight.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.530
And at one point,
he became sick.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.880
And he needed a doctor.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.720
Well, if you're a
knight in England,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.910
you can't just have any
old doctor treat you.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.580
You need to have a doctor
that is also a knight.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.580
And so while he was
waiting for a doctor

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.420
of the appropriate ranking to
come and treat him, he died.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.770
So he literally died
of his own success.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.410
He was a victim of
his own success.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.220
But it wasn't just his success
as I'll tell you about.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:24.977
He had some help.

00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:26.560
He had a really good
graduate student,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.370
a really good undergraduate
student helping him out.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.040
So he was studying
these alpha particles

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.250
that were being emitted from
this radioactive material.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.280
And we know now that this
is Helium plus 2 ions.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.820
But that was not
known at the time.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.100
They just knew
something was coming out

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.370
of this radioactive
material, and they

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.490
wanted to find out what
it was, and characterize

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.040
the properties of this.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.980
So he had a post-doc
named Hans Geiger.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.140
And this is the Geiger
of the Geiger counter.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.860
And he also had an undergraduate
student, E. Marsden.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.230
And so together, they did
the following experiment.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.970
And I wasn't obviously there,
but I'm imagining that by "they

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.530
did the following
experiment," it

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.860
meant the undergraduate
and the graduate student,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.500
or maybe even just
the undergraduate.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.770
OK, so here is the experiment.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.050
They had the
radioactive material.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.240
Alpha particles were
coming off, and they

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.270
had built a detector that would
count how many alpha particles

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.860
were coming off.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.840
And so they did the
experiment, and they counted.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.060
And they found there
were a lot of particles,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.950
132,000 alpha particles
per minute, in fact.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.230
So then they said,
OK, let's see what

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.520
happens if we put
a piece of foil

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.340
in the path of the
alpha particles.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.720
And we're going to have
really, really thin gold foil.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.670
So this is like smaller
than a human hair.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.610
This is really,
really thin foil.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.130
And they shot alpha
particles at it.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.260
And they counted.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.350
And they got
approximately-- I don't

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.460
know how many significant
figures-- but 132,000 alpha

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.780
particles.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.780
Seemed to be, in terms of the
significant figures, the same.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.990
So it was just going through.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.560
These alpha particles
were just going

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.170
through this thin, gold foil.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.220
So they had this vision
then of the gold atoms

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.140
being all empty space, and
the alpha particles were just

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.910
going through, no problem.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:38.100
But then they did
one more experiment.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.530
And by then, I think this
was the undergraduate.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.080
So they built this detector.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.670
And they had built the
detector so it could move.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.640
So sometimes when you design
something to do something,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.840
you actually want
to use it for that.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.680
So if we have the alpha
particles coming this way

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.600
and on the detector over here.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.850
And it had been sitting,
and I've been collecting it.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.380
The undergraduate
was told, well,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.210
put the detector over
there, and see what happens.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:09.130
So the undergraduate moved
the detector over here.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.320
And he said, you're going to
see if the alpha particles hit

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.600
the gold foil and backscatter.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.210
So we'll have the
detector over here.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.460
So the undergraduate did this.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.376
They didn't think it was
going to do anything.

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.970
They needed something for
the undergraduate to do.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.160
So they had him do that.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.070
And then they counted.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.970
And sure enough, click, click.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.720
It wasn't a lot,
but there seemed

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.440
to be some backscatter,
about 20 counts,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.740
20 alpha particles per minute.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.540
That was not expected.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.140
They were expecting 0.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.680
So they were detecting
backscattering.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.490
The alpha particles
were bouncing off

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:02.070
that thin, gold foil, and coming
back at the moved detector.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:07.170
So they could calculate this
probability of backscattering,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.210
the account rate of
the backscattering

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.560
over the normal count
of the particles.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.700
And so they had 20
backscattering events,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:25.359
or 20 counts over the 132,000,
2 times 10 to the minus 4,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.349
or 0.02%.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.290
This is small, very small.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.190
But it was not 0.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.830
And I don't know how many
times they did this experiment,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.626
but I can imagine
there were lots

00:17:36.626 --> 00:17:39.000
of times they did the experiment
that no one would really

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.470
believe this result.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.240
And Rutherford himself said,
"it was about as credible

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.560
as if you had fired
a 15-inch shell

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.060
at a piece of tissue paper,
and it came back and hit you."

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.450
So that's how he felt about it.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.240
He was like, I don't
understand how this is working.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.590
This is so thin.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.920
It's like tissue paper, but
yet these alpha particles

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.640
are bouncing off something.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.980
So what did this all mean,
once they had repeated

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.080
the experiment many times?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.130
So their interpretation, then,
was that these gold atoms

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.100
were, in fact, mostly empty.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.860
It seemed like all the
alpha particles were just

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.020
going through.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.950
Most of them were just
passing through and not

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.090
hitting anything.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.350
But there was something in
there that could be hit.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:30.240
There was some concentrated
mass in this volume

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.240
that, when the alpha particle
hit that directly, it

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.310
backscattered.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.290
And they later called
this the nucleus.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.040
So they came up then with
this new model, the Rutherford

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.140
model, where you had
mostly empty space.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.060
But you had
concentrated mass inside

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.790
that an alpha particle might
hit and then backscatter.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.190
And Rutherford assumed
that the electrons would

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.360
be in that empty space, and
that this positive mass was

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.070
going to be positively charged.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.880
Because he knew the overall
atom was going to be neutral.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.060
So just a little nomenclature.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.770
We can think about the charge
of the electrons in the atom

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.910
as being equal to
minus Z to the e, where

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.220
Z is our atomic number,
and e is the absolute value

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.110
of the electron's charge.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:30.810
And if this term is negative,
then the charge on the nucleus

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.080
is going to be positive.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.610
So we have positive Z to the
e, because overall, the atom

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.880
is going to be neutral.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.480
Then Rutherford went
on to actually use

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.510
this backscattering to measure
the diameter of this positively

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.880
charged, dense part of
the atom, of the nucleus.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.390
And he was able to
measure that diameter

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.520
as a very small number, 10
to the minus 14th meters.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.970
So he did this with this
back scattering experiment.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.970
So you might say, how
can you get a diameter

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.380
from this backscattering?

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.340
And so that's what we're going
to try right now ourselves.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.460
We're going to do an experiment,
and Professor Sylvia Ceyer

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.590
originally came up with the
experiment to do in class.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:27.560
And so she built the first
version of this gold foil

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.430
right here.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.430
And originally, she
took something apart

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.930
from her own research program.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.110
Since then, it's been
replicated so that she doesn't

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.170
have to shut down her
research lab every year when

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.720
we do this experiment in class.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.680
So here, imagine this
as a piece of gold foil.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.180
And it's mostly empty
space, but there

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:57.780
are some small, concentrated
nuclei, gold nuclei,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.790
these Styrofoam balls.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:05.820
And if we have, over
here, some alpha

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:11.130
particles, which we happen
to have 502 alpha particles.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:19.740
If the alpha particle hits
the concentrated part,

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.150
it should back scatter.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.100
Otherwise, it should go through.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.299
So you are now going to
be radioactive material.

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:27.840
I don't know.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.160
Is that the first time
you've been called

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.340
radioactive material?

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:30.986
I'm not sure.

00:21:34.124 --> 00:21:35.415
But we're going to come around.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.880
Everyone can have
one or two of these.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.635
So let me just tell you.

00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:53.040
You need to watch
your ping pong ball.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.130
Once you get it, you
can move to the center.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.020
Watch your ping pong ball.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.250
If it hits the edge of this,
it's not a backscatter.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.370
Watch if it goes through
or if it backscatters.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.180
And you will click in whether
you had a backscatter event

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.140
or not.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.740
And from that information,
we will calculate

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.645
the diameter of the nucleus.

00:22:19.284 --> 00:22:20.700
Do you want to put
up the clicker?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.770
I think everyone's good.

00:22:43.354 --> 00:22:44.340
Do we have any more?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.820
OK, everyone, if you want to
get up and get a better vantage

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.260
point, do so.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.210
And let the experiment begin.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.670
I'm moving out of the way.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:20.930
OK, so go ahead, and say whether
you had 1, 2, or 0 backscatter

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:21.430
events.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.980
And if your clicker
isn't working,

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.900
we'll ask you to raise
your hand and tell us,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.895
especially if it was
a backscatter event.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.520
Has everyone had a
chance to click in?

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.990
Has everyone clicked in?

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.230
You can't tell.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.040
All right, we're
going to countdown.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.709
Go ahead and click
in, and then we're

00:25:09.709 --> 00:25:10.875
going to do the calculation.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.550
OK, actually, we need to
calculate the actual number

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.394
of them, not the percent.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.800
All right, so we had
some backscatter events.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.040
So let's see if we can
use this information

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:59.760
to actually calculate the
diameter of the gold nuclei.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.180
All right, so we are going
to talk about the probability

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.130
of backscattering.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:11.820
So we have a probability is
equal to the number of ping

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:25.630
pong balls backscattered,
backscattered

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.210
over the total number.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:38.620
And this will be related to
the radius of those gold nuclei

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.310
by the following.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.950
So we have the
probability is going

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:49.600
to be equal to the area of
the nuclei, the total area

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.620
over the area of the whole atom.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.720
So basically, the piece
of foil-- and then that's

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:06.580
going to be further equal to
the number of nuclei times

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:22.150
the area per nucleus, again,
over the area of all the atoms,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.060
or the piece of foil.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.980
OK, so we know some
of this information.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.540
So I'm going to move this up.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.070
You have an actual number.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.022
36 total?

00:27:35.022 --> 00:27:35.980
Oh, that's interesting.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.230
OK, that's a lot
of backscattering.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.740
OK, so we can plug in
some of these numbers now.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.650
So we have the probability
is going to be equal.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.850
Someone counted.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.210
I didn't count,
but someone counted

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.155
that there were 120 nuclei.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:58.990
And the area is going
to be pi r squared.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.480
And someone measured
the entire frame,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:10.780
or the size of the piece of
film, as a 139,000 centimeters

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.040
squared.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:19.280
Or it was 1.39 meters squared.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.910
OK, so we'll assume that
they counted the nuclei

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.420
to three significant figures.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.780
So it's exactly 120.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.980
And we'll assume that they
measured the box with three

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.830
significant figures as well.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:37.090
So now we can solve
this for r, the radius,

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.040
or for the diameter.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.590
So if we now solve
for the radius,

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.420
we'll bring the radius over.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.870
And we'll have the square
root of the probability.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.349
And if we take these
numbers, and I did the math.

00:28:52.349 --> 00:28:53.890
I have a calculator,
if someone wants

00:28:53.890 --> 00:29:02.600
to check-- 6.072 centimeters.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.230
And then the diameter is going
to just be equal to twice that.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.500
So we have the square
root of the probability

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:16.330
times 12.14 centimeters.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:20.890
And now, we need to
calculate the probability.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.810
So the probability is going to
be the number of backscatter,

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.520
which was 36.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:36.340
36 over 502, someone
have a calculator?

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.660
Someone check my math.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.280
Check math for me.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.815
Check math, anybody.

00:29:40.815 --> 00:29:41.940
I don't have another prize.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.480
Thank you.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.940
Was it 26 or 36?

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.104
I can't read up there.

00:29:50.104 --> 00:29:52.097
AUDIENCE: You said it's
12 single or double?

00:29:52.097 --> 00:29:53.180
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Double.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.670
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.172
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Excellent,
checking math for me, here.

00:30:00.172 --> 00:30:01.857
AUDIENCE: I can't
do math in my head.

00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:07.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
roughly 500 [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.570
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
OK, 26, and so

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.650
what does this come out to be?

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.150
{}

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.470
AUDIENCE: 0.050.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:22.420
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0.050, And
now we need to plug that in.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:37.560
So we have d equals the square
root of 0.050 times 12.14.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.246
And what does that
come out to be?

00:30:45.910 --> 00:31:00.240
2.71-- and the actual was 2.5.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.740
Not bad.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.700
So using methods
very similar to this,

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.830
Rutherford was
able to figure out

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.130
what the diameter
of the nucleus was.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:20.280
And this was a really important
achievement of the time.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:29.790
OK, so in the last few minutes,
maybe I'll move this down.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.750
In the last few
minutes, I want to talk

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.620
about the fall out of all
of these great experiments

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.730
and all of these great results.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:42.590
So we now know there is
an electron and a nucleus.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.920
So there are
subatomic particles.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.530
What does that mean in terms
of what people thought they

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.325
understood about atomic theory?

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.660
So we had this question then.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.940
OK, so we have a nucleus,
positively charged,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.540
and electron,
negatively charged.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.010
And there's a
distance between them.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:11.550
And wanted to know,
why do they stay apart?

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:16.000
Why does the electron not
crash into the nucleus?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.210
So from classical
description, we

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.990
have Coulomb's Force
Law, which tells us

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.950
about the force
when you have two

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:33.280
charged particles, Q1 and Q2,
so the charge on the particles.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.230
And you have over
4 times pi times

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:43.900
this permittivity constant
times the distance, r, squared.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:49.990
So if you apply a force then,
and you have charged particles,

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.180
if those particles
have the same sign,

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.200
then acceleration
should push them apart.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.170
The force should be
positive and repulsive.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.020
So two things with
the same charge

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.730
don't want to be
near each other.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.190
It's going to be repulsive.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.190
If, like in this case,
you have two things

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.520
that have opposite
signs, acceleration

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.520
should pull them together.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.110
And here the force should
be negative and attractive.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.240
So that's the situation
we're in here,

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.000
positively charged nucleus,
negatively charged electron.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.866
So let's consider
then a hydrogen atom.

00:33:32.866 --> 00:33:38.290
It equals one
electron, one proton.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.620
Let's think about
what happens when

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.220
you have an infinite
distance between them.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.860
So if they're
infinitely far apart,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.110
what is going to be the force?

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.370
You can just yell
out the answer.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:51.910
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.306
CATHERINE DRENNAN: 0, right.

00:33:53.306 --> 00:33:54.430
They don't feel each other.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.380
They don't know anything
about each other.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.260
They're infinitely far apart.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.430
There's no force.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.780
But that's not going to be
the situation in the atom.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.750
Atoms are small.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.601
So they're going to be
somewhat near each other.

00:34:07.601 --> 00:34:09.100
Now, we can think
about what happens

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.064
if they're right on top
of each other and are a 0.

00:34:12.064 --> 00:34:14.230
And here, we can try out
the clickers one more time.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.889
OK, so we'll do 10 seconds.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.041
Oh, the colors changed.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:46.889
So most people had it's
infinitely attractive.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:53.969
So infinitely attractive, like
most chemists, except Avogadro.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.469
He's very strange looking.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:35:00.370
OK, so if these things are
going to be close to each other,

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.190
then they should be
attracted to each other

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.710
and collapse into each other.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.860
So why then are the
electron and the nucleus

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.570
that are infinitely
attracted to each

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.736
other-- why do they stay apart?

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:19.730
So Coulomb's Law is not
helping us understand this.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.730
But it's really just talking
about the force with respect

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.210
to a distance.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.230
It's not telling us
anything about what happens

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.520
when r changes with time.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.820
So we'll find in chemistry
sometimes that things

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.550
are spontaneous
in one direction,

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.190
but they're also very slow.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.360
So you don't have that
the thing doesn't happen,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.730
it's just kinetically very slow.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.310
So let's consider time now.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.300
Maybe that will
help us understand

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.880
why this is not working.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.020
It doesn't, but
let's look at that.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.270
So what do we know about time?

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.480
What do we know about
acceleration and force in time?

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.020
We need a classical
equation of motion

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.830
that can explain how the
electron and the nucleus

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.510
could move under force.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.400
So we have our good friend.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.590
We have Newton's Second Law.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:12.210
We have f equals Ma, force
equals mass times acceleration.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.360
So let's think about
what this tells us

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.230
about the electron
and the nucleus.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:23.250
So we can express force
as a function of velocity.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:28.940
We can also do that
in terms of distance.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.750
So now, let's think
about what's happening.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:32.820
We know the force.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.970
We can calculate the force
from the Coulomb's Force

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:41.420
Law, the force between the
nucleus and the electron.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.400
And then we can think about
two different distances,

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.360
and with that force, how
fast the particles should

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.520
move toward each other.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.810
So for the initial distance,
we can put take 0.5 angstroms,

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.380
or 0.5 times 10 to
the 10th meters,

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.090
so that's about the
radius of a hydrogen atom.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.000
So we take that distance.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.360
And then we want to think
about how fast that would then

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.110
go to 0.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:15.510
And it's fast, approximately
10 to the 10th seconds.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.190
Or the electron should
plummet into the nucleus

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.946
in about 0.1 nanoseconds.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.426
It doesn't do that though.

00:37:26.426 --> 00:37:29.000
So we have these
beautiful classical laws.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.360
I'm a big fan of f equals Ma.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.210
I like all these things.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.450
But it's not working to
describe what's happening here.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.050
So we discovered the electron,
discovered the nucleus,

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.410
but now we have a new problem.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.550
We don't understand
why the electron isn't

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.920
plummeting into the nucleus.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.160
So what's the problem here?

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:56.530
So is the problem Coulomb's
Force or Newton's Second Law?

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.280
And it turns out, as most
of you are probably aware,

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.100
it's that classical mechanics
doesn't work when you consider

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.320
things on this size scale.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:11.750
So we need a new way to
describe what's going on here.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.550
Classical mechanics
isn't working.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.990
And so we need
quantum mechanics.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.860
And so that is allowing us
to understand the behavior

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.530
that we're actually observing.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.460
We're not observing
this plummeting,

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.650
so there must be a
better way to do this.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.380
And when you're on this
really small scale,

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.110
you need a different way
to describe the behavior.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.570
And so next week, we're going
to be moving in, and thinking

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:37.980
about quantum mechanics.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.270
And if anyone's still
having clicker questions

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:45.950
or needs a clicker, we'll be
down here to help you out.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:50.140
And otherwise, I will
see you on Monday.

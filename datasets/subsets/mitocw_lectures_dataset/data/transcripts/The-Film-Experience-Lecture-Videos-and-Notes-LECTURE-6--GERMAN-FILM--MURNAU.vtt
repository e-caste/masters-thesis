DAVID THORBURN: This afternoon I
talked a bit about Russian film

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.159
and suggested that
among other things

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.050
that the cultural environment in
which the Russian film emerged

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.840
was an environment of revolution
and of ideological turmoil.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.670
And we could say,
therefore, in some degree,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.000
if Russian film served
revolutionary ideals

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.720
and the ideology
of the Bolsheviks,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.220
the German film had its own sort
of boss, its own authorities

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.260
that it was following.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.420
But it was not in a narrow
sense political or ideological

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.530
as the Russian example was.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.610
But it was something similar.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.220
The German film
I want to suggest

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.170
for a good part of
life, a silent film,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.890
was in thrall to
established culture.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.870
It's an example of
the sort of thing

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.070
I was saying this afternoon
about the difference

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.940
between European cinema
and American cinema.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.000
American cinema grew
up in an atmosphere

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.910
of wild populist
freedom, almost untouched

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.820
by the cultural
authorities who mostly

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.170
on the east coast of
the country dominated

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.890
literature, drama,
and so forth-- music.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.840
In contrast, in
Germany, the film

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.530
grew up in the cultural
centers of the society,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.420
and the dominant cultural
figures, the major writers,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.440
the major dramatists, the
major poets and musicians,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.140
the established theater
actors and directors

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.850
all migrated into the film.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.810
And it gave German film
a tremendous intellectual

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.595
ambition and authority from
its various earliest stages,

00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:07.690
and I'll show you
some examples of this.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.210
It made the German film,
especially the German film

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.400
in the period between the
end of the First World War

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.890
and the advent of
sound that sometimes

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.890
is called-- I don't know
if this is correct--

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.190
but some people call
it the golden age

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.110
of German silent film, the
golden age of German film,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.820
because an extraordinary
number of very

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.950
important and influential
films were made

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.660
in this period, roughly
from about 1916 or '17

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.550
through the '20s,
through about 1926

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.410
or '27 before the
advent of sound.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860
And it certainly is a very
distinctive and influential

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.620
moment in the history
of cinema, but as you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.770
will see in the examples I'm
going to give you, influential

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.460
as many of these
films were, they

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.520
were influential
in what we might

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.800
say-- they were
influential in part

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400
not because they were
wonderful examples

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.930
of exploratory
innovative cinema,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.690
but because of the grandeur
or the disturbing authority

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.120
of the themes they encompassed.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.200
In other words, the German film,
as I suggested this afternoon,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.560
because it was guided by
cultural authorities who

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.530
were adept at earlier
media, at older media,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.960
they already came to the
making of film, of their films,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.210
with high artistic intentions.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.130
I'm not so sure they realized
those intentions, because they

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.030
didn't explore the
full nature of film

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.970
as much as might have been done.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.330
But they were interesting
and deeply influential films.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.180
And I should also admit
that my perspective

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.450
is, perhaps, biased.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.230
There are certainly
many, many people

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.070
who have written
magnificently and seriously

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.570
on this era of German film,
who would not be negative

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.210
as I am about what
I'm calling the sort

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.880
of uncinematic or
unvisual qualities of some

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.350
of the masterpieces, early
masterpieces in the category.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.670
It's a contested argument, and I
don't want you to simply accept

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.410
my word for this.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.740
Take it as a perspective
that could be qualified

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.065
or even challenged
by other folks,

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:06.160
and especially by
certain film scholars

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.780
who see this moment in
German cinema as a really

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.750
fruitful and generative moment.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.950
Much of the basic
understanding that we

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.600
have of German silent film
comes from one remarkable book

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.470
by a woman named
Lottie Eisner, and I

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.900
wanted to mention it here.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.860
I borrowed a tremendous
amount of what

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.210
I'm going to say from her book,
learned a great deal from it.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.830
Eisner was a wonderfully
important historical figure,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.680
worked as a film historian and
annotator and film archivist

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.310
for a good part of her career.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.280
Some of you who
are film buffs may

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.200
know that Wim Wender, as the
great contemporary experimental

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.130
German director,
dedicated his film Paris,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.950
Texas to Lottie Eisner.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.820
She worked for a long time
in the French Biblioteque,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.010
the first great archive of
movies in the Western world.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.810
She also wrote
books, separate books

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.630
about Murnau and Fritz Lang,
two of the great figures

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.520
in this tradition we're looking
at briefly this evening.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.180
And her arguments in
The Haunted Screen

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.830
are still widely accepted.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.780
The book focuses on the
Weimar period, the period

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.720
before the rise of Hitler,
after the First World War,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.880
in which German culture was an
astonishingly rich, fermenting,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.310
stew of innovation and anxiety.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.410
It's the era of
the great cabarets,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.710
and you will return to this
era in an imaginative way

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.740
when you come to see
the film Cabaret later

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.510
in the term, which tries
to reimagine that moment.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.540
And it actually
dramatizes the era

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.610
in which the German films I'm
talking about this evening

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.570
were made.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.570
One way I can begin
to identify or explain

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.840
the distinctive qualities
of these German films

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.750
is to talk briefly about
the idea of expressionism.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.420
The broad word
expressionism refers

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.380
to movement in
modernist art that

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.340
involves principles of
distortion and surreal

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.230
exaggeration.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.030
So an expressionist work
of art, either a painting

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.830
or a poem or a film,
is in some degree

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.280
interested in finding
equivalents for the inner life,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.960
dramatizing not the external
world, but the world within us,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.550
and especially the
tormented world within us--

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.310
our anxieties, our fears,
our sexual fantasies,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.980
our murderous impulses.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.420
There's a dark, disturbing side
to expressionism, especially

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.860
to German expressionism.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.290
There are expressionist artists
who appear in other traditions,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.580
and expressionism is a movement
that goes far beyond Germany.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.990
But one might say that German
expressionism is the expression

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.070
of modernism in German culture.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.740
It's almost indistinguishable.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.880
If we talked about
modernism more generally,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.150
we would say that not
every aspect of modernism

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.300
involves expressionism.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.040
But in Germany, we would say the
modernist impulse was embodied

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.090
in the expressionist tendencies
of the art forms that

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.560
appear in that period.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.070
Let me talk a bit about them.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.100
They involve the
external representation

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.970
of the inner life, as I've said.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.740
And they're interested,
the expressionists,

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.250
in elemental emotions like
fear, love, hatred, anxiety.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.110
They're interested in our
aggressive and appetitive

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.580
impulses.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.810
The sources of this
expressionist movement

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.944
are in German romanticism.

00:07:50.944 --> 00:07:52.360
This is the literary
movement that

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.180
gave rise to important
poets and painters

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.450
in the earlier part
of the 19th century.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.980
And also in economics, in
the historical realities

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.620
of German culture,
because the period we're

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.860
talking about when
these films were made,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.530
the Weimar period
was a period of-- was

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.760
a unstable and turbulent period.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.570
There were power outages all the
time, for example, frequently,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.700
even in the major
cities like Berlin.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.290
And the visual style
of the expressionists--

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.550
there were expressionist
painters, expressionist poets,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.970
expressionist musicians,
expressionist dramatists.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.220
Virtually all the
art forms in Germany

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.650
in some degree participated in
this interest in the irrational

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:50.160
and in the hidden and
in the turbulent night

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.420
side of our personalities.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.400
And I can, perhaps,
very quickly capture

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.670
some of the essence
of this movement

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.340
by showing you a couple of
paintings that are examples

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.354
of this expressionist movement.

00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:06.270
Let me show you one image
first, and then I'll

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.894
do a slideshow while
I talk a bit more,

00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:09.860
and you can watch the slideshow.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:17.600
This is a painting by the
German painter Beckmann,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.140
and it's called "The Family."

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.890
It sometimes has been used as
the illustration on the cover

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.354
of Kafka's The Metamorphosis.

00:09:26.354 --> 00:09:28.020
And we might say
incidentally, if you're

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.000
looking for examples of what
expressionism would be like,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
how many of you have read Kafka?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Only a couple.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.569
OK.

00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:36.360
How many of you remember
the first sentence

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.910
of The Metamorphosis?

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.410
All right.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.470
I'll tell it to you
in some translations.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:49.720
Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
after a night of uneasy dreams

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.780
to find himself transformed
into a gigantic insect.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.240
Maybe the most famous first
sentence in modern literature.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.130
But think about that.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.870
And then the whole
story proceeds

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.516
from that shocking
transformation.

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:05.890
So one of the things that's
characteristic of these forms

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.880
of expression of are
principles of exaggeration

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.970
that take you into surrealism
and into modes of exaggeration

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.550
that attempt to illuminate
reality not by giving you

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.420
a realistic picture of
it, but by exaggerating

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.880
certain elements in reality so
intensely that you understand

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.870
them more deeply and fully
than you might have otherwise.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.930
It's important to recognize
that surreal impulses like this

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.090
or expressionist
impulses like this

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.790
do not mean that the
stories or art forms that

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.530
are committed to
these strategies

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.550
are unrealistic in
the broadest sense.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.947
That is to say they
still talk about reality.

00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:43.780
It's just that the
realities they talk about

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.150
do not allow themselves
to be represented

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.680
in straightforward ways,
because they're either hidden,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.580
or the intensity
that they represent

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.970
is so hidden within us that if
you represent them externally,

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.250
you need to exaggerate.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.420
You need to highlight.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.350
You need to enlarge.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.860
So we might think of Kafka
as a literary embodiment

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.380
of this principle
of expressionism,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.680
and we might think of
paintings like this

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.070
as the painterly
embodiment of it.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.779
And look at this.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.486
We won't have to spend
much time on this,

00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:17.500
but look closely at it.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.020
Look at how the whole
family is crammed together

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.881
in an incredibly tight space,
the ceiling pressing down

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:23.380
on them.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.230
Look how grotesque
each of them is.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.130
But what's the most obvious
thing about the painting?

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.179
Can you see what it looks like?

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:32.220
None of the characters
are looking at each other.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.678
There's no connection
between them.

00:11:33.678 --> 00:11:36.640
They're all isolated in
their own little space.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.400
Not only are they physically
grotesque and a little weird,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.470
but they're all caught in their
own narcissistic or, perhaps,

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.720
drug-induced stupor.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.040
Calling it "The Family?"

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.520
Think of what an unromantic
unsentimental view

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.590
of the family this is.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.360
But it's the principles
of distortion

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.590
and surreal exaggeration that
you can see in this image

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.000
that we might say are
the essence of what

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.030
is meant by expressionism.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.590
Do the slideshow now.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.570
While I'm talking, I'll
show you a series of images

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.860
by other painters,
and we can put this

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.750
on so they'll see what's what.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.820
So just play this,
Kristen, while I continue.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:29.940
So one of the things that--
so this expressionist movement

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.350
was central to all the high arts
of German society at the time.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.510
And it's, therefore,
not an accident,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.870
not at all, not even
remotely an accident

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.630
that such energies
would express themselves

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.220
in the new medium of
the movies, because so

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.660
much of the German
art establishment

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.850
was already embracing
principles of this kind.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.590
And some very
remarkable, of course,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.090
and significant,
immensely influential

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.140
films grew out of this movement.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.760
They emphasized atmospheric
qualities like lighting and set

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.720
design, and they
were interested,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.240
as I've already implied,
in morbid states

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.270
and in distortion, in
inner fears and anxieties.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.380
And what one of the things
that the expressionist moment

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.220
in German cinema
certainly did was

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.530
it tremendously
furthered our sense

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.150
of the power of the cinema to
explore human subjectivity.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.550
Even the films that,
for me at least,

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.810
looked more like
historical artifacts

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.297
than living works of art
have this fascination for us,

00:13:32.297 --> 00:13:34.000
for me.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.890
We might also very
quickly acknowledge

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.330
how profoundly influential
the movement was.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.350
Can you think-- any
of you know what

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.840
famous directors after the--
not even German directors--

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.770
are linked repeatedly
with German expressionism,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.570
have connections to them?

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.280
One of them is
Alfred Hitchcock, who

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.230
actually, his very first
film was a co-production

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.712
with German producers.

00:13:54.712 --> 00:13:56.920
And he carried it-- if you
think of Hitchcock's work,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.090
Hitchcock carries the some of
the darkness and the distortion

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:06.260
and the interest in our
inner convulsive lives

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.280
that is present in
German expressionism.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.190
But there are other
examples as well.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.770
The American gangster
film shows the influence

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:20.280
of German expressionism
very powerfully,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.040
and the great American
director Orson Welles

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.420
was steeped in
German expressionism,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.860
and some of his greatest
effects and the atmospheres

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.830
of his films could be said
to be a direct outgrowth

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.850
of expressionist directing,
of expressionist movies.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.960
So it's a critical
and powerful movement.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.800
So let me now turn to
a couple of examples

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.100
to give you a sense in film
of how this expressed itself.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.320
And my first example comes from
the film, the very famous film

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:55.080
directed by Robert Wayne, called
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.314
It's a story about a murderer,
who when he goes to sleep,

00:15:00.314 --> 00:15:01.980
he turns into a
monster, and he wakes up

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.650
and he walks around like a
somnambulist ready to kill

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.380
people.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.960
And it may be there
were, of course,

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.820
lurid stories in
the public press

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.410
of these kinds of all the time.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.417
So there may have been, in
the watching of the film,

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:20.000
there may have also been a kind
of [INAUDIBLE] in the audience

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.450
of feeling that what they
were watching potentially

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.750
was possibly real or
reflected certain forms

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.800
of certain possibilities
in reality.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.350
But as you'll see, the film
is tremendously stylized.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:43.020
It's tremendously
planned in a way.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.700
One of the most interesting
things about the film

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.210
is that the sets were
designed and painted

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.350
by prominent
expressionist artists,

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.520
and then the fact is it
was as much an artwork

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.730
as it was a movie.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.290
Let me show you part of it,
and you could see for yourself

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:05.010
the consequences of an
artistic movement that

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:10.550
grows out of traditional
art being transferred

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.460
to the movies.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.010
Here's a scene from the film.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.900
Do we have sound?

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.240
No sound, I guess.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.740
Sorry.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.320
There would have been music, of
course, and very scary music.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:32.990
Maybe you can hear some of it.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.560
I think their soundtrack
is also a new one.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.920
It was superimposed and
made for the film later.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.250
But I suppose in a certain way,
this has a kind of interest.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.370
But do you see how static
it is, how uncinematic it

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:57.330
is, how stable the camera
is, how the emphasis is

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.854
on-- I don't know.

00:16:58.854 --> 00:16:59.770
What could we call it?

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.910
On set design, on
surreal angles,

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:10.900
on this strange
form of lighting?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.230
This chiaroscuro black and white
lighting, very great emphasis

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.490
on contrast between black
and white, of course,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.180
becomes a trademark element
of expressionistic films

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.220
and then is carried over in
many other film traditions,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.410
including the American
tradition called film

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.510
noir-- dark film, black film.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.670
So here's this
somnambulist walking over

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.890
to the sleeping woman.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.230
We might note parenthetically,
isn't interesting

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.720
how long one might say that this
is one of the earliest horror

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.650
films?

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.420
How long has the
horror film used

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.760
as one of its central
elements violence

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.460
against women, and especially
sexual violence against women?

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.140
Look at this.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.300
Do you see how he looks
like an actor on a stage?

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.885
Now surely it was intentional
that they put those two men who

00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:29.170
were woken up by the noise in a
space that seems without space.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.230
There's a surreal ungrounded
element in the film.

00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:35.580
All right.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.965
So they're looking for
her now, and they're

00:18:37.965 --> 00:18:39.317
going to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:39.317 --> 00:18:40.900
Can you speed up,
Kristen, so we don't

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.720
watch the whole thing
in slow motion, in full,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720
but we get near the end?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.030
Is that possible to do?

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:55.940
So they're-- keep-- let it
speed up a little bit more.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.890
OK.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.620
Now we're near the ending here.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.234
Again, see how static it
is, how that's impressive,

00:19:02.234 --> 00:19:04.400
the building of the sets
might have been impressive.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.510
But you see how in some
sense how uncinematic

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.645
this is in certain ways?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.820
Seeing the camera stable in one
spot, active moving toward it,

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.520
moving in and out of
the camera's range.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.530
This is a theatrical idea of
what the camera should do.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.110
It's sitting in the
audience watching a set,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:34.120
and in fact, you can feel the
theatrical authority here.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.390
Watch this image now.

00:19:37.835 --> 00:19:39.960
And then it's something
clever if you're interested

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.690
in silhouettes, creating an
image of darkness and horror,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.190
I guess.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.150
But you can also see
the limitations of it.

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:56.570
I want to show you one other
example, a more distinguished

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.960
example, an example
that does begin

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.310
to manipulate the visual
image in somewhat more

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.360
rich and significant ways,
a film even more influential

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.270
than Caligari, what
is called so often

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.080
the first science-fiction film.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.480
It was the very first feature
length science-fiction film

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.240
in the world.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.310
Its title is Metropolis,
directed by Fritz Lang.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.440
And at the time,
many film scholars

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.720
claim it cost something like
five million Reichsmarks

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.252
to make.

00:20:26.252 --> 00:20:28.710
I don't know if Reichsmarks
were the equivalent of dollars,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.700
but let's assume they were.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.570
In 1926, this was the
most expensive film

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.780
that had ever been
made up to that point,

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.990
and it is a measure of the
authority and the prestige

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.320
that movies had
in German society,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.454
that so much money would
be invested in a film.

00:20:44.454 --> 00:20:46.620
This would never have
happened in the United States.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.440
They weren't spending that level
of money on American movies.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.360
They didn't have to.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.140
They couldn't.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.450
And in some sense, it
shows you the authority

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.570
and the centrality,
but it also explains

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.810
why we had to wait before
the German film fully

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.580
discovered its cinematic
or its filmic essence.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.190
And I'm going to
show you what I think

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.070
is the moment or one of the
moments in which this discovery

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.100
was made.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.540
And the director we're
looking at tonight, FW Murnau,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.400
is the director who
made this discovery

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.130
and freed the camera from
the constraints of high art,

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.640
from the constraints of the
inherited attitudes toward art

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.360
that the established culture
in Europe and especially

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.820
in Germany imposed
upon the making.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.970
So here are a couple of
scenes from Metropolis.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.240
Still, I think we're
not fully there yet,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.330
but it's a significant film.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.470
It's much admired by
certain film scholars,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.720
although not by me.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.101
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.040
Some of you may notice
how Chaplin borrowed

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.885
from this introduction.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.890
And you could certainly see
how this film influenced

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.695
Modern Times.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.950
Feel a lot of Chaplin
there, I hope.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.270
You think there's an idea
or an attitude toward what

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.590
labor means in these images?

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.060
These are the
workers of the city.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.020
Interesting that such a
politically radical film

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.555
would be so heavily financed.

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:53.980
That's enough of this.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.550
That's plenty of this, too
much of it, in fact, I think.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.560
But can we speed up
a little, Kristen?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.130
I think we can come to one more
image from a different part

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:02.790
of the film.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.940
So I won't talk about the
plot of the film, which

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.660
is rather ridiculous I
think, although it's also

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.690
a kind of science-fiction
fantasy, a dystopian fantasy.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.420
But there is a sequence
later in the film.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.340
Let's go further.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.340
So here's another image,
another moment from the film.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.400
Visually more
exciting, but it also

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.690
shows you in some sense
how literary the film is.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.370
And also, I want
you see it also,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.950
because it remind you,
again, of how much Chaplin

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.560
borrowed from this movie
when he made Modern Times.

00:24:57.155 --> 00:24:59.370
Now there are many
imaginative effects here,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.325
but still, you see
how stable the camera

00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:04.190
is, how stationary it is?

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.630
The kinetic power of
the camera had not yet

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.255
been discovered, not because
it was undiscoverable,

00:25:14.255 --> 00:25:17.350
because the Americans had
discovered it a decade earlier,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.310
but because the
power of older forms

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.077
was inhibiting the
people making the movies.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.994
Again, in the
early days, you can

00:26:09.994 --> 00:26:11.410
imagine that some
of these effects

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.380
would have been very
dramatic-- the falling bodies.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.210
Still, watch what happens here.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:23.180
We've turned symbolic--
Moloch, the devil,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.260
the devil's henchman.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.810
That's what modern
industrial society is,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.660
a maw that will swallow us up.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.369
You see how weird
and disturbing it is.

00:26:45.369 --> 00:26:46.160
Thank you, Kristen.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.840
A serious, an interesting film,
but still in certain ways,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.950
I hope you could see
both deeply melodramatic,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.170
and the acting styles
are very broad.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.170
Where do they come from?

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:00.950
Theater.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.170
They're theatrical acting still.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.550
They haven't fully
adjusted despite the power

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.350
of these films, and in
intellectual and thematic ways,

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.690
they haven't fully adjusted to
the idea that they're movies.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:16.250
And the man who solved this
problem or the German director

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.510
who understood more
fully than the others

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.636
what it meant to make
a movie was FW Murnau.

00:27:21.636 --> 00:27:22.760
His dates are on the board.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.950
You could see he died
in his early 40s.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.880
It was a tragic death.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.520
He was just coming into his
own as a great, great director.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.590
He had emigrated to the United
States in the late '20s,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.190
and the film I've listed on
the board, Sunrise in 1927,

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.500
was made in the United States.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.230
And many people think it is the
greatest silent non-comedy made

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.430
in the United States.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.980
It's a bit
sentimental, but there

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.021
are brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant things in it.

00:27:47.021 --> 00:27:50.910
It's a very, very rich artifact.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.090
And then with the famous
documentary director,

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.230
Robert Flaherty,
his last film Tabu,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.200
which he co-directed
with Robert Flaherty,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.380
became a tremendous success.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.710
But he died in 1931 just
before the film was released,

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.410
just on the verge
of a kind of a claim

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.390
that perhaps no other director
in the world at that time had.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.950
It's tragic, a tragic story.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:21.320
The film in which we can see
Murnau freeing the camera

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.550
is the film called
Nosferatu made in 1922.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.210
And some of you will
perhaps recognize it

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:33.090
as the origin film for a
tremendous number of horror

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:33.610
movies.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.020
Many people would call it
the first horror movie.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.070
That may be an
exaggeration or inaccurate,

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.750
but it is among--
it is certainly

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.280
the most influential and
significant early horror film.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:50.680
It's based on the Dracula
story, and like Dracula itself,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.960
it tells a very
strange sort of story

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:59.580
about vampires who
survived for centuries

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.330
and then come into the world,
and by their little sort

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.660
of suggestive sexual bite
in the neck of a woman,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.130
transform the women
into vampires as well.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.800
And it's now a kind of
commonplace established idea

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:20.590
that this energy, that
the kind of Gothic fantasy

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.160
that is embodied in
the story of Dracula

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.330
and in so many similar ones,
has its origins in various forms

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.140
of sexual fantasy.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.570
And the Dracula figure, when
he kisses the woman's neck,

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.250
is symbolically engaged
in a sexual act.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.040
And the woman's resistance
but then her transformation

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.220
into a vampire is presumably
the woman's transformation

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.130
to sexual activeness
in some way.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.340
At least these are the kinds
of symbolic or underlying

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.310
associations that
many scholars bring

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.690
to bear when they talk
about why such stories were

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.510
so fascinating and so popular
at the end of the 19th century.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.340
So one thing to
remember about Nosferatu

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.430
is it is an
adaptation of a novel

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.380
already very widely known.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.240
And in fact, there were
copyright questions

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.662
about Nosferatu.

00:30:14.662 --> 00:30:19.290
The copyright owners from
the book sued the filmmakers,

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.570
and I'm not sure
what the outcome was.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.310
But the film did
survive in any case.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.490
So here are a couple of scenes.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.800
Here is the beginning
of Nosferatu.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.300
And the subject matter seems
to me not that interesting,

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.170
but again, my view is not
necessarily the only view.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.270
There are people who
love these films.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.450
I don't know why they do, but
I don't want to simply impose

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.840
my view on you.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.300
If you're interested
in this, or if you

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.750
share a love of horror
film-- one of my problems

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.220
is I don't like
horror films today,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.544
even though they've reached
a very sophisticated level.

00:30:55.544 --> 00:30:56.460
I think they're silly.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.970
I don't get them.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.739
So I'm not a good judge of
them, and my negative judgments,

00:31:01.739 --> 00:31:03.030
take them with a grain of salt.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:08.010
They're partly colored
by my own preoccupations.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.140
There are ways I could
defend my position,

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.960
but I don't feel I should
impose my views on you.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.420
I do think it's a silly
story, and it seems to me

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.490
that reality is complex
enough without sort

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.710
of inventing horrors
that hide underground

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.740
for thousands of years and
emerge with magical powers.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.570
The actual horrors
of reality seem to me

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.520
sufficient and not
adequately studied.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.070
So that's one of my objections
to these forms of fantasy.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.950
But in any case,
that's personal.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.770
But in any case, what you
can see in Nosferatu, even

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.310
people who are not as interested
in the subject matter,

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:45.770
they can see what a technically
innovative film it is.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.850
Watch this.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.016
Here's the beginning.

00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:51.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.120
In, fact freeze it already.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.440
Does this seem more
realistic to you?

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.300
Do you see already--
no fake sets?

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.850
We don't feel we're watching a
theatrical piece, that a camera

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.930
is filming a theater piece?

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.840
What's one of the
reasons for that?

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.480
The natural sunlight.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.160
That's natural sunlight.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.820
Go ahead.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.230
The texture of his
bedding also is a factor.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.740
And of course, the sunlight is
a crucial motif in the film,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.130
because Dracula
lives by darkness.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.620
And the film depends,
quite brilliantly,

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.810
on a series of juxtapositions
of light and dark,

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.660
of shadow and brightness.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.140
Now look at this.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.762
Freeze it, Kristen.

00:32:47.762 --> 00:32:48.720
Freeze it for a second.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.400
Look at this.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.520
We're really outside
in a real world.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.830
Look at these animals.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:57.470
And you can feel the film--
at first, we're disoriented.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.100
We don't even know why
are we looking here?

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.190
But the film's joy-- we can feel
almost the film's excitement

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.830
at showing us what the
real world looks like.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.580
I actually find this
visually and intellectually

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.190
much more exciting than
a ridiculous set in which

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:21.180
a symbolically dressed monster
staggers around in a way

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.530
that no one who ever
walked the earth moved.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:24.980
I find this much
more compelling.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.820
But what was
important at the time

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.690
was how liberating it was,
because what Murnau was showing

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.300
is look what the
camera can actually do.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.890
He's freeing the camera.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:35.410
Go ahead.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:50.860
OK.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.920
That's enough of this.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.950
Maybe I'll give you
one more quick scene.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.670
Do we have a separate clip?

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.554
Let's go to the other clip.

00:33:59.554 --> 00:34:01.470
Now here's something
from the end of the film.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.100
Can you freeze it a second?

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.830
I'll sort of briefly
set the [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.570
This guy is Dracula's
weird assistant,

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.610
and he's escaped from jail.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:16.730
I find the story idiotic,
ridiculous, totally unserious.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.150
But look at the
realism visually here.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.170
This is maybe the first time
that these narrow alleyways

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.550
were captured with
such precision.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.000
It's almost as if,
at least for me,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.590
the subject matter
is irrelevant,

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:33.550
and what the film is showing
about how it can render reality

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.736
is so exciting that it's as if
a new universe has opened up.

00:34:36.736 --> 00:34:38.360
And I must admit that
even though there

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.780
were American directors who
were working with a freed camera

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.380
long before this,
no one ever used

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.171
the camera outdoors more
effectively up to this time

00:34:47.171 --> 00:34:47.670
than Murnau.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.359
And I'll show you a
little more of this,

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:51.150
even though the plot
is stupid, because you

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.050
can see how realistic and
persuasive, compelling

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.568
the visual experience is.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.700
See the freedom of the
camera to shoot down,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.412
how that changes around you?

00:35:10.412 --> 00:35:11.620
The quickness of the editing.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.630
There he is up on
top of his roof.

00:35:28.612 --> 00:35:30.070
If you didn't know
the context, you

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.720
would see this as a form of
oppression and mistreatment.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.770
Why are they going
after this poor guy?

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.620
And I think that is an
implication of this,

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.774
even though he's
the source of evil.

00:35:40.774 --> 00:35:42.470
But look at the realism of this.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.060
Look at the texture of
the bricks, the sense

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.610
you have that this is a
real place, that he really

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.636
climbed down a roof.

00:35:50.636 --> 00:35:51.135
The movies.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.410
If the movies
don't do this, they

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.530
have to give us a sense of that
gross reality, which the movies

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.712
have the power to do.

00:36:00.712 --> 00:36:02.170
They have to have
very good reasons

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.649
for giving up that power.

00:36:04.649 --> 00:36:06.690
It's a very rare film that
can really give it up.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.160
Some animations can do it.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.410
But even surreal films,
even films that exaggerate

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.520
or that create alternative
worlds that are not

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:21.010
like our real worlds today
have the kind of kinetic camera

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.990
and sense of the textured
quality of the external world

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.540
that we get in those images.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.360
So Murnau was critical to us and
crucial to us for this reason,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.970
and his great masterpiece
is one of the two films

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.490
that I've asked you
to watch tonight.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.540
We're showing both Nosferatu
and The Last Laugh.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.320
Let's do it in the order
of The Last Laugh first.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.850
I think Nosferatu's a less
interesting film, but still

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.587
from a technical
standpoint, fascinating.

00:36:49.587 --> 00:36:51.670
And those of you who are
interested in the history

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.070
of horror films, you
should pay attention,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.330
because there's hardly a
frame in Nosferatu that

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:02.210
has not been alluded to or
echoed in later horror films.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.510
And it is the origins
of what is now

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:09.660
a dominant movie genre, both a
literary and a cinematic genre.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.640
So it's a very,
very important film.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.550
But The Last Laugh is
a true masterpiece,

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.770
and one of the reasons I think
it's such a remarkable film

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.950
is that it's freed
in some degree

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:25.730
from the pretentiousness,
the surreal pretentiousness

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.980
of expressionism.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.490
There are expressionist elements
in the film as you'll see.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.880
Very cleverly done.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.310
There's one immensely
grotesque and powerful moment

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.660
in which, for example,
there are a series--

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.560
we are given an image of
some gossiping women, who

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.470
are trading gossip about
the primary character.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:51.076
And we'll see how interestingly
Murnau handles that sequence.

00:37:51.076 --> 00:37:53.200
And there's an element of
distortion or grotesquery

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:53.977
in that.

00:37:53.977 --> 00:37:55.810
There are also elements
in the film, moments

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.810
in the film, brilliant
moments in the film where

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.420
what is shown externally is not
what's happening externally,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.530
but what is going on in the
mind of the primary character.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.300
In other words, it
carries the principle

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:11.000
of finding ways to create
a subjective camera even

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.080
further than any
previous film had done.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.360
There's one remarkable moment
in this film-- watch for it.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.230
It's very astonishing-- in which
the director of photography,

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:26.090
Karl Freund, was asked to
sort of figure this out.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.140
There's a moment when the
protagonist gets drunk.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.556
He's very disappointed about
something, and he gets drunk,

00:38:30.556 --> 00:38:31.830
and he staggers around.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.550
And they were trying to figure
out a way of dramatizing this.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.040
They played around
with the camera,

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.050
and they strapped the
camera to the actor's waist,

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.560
and when he staggered
around, the world you saw

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.580
was staggering too.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.610
And it created an
immensely powerful sort

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:51.100
of subjective experience
for the viewer.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.500
And there are a number of
other places in the film where

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.510
you can see that
what's being dramatized

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.730
is the inner life
of the characters.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:03.000
So there are expressionist
elements in the film,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.640
but it transcends expressionism.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.430
It becomes a film truly about
reality without distortion,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.020
and of course, its
basic subject is

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.670
what happens to
our old people when

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:15.130
they get too old to function.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.960
This is a theme I'm
beginning to find more

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.680
and more sympathetic as I age.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.570
But it's one of the
most powerful treatments

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.370
of this subject.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:25.860
And basically, the
story is about--

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.850
as you'll see-- it's about a
porter in a hotel whose job is

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.790
to help carry baggage in.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.240
But he's an immense
big man played

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.510
by one of the most famous
theater actors of the day, Emil

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.850
Jannings.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.170
And at a certain point in
the film, as you'll see,

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.530
he's demoted.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.410
He loses his job.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.750
They take his uniform away.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.050
His uniform is very
important to him.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:47.885
And they demote him.

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.510
He has to go and work
in the men's room

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.000
as a men's room attendant.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.640
So the film in a certain
way does several things.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.410
First, it shows us
what Murnau himself

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:03.840
came to call the unchanged
camera, the free camera.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.770
And over and over
again, you can see

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.180
how immensely innovative the
camera work in this film is.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.250
The very opening
scene of the film

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.120
is a tour de force
you might miss

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.550
because it happened so quickly.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:20.170
The camera follows a person down
an elevator, a glass elevator,

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.250
and then follows
it across the room.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.139
The camera was actually
mounted on a bicycle

00:40:25.139 --> 00:40:26.430
so they could move it that way.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.096
It happens so quickly
you might not even

00:40:28.096 --> 00:40:31.030
notice it, although filmmakers
were overwhelmed by it,

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.990
because he was doing
things with the camera

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.700
that no one else
had done before.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.380
And you'll see other
moments in the film

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:45.019
where his use of the camera
is complex and innovative.

00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:47.310
I've already talked a bit
about the themes in the film,

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.351
but let me continue this.

00:40:48.351 --> 00:40:51.730
So I've said in a way it's
a working class tragedy.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.120
And the very fact that
it's about an ordinary man,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.240
but it tries to treat him
with the kind of dignity

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.840
that in the classical times
kings and high born characters

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.200
would receive is
very significant

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.050
and is a powerful aspect
of the subject matter.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.600
What also develops
is a deep sense

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.400
of the character
of the protagonist.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.160
The way in which his identity
is connected to his job

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.990
and how when his job, and
especially his uniform,

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.060
which is the symbol
of his authority,

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:30.390
is taken away, how he's
unmanned, unhousled, undone,

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.520
incapable of functioning.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:38.365
So it's a very powerful,
socially aware movie.

00:41:38.365 --> 00:41:41.040
It dramatizes character with
a kind of subtlety that's

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.810
very rare in silent film.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.900
You really have a sense
of this man's character.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.358
It's quite a
brilliant performance,

00:41:46.358 --> 00:41:48.860
even though Jannings
was its theater actor,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.360
and there is something somewhat
broad about his performance,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.470
you can see him beginning
to adapt to the camera

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.930
and to the more nuanced
things that the camera can do.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.170
But even the parts
of his role that

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.840
are a little sort of
exaggerated make sense

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.920
because there's something
pretentious and pompous

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.070
about his character.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.650
One of the subtlest things
about the film, in fact,

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.030
is the way the character
has this complexity.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.870
A character for whom
the audience's sympathy

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:19.960
is constantly solicited
is also imperfect,

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.050
in some ways, an annoying
old man, not a nice person,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.250
selfish, proud of his
superiority to the other people

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.337
with whom he lives.

00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:30.170
One of the ways you
could see this operating

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.780
is the film really operates
in two different spaces--

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.870
the space of the great
hotel and the space

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.460
where the character
played by Jannings lives.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.790
He lives in a working class
ghetto, a working class

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.770
part of the city.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.610
And the two environments, the
hotel and the working class

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.760
part of the city,
are juxtaposed,

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.549
and we learn about each of
them by their juxtaposition.

00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:50.965
The working class
part of the city

00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:53.820
is interesting for a number of
reasons, but one of the best

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.470
is the pride he
takes in his uniform.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:59.290
He may be only a hotel porter,
But in his neighborhood,

00:42:59.290 --> 00:42:59.980
he's a big man.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.524
He's a big shot, and he's
very proud of himself.

00:43:02.524 --> 00:43:04.190
You can even see him
boring the children

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.970
and giving them
instructions and things.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.761
The most important
point I'm trying to make

00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:09.970
is that he's a complex
character that we learn

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:14.920
this without dialogue through
the genius of silent film,

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.450
because he's both
flawed and also

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.260
an object of sympathy
and affection.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.290
The film doesn't
simplify his character.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.870
He's a spiky, unpleasant
man in some ways,

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:29.340
but we also still feel
for him and recognize

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.900
how terrible his tragedy is.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.160
One of the most important
characteristics of the film

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.870
and the mark of what a
cinematic achievement it is

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:41.400
is that up until very close
to the very end of the film,

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:46.710
there is not a single
title card, not

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.660
a single use of words.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.890
In other words, the film
depends upon its visual power.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.890
And you understand even
complex things like the fact

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.210
that the character is
drunk, whether he's not

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:59.770
thinking straight, or that what
he's seeing is not reality,

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.520
but some distorted
version of reality.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.275
No title cords
explain this to you.

00:44:03.275 --> 00:44:07.290
The film has a fluency,
a visual eloquence

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.370
that's very remark-- that's
the mark of a movie maker.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.370
But there's an
interesting tip-off here.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.200
An interesting problem
here is presented,

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.480
and I'll end with this point.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.360
It has to do with the
ending of the film,

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.100
and I want you to think about
this as you reflect on the film

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.370
after you've watched it.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.220
I've described the
basic plot of the film,

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.710
and as you'll discover,
this catastrophe

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.660
that descends upon the
protagonist of the film

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.760
is reversed at the
end of the movie.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.470
And see, he wins a lottery,
and great good fortune

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.687
descends upon him.

00:44:40.687 --> 00:44:42.520
Don't be angry that
I've given you the plot.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.728
You can't talk about film
seriously without doing it,

00:44:44.728 --> 00:44:45.820
so don't be disappointed.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.990
I won't spoil movies
by doing real spoilers.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.650
If I think you
shouldn't know this

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:53.294
for the experience of the
film, I won't mention it.

00:44:53.294 --> 00:44:54.710
But don't be annoyed
if I do this,

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.580
because I need to explain
this stuff to you.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.510
So there's this reversal at the
end, but it's a fake reversal.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.744
You don't really believe it.

00:45:01.744 --> 00:45:02.660
It seems inconsistent.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.400
Why do you think it's there?

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.110
The film was such a downer.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.660
The original cut
was such a downer

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.080
that the people, the
producers paying for the film

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.940
said, no, no, no,
you've got to put

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.860
a happy ending on the movie.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.580
So Murnau and his
colleagues-- it

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.360
was a collaborative process--
the screenwriter, Carl Mayer,

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.040
and the director of
photography Carl [? Freund, ?]

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.350
as well as the actors
were all collaborating

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:27.720
in the making of the film.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.520
They said, OK, well,
what should we do?

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.940
So they tacked on
this happy ending.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.880
One of the things that marks the
happy ending is a title card,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.920
and the appearance
of the title card

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.790
is a confession
or a secret signal

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.570
to the real members of the
audience-- this film is over.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.320
Forget this crap that's
coming at the end.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.800
At least that's how
I want to read it.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.380
But what you should ask yourself
as you're watching the film

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.300
are two things.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.800
First-- not ask but
meditate on-- first

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.320
of all, this poor ending or this
ending that seems to reverse.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.010
The reason the ending is bad
is that the whole momentum

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.350
of the film leads toward
this catastrophe at the end,

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:04.660
and to reverse it
by an act of fortune

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.480
like that is to deny the social
and political implications

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.460
and psychological
implications of the story.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.490
It's a very unartistic
thing to do.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.990
It violates the
momentum of the text,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.867
of the trajectory
of the character.

00:46:18.867 --> 00:46:19.700
So it's a bad thing.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.450
But it is also an embodiment
of an enduring issue

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:28.020
in movie making, which is
the conflict between art

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.400
and commerce.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.250
Movies are commercial objects.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.910
This is hardly the only film
in the history of movies

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.640
to be distorted in this way.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.290
And in fact, that tension
is not always negative.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.560
Sometimes forcing directors
to sort of communicate

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.820
with their audiences is helpful.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.790
It isn't always the case that
these commercial imperatives

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.449
are negative, although
they often are.

00:46:48.449 --> 00:46:50.740
But this is one of those
classic instances that can you

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.970
think of other famous examples?

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.800
Orson Welles, the
American director,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.470
was often-- suffered
tremendously

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:00.970
from this kind of pressure,
because his films were thought

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.680
to be unwatchable,
and one of his films

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.220
was cut against his will, and
he lost control of his films.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.704
And he made very
many fewer films

00:47:09.704 --> 00:47:11.120
than he might have
made had he not

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.880
been thought of as a commercial
disaster by the Hollywood money

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.470
people.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.170
And there are many,
many other examples

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.900
of this in the
history of movies.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.650
One could say that this is
one of the originating moments

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.430
in which the conflict between
art and commerce in the movies

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:25.776
is dramatized for us.

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.150
But there's
something else I want

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.310
you to think about
as well as you're

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.393
thinking about the ending.

00:47:29.393 --> 00:47:31.640
What is the moment at
the end of the film that

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.320
really would end the film?

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.640
Because I think there is one.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.480
It's a visually very powerful
moment, but it's so bleak.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.900
It's so sad that you can
understand why the money

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.030
men wouldn't have liked it.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.460
So as you're watching
the film, think about all

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.910
of these matters,
but especially think

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.540
about the way in which
Murnau discovered

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.700
more fully than any
director up to his time

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.520
what we might call the
kinetic powers of the camera.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.830
He unchained the camera.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.940
He [? fliberated ?] the
camera, and German film

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.440
was-- world cinema, but
German film especially,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.280
was never the same after that.

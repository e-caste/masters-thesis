00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I didn't quite get a chance to
tell you a few things about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
photosystem II last time,
so I am going to go ahead and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
finish up with that now before
going onto the Cardiolite story.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Photosystem II shares quite a
lot in common with photosystem

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I, but there are a few major
differences.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Photosystem II is the first
link in the chain of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
photosynthesis.
It is really where all

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
photosynthesis starts out on
earth.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And, as such,
it is an extraordinarily

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
important enzyme,
this photosystem II.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But it is such a large and
complicated enzyme.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And it is also a membrane
enzyme.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As I mentioned last time,
these are difficult to isolate

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and purify and crystallize so
that you can study their

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
structures.
And it was only in the last

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
couple of years that photosystem
II was actually

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
crystallographically
characterized,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so there is really a lot of
very recent science that is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
relevant to today's presentation
on photosystem II.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
As you go through and read
about it, you are going to learn

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
about the molecules that harvest
the light, and you are going to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
learn about where the electron
goes and where the hole goes

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
when light is absorbed by this
amazing system.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Here is a close up of part of
the system called the reaction

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
center, for obvious reasons.
This where the reactions take

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
place that are so integral to
photosynthesis.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Namely we have,
up here at the top,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a manganese-containing cluster,
the structure of which is still

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a little bit ill-defined.
As you can imagine,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
with a macromolecule of this
size, it is difficult to say

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
exactly where just each and
every atom is in the structure.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
There are still some details of
the structure,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of the manganese cluster,
here, that are not known.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But, nonetheless,
this is where two water

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
molecules must be brought in and
coordinated and ultimately where

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
water, which is not a good
reducing agent,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
serves as a source of electrons
in this system.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And what happens is this
special pair of chlorophyll

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
molecules at the heart of the
reaction center absorbs a photon

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and goes into an excited state.
And the electron is able to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
travel down through a series of
pigment molecules,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and it gets down onto this
plastoquinone A.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And it is able to jump over
onto the plastoquinone B.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And plastoquinone B then can
dissociate from the reaction

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
center and carry that electron
onto the next link in the chain

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in photosynthesis.
And, at the same time,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the hole is stuck back over
here and ends up accepting an

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
electron by oxidation of a
reduced tyrosine moiety here.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
This tyrosine has a phenoxy
residue.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It is connected to the amino
acid polypeptide backbone of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this protein and it is
positioned right here between

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the manganese cluster and the
special pair,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
so that once the electron is
shuttled away down this redox

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
cascade pathway,
it is juxtaposed with this

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
reduced tyrosine,
which is getting its electrons

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
from the water that is
coordinated to the manganese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
complex.
And somehow those two water

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
molecules, after giving up their
four electrons,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
become O two.
And O two gas bubbles out,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and that is the source of the
oxygen that we breathe on this

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
planet.
So this is, needless to say,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
a very important enzyme to
understand.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And I won't have time to go
through an exploration of the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
structure today,
but I will lead you into it by

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
showing you this picture.
And in this picture,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
the sort of gray background
that is mapped out here on the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
outside represents this
polypeptide chain,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
all the amino acids that are
linked together to form the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
protein container of photosystem
II.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And you can see that it looks
like a dimeric structure where

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you have one reaction center
over here, here is a special

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
pair located over there.
And then all embedded

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
throughout this protein you find
many, many cofactors which are

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
like porphyrins,
but contain magnesium.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And there are these chlorophyll
units.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And then also,
shown in sort of an orange

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
color here, you see these long
straight molecules.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
These are polyenes.
These are carotenoid molecules,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
organic molecules that have
strings of double bonds adjacent

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to one other so that they can
conduct electricity and conduct

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
energy.
And this is a really key

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
feature of this --
-- because the point that is

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
being made here is that the
photosynthesis does not wait

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
until a photon actually comes in
and impinges right there on the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
special pair.
A photon can come in anywhere

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
on this big molecule or on these
light harvesting proteins shown

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
at top and at bottom that come
up and dock next to photosystem

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
II.
And these light harvesting

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
proteins are also just chalk
full of light absorbing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
chromophores,
chlorophylls,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and carotenoid molecules.
And, if a photon comes in and

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
excites one of these molecules
over here, the proton has a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
mechanism for transmitting the
energy over to the special pair,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
so that water can be oxidized
to O two.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It is really quite a tremendous
assembly of different kinds of

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
molecules to perform function.
And if you go on and take 5.03,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
for example,
and then 5.04,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
you will learn about the rules
that govern electron transfer

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
between molecules and also in
proteins.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Let's see.
Finally, on this subject,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I will show you,
here, a view of this reaction

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
center.
And this just a close-up to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
show you that these water
molecules indeed must get in

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
here.
There is also a calcium ion

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
present at this active site,
where the water molecules are

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
being oxidized and converted
into dioxygen.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And here is that tyrosine
residue shown in more detail.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
That is very important for the
hopping of the electron from

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
water to the tyrosine.
And then over here,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
after the hole has been
generated through excitation of

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the special pair of chlorophyll
molecules.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And so that brings me to the
end of my discussion of

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
six-metaloenzyme systems that
had quite a bit in common in

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
terms of the ligands that are
used to bind metals.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We talked about heme last time
and its employment of the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
porphyrin ligand in this regard.
But then, you should also

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
remember that sometimes you see
clusters packed into protein

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
molecules as cofactors.
We saw last time some Fe four-S

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
four clusters,
and here, a manganese cluster.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And so inorganic and organic
molecules are all working

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
together in a beautiful synergy
to enable photosynthesis.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And, having said that,
I would like to now go onto my

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
final topic, which has to do
with the role that metals can

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
play in medicine.
Last time was metals in

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
biology.
Now, we will talk about metals

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
in medicine.
And there are different ways

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that metals can be used in
medicine.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
For example,
there are molecules like

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
cisplatin that are used in
therapeutic methods for treating

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
cancer.
Alternatively,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
metals can be used in a
diagnostic manner.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And that is what I will be
talking about here today.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And so what I did for today was
I went directly to a couple of

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the Ph.D.
theses that are in the MIT

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
digital archive by two students
who worked in the Chemistry

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Department here and earned their
Ph.D.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
theses doing the chemistry of
technetium.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now, I like technetium for a
lot of reasons.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
One, it is a neighbor element
to molybdenum in the periodic

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
table.
Number two, it is named after

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
MIT, so that is wonderful.
Number three,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
technetium is unique as an
example, right in the center of

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
the periodic table,
as a manmade element.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And it has been known for quite
some time, and I am going to

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
tell you a little bit how
technetium chemistry has evolved

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
in the MIT Chemistry Department.
And so this first thesis is a

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
1983 thesis of a fellow by the
name of Mike Abrams,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
a very smart graduate student
who was given a very difficult

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
research problem indeed for his
Ph.D.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
thesis.
And that had to do with

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
preparing compounds directly
from the pertechnetate ion.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And pertechnetate is the ion
TcO four minus.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And, if you look through this,
you will see why Mike Abrams

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
needed to prepare compounds
directly from the pertechnetate

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
ion.
And it has to do with the idea

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that there is an isotope of
technetium.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
An isotope known as
technetium-99M,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
M for metastable,
that has a six hour half-life.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And, in that six hour time
window that is the half-life of

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
technetium-99M,
it is dropping from a nuclear

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
excited state into a nuclear
ground state.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And I will talk more about that
in a moment.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But as the nuclear excited
state relaxes to the ground

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
state, this nucleus emits a
single gamma photon at about

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
kiloelectron volts.
And so that single gamma

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
photon, high energy photon,
that comes out when this

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
nucleus decays from 99M to
regular technetium-99,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
which has a much longer
half-life on the order of 10^5

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
years, is what is useful in a
branch of medicine known as

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
nuclear medicine.
So radiologists will be

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
interested in this.
And, as you will see,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
cardiologists will be
interested in this as well.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And so, because of this,
gamma camera images can be

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
obtained at high-resolution to
image organs that have taken up

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
this radioisotope.
Let's point out also,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
here, that the chemical form of
technetium obtained from the

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
generator that creates it is the
pertechnetate ion,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
so all radiopharmaceuticals
have to be prepared from TcO

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
four minus because
that is what you get.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Molybdenum-99 is a product of
nuclear fission.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And so, when people are using
nuclear reactors to make energy,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
they are accumulating a lot of
molybdenum-99.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And molybdenum-99 is an
unstable isotope of molybdenum,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and so it is right to the left
of technetium on the periodic

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
table.
And molybdenum-99 itself

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
undergoes a beta decay,
in which a neutron turns into a

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
proton and electron.
And that beta decay converts

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
molybdenum-99 into this
metastable isotope of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
technetium.
So what happens is that every

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
morning at the hospital,
the molybdenum-99 has been

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
coated as MoO four onto
an alumina column and is

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
undergoing its own beta decay.
And when that is done,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
you now have pertechnetate on
the column.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And you can elute that in very
dilute solution,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
in isotonic saline solution.
You then have a very small

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
amount of time to do chemistry
with it before you put it in the

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
body.
Therefore, Mike Abrams,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and I will tell you about the
professors involved in this in a

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
little bit, was given the
problem of finding a way to take

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
an extremely dilute solution on
the order of 10^-9 molar

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
solution in saline and do a
quantitative reaction from

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
pertechnetate to make something
that would go and localize in an

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
organ that you want to image to
find out about the patient's

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
health.
That is a tall order,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
but that didn't stop them from
looking into this.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
In fact, I included this page
in part, because Mike Abrams has

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
some nice statements,
here.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He says the reason we carried
out this research was to gain a

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
better understanding of what
kinds of coordination complexes

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
can be prepared directly from
TcO four minus with

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the hope that such information
might lead to the development of

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
new radiopharmaceutical agents
and/or to a better understanding

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of the agents already in
clinical use.

00:13:24.918 --> 00:33:03.000
This thesis was written in

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Well, let me not get ahead of
myself here.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And let me just show you here
one of the first technetium

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
complexes that Mike Abrams was
able to prepare.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And this is a technetium
hexacis thyourea species.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
You will see that he has this
pertechnetate and was able to

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
convert it into molecules that
are octahedral at technetium.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And, in fact,
most of the applications of

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
technetium in nuclear medicine
do involve octahedral

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
six-coordinate technetium,
--

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
-- harkening back to what we
can understand based on the

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
efforts and achievements of
Alfred Werner.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Here is the octahedron,
pretty soon,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
going to go into a patient's
body.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Here he has chosen to use
sulfur donor ligands,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
these thiourea ligands in
making this.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And he also made molecules in
which phosphines and phosphites

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
were able to bind to technetium.
And later, as you will see,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
he also did work with
isocyanides.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
This is 90 degrees rotated.
Basically, the reason I am

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
showing you this is that this is
a nuclear magnetic resonance

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
spectrum of a technetium-99
compound.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Let me just explain that
initially, when doing these

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
studies, Mike Abrams was working
mostly with technetium-99 that

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
has the real long half-life so
you can actually make molecules

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
on a scale sufficient for
isolation and purification.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
But then those methods would be
translated to working with the

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
99M isotope.
And the difference between 99

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and 99M, has to do with the spin
of the nucleus.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We have talked about electron
spin.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Well, different nuclei have
themselves the property of spin.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And technetium-99 has a spin
one-half nuclear spin.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And then when it decays from
99M to 99, the 99 isotope has a

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
spin nine-halves,
actually.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And that is the lower energy
state that gives rise to this

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
gamma photon emission.
And so, in the nuclear magnetic

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
resonance spectrum,
observing the phosphorus 31

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
nuclei that are connected to
this hexakisphosphate of

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
technetium 1,
you see that there end up being

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
ten lines.
And that is because of the spin

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
nine-halves ground state of the
technetium-99 nucleus.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
You will see that back in the
`80s, we were looking at

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
technetium-coupled phosphorus
NMR spectra, as well as,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
you saw X-ray crystallography a
moment ago.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
This was real nice work.
And let's see what I have here.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
After Mike had successfully
synthesized some of these

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
complexes they started
wondering, well,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
can we image organs with these.
The idea was that

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
radiopharmaceuticals that had
been in use prior to this time

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
did not really have ligands on
the metal.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
It was sort of the case that
they would take the metal in

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
whatever form they got it off a
generator and just inject it

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
directly into the patient.
And, in that case,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
you don't have an ability to
tune the properties of the metal

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
to have it localize specifically
at organs that you might want to

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
image.
And so they thought we are

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
coordination chemists.
Let's put ligands on there,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and you can use different
ligands.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And then, the molecule will go
to different parts of the body

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
specifically.
And, when we find the right

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
ligand, we will be able to do
something useful,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
like image the heart.
And so here,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
they had an anesthetized dog
that they had injected with a

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
solution of one of these
technetium complexes.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
This was a hexakis isobutyl
isocyanide technetium-99M.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And they were able to show that
this stuff forms quantitatively,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
even at the tracer levels that
they are using to 10^-9 molar.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Very dilute solutions.
And so you don't actually get

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
much radioactivity put into you,
but because of the high energy

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
nature of the gamma photons that
come out, you can easily image

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
them with a gamma camera and you
can reconstruct the position

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
from which that radiation is
originating.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
That is what allows you to
image an organ.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And so here is a little
schematic of the ribcage of a

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
dog.
And you can see that he is

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
telling us where the liver is.
And then you are supposed to be

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
able to see kind of a doughnut,
which is the myocardium of the

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
heart here.
And you see it lighting up real

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
nice, right here.
So right away,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
with one of the first complexes
that they made,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
they found that this stuff goes
shortly after injection and

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
localizes in the heart and gives
you a pretty nice image of the

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
heart.
And there are different

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
viewpoints that you can take
when you image the heart using

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
methods like this,
but this was already pretty

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
exciting that one of the first
systems they made,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
these t-butyl groups on it,
were very nice imaging agents

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
for a dog.
And then the basis for the

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
nuclear cardiology application
of this chemistry is that if a

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
person has had a heart attack or
is at-risk to suffer a heart

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
attack, has some heart disease,
then what happens is you look

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
at the heart and it doesn't
become very well-perfused with

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
blood all the way around,
as it should in a normal

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
healthy heart.
And so, if there is infarcted

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
tissue, you see an image like
this, where part of the doughnut

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
is not lighting up.
And that means that part of the

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
heart is not getting suffused
with blood.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And so this kind of diagnostic
test is called myocardial

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
perfusion imaging,
because you are looking at how

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
the heart is taking up blood in
all of its different parts

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
because you can look at
different angles of view.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And one also tends to do this
when the subject is at rest

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
versus when the subject has been
stressed.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
So you will hear the term
stress test associated with this

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
type of image.
And so this is really the first

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
complex that Mike Abrams made
that they were actually testing

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
in animals.
Here was an infarcted dog

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
heart.
You see that there is blood not

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
getting to this part of the
heart, up here.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And this image was to be
compared with an image made

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
using a different imaging agent
which was the state of the art

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
at the time, here,
with just the first one.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And there were so many choices
you could make of what ligand to

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
put on this metal.
And the first one already works

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
better than thallium-201 that is
inserted just as an aqueous

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
solution.
So thallium-201 is also a

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
popular isotope for applications
in nuclear medicine,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
but with technetium,
now, you have the ability to

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
make coordination compounds
where the ligands are very

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
tightly bonded to the metal
center.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And then you can attach other
residues to this system by

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
virtue of how you build the
ligands.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
That was really pretty amazing.
And then a few years later,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
also in the research group of
Alan Davison,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Professor of Chemistry at MIT,
comes along one James Frederick

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Carnegie.
And what he decided to do for

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
his thesis work was to go ahead
and actually make molecules like

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
the ones that Mike Abrams made,
but to look at many different

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
varieties with different
peripheral substituents because

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
there are certain organic
functional groups that will be

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
metabolized and chopped up by
enzymes in the body.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
These include ester groups,
for example.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
You can also attach to these
isocyanide ligands things that

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
look like little proteins.
And you can see,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
then, how those react to being
injected.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And so his goal here was really
to make something practical that

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
would be useful as a
radiopharmaceutical for imaging

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
organs.
And his discussion begins by

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
just talking about the different
groups that he was going to

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
append to the surface of his
coordination complex.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And then, here is a little
synthesis slide from his thesis.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Mike Abram's thesis,
the first one I showed you,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
was actually typed up by hand
on a typewriter.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
But Jim Carnegie's thesis was
prepared, he tells me,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
I was talking to him last night
about this, using a very

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
primitive word processor.
One of the first-generation

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
word processors.
Anyway, that is a little bit

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
beside the point.
You just don't see as many nice

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
graphics in these theses as you
do nowadays, but you do see a

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
lot of beautiful chemistry.
Here is an isocyanide ligand.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Look.
We have talked a lot about

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
carbon monoxide in this class as
a ligand in its behavior to

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
transition metals.
And so if you just change the

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
oxygen of carbon monoxide into a
nitrogen, then you can have a

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
substituent stuck to it.
Here is an example of an

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
isocyanide ligand where the
metal is going to attach to the

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
carbon.
And then, Carnegie decided to

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
put other groups out here.
Here, he has a carboethoxy

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
residue.
And the idea was that enzymes

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
called esterases in the body can
clip off and metabolize the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
carboethoxy residue.
And what that will do is it

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
will affect the way that the
technetium is bio-distributed in

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the body.
It will affect the kinetics of

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
how long the technetium takes to
accumulate in an organ and how

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
long it takes to then run out of
that organ.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And also, he looked at examples
that have organic amide

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
functional groups,
all connected to the

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
isocyanide.
His thesis work was all about

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
looking at different
isocyanides, six of them on

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
technetium in the +1 oxidation
state.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
It is d^6 low-spin octahedral
diamagnetic systems.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
It talks here about the
radioactivity.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
It talks a little bit about the
technetium generator issue.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
It mentions that he is doing a
lot of this work in

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
collaboration over at Harvard
Medical School.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
They had a lab over there where
they were cleared to use 99M.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
The 99 work was done here,
at MIT.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
And this was because of the
collaboration that I will tell

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
you about shortly.
Here is one that I won't bother

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
to turn over.
But this actually a pretty

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
important slide.
You will get this pdf file from

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
our website, but you will see
that he is taking pertechnetate

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
and saline.
The key feature,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
here, is that this synthesis is
quantitative at these very low

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
concentrations that are what
used for nuclear medicine.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Now, I showed you that Mike
Abrams imaged part of a dog.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And as they progressed toward
doing human studies,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
they also imaged the rabbit.
And in these early tests,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
you know, you have these
chemistry Ph.D.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
students who don't really know
which organ is which in a bunny.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
They had to get a diagram like
this, out so they would have a

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
map, so that when they started
shooting these molecules into

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
the bunny they would know which
organ they were seeing light up

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
by the gamma camera.
And this does not hurt the

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
bunny.
The bunny is anesthetized and

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
does not know,
so this is a perfectly nice

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
thing to do.
And this one,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I think the bunny is oriented
this way, here is the liver.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And resting atop the liver on
the diaphragm is the heart of

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
the bunny right here.
He has a lot of different

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
images.
These, in the digital thesis

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
archive, are a little bit fuzzy.
If you want to see better

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
images, you might want to refer
directly to the thesis.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
But you will see that what he
is doing here is he is looking

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
as a function of time after
injection, just the intensity of

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
the gamma counts from the liver,
from the kidney.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Notice the heart starts out
real high, and then it clears as

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
the blood moves on into the
kidney and the liver.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And so you can actually take
these images as a function of

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
time and see where the
technetium is going in this

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
living bunny.
And I thought I would mention

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
that.
But then, I thought I would

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
also show you this picture.
I have seen this in the real

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
hard copy thesis,
and it looks much better in

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
terms of organs lighting up and
so forth.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
It is very fuzzy in this image
from Carnegie's Ph.D.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
thesis.
This, in fact,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
is Professor Alan Davison,
who was himself the first test

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
subject for his technetium
radiopharmaceutical.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
He just couldn't wait to have
this stuff shot into him,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
so he could see what his organs
looked like when imaged with a

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
gamma camera.
That is Professor Davison,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
first human test subject on his
own chemistry.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
That was pretty remarkable.
Let me tell you just a little

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
bit more about Alan Davison.
You can go and read about him

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
at the MIT website,
but this is Professor Davison.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
He is a colleague of mine in
inorganic chemistry,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
here at MIT.
He became an emeritus faculty

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
member this past summer,
but his research career spanned

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
40 years here at MIT.
He came in 1964.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And he did research in a lot of
different areas of inorganic

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
chemistry, and did not get into
technetium until 1980 because he

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
struck up a collaboration with
the fellow at Harvard Medical

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
School, who I will show you
next.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
He is a Welshman.
He got his Ph.D.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
with the Nobel Laureate
Geoffrey Wilkinson at Imperial

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
College, London,
after Jeff Wilkinson was denied

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
tenure by Harvard,
after which he got his Nobel

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Prize.
They did not make a very good

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
choice, there.
But, in any event,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Professor Davison learned and
became one of the top inorganic

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
and organometallic chemists of
his generation.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And, in fact,
he is now a Fellow of the Royal

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Society, which is quite a
special distinction.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I went over there for the
ceremony in London when he was

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
being inducted into the Royal
Society.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
And they pull out the book that
is signed by all the new

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
inductees into the Royal
Society.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
And one of the early signatures
in the book is that of Isaac

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Newton.
So he signed the same book as

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Isaac Newton.
You have to make sure your hand

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
does not tremble and blot the
page.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
It would be a big problem.
They actually go ahead and

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
teach them how to sign the book
and practice in advance because

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
they use a quill pen dipped into
ink, just the way Isaac Newton

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
did it.
And this coming spring,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Professor Davison is going to
Atlanta, as many of us chemists

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
are, for the American Chemical
Society meeting there.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
But he is going for a special
reason.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
He is winning the American
Chemical Society Award for

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Creative Invention,
which is a very prestigious

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
award.
And I believe he is the first

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
from our department ever to win
the Award for Creative

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Invention.
And that can go to a person in

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
any area of chemistry,
in fact.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
That is a really nice thing.
And Professor Davison was a

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
great mentor of both
undergraduate and graduate

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
students here at MIT over the
years.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And next let me show you that
it takes not one Welshman,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
but two, to make a drug.
And here is the other one,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Alan Jones, a very good
personal friend of Alan Davison.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
He and Alan got together in the
early `80s to see if they might

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
not be able to bring inorganic
chemistry and coordination

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
chemistry to nuclear medicine in
order to develop a diagnostic

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
imaging agent.
They got together,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
and their research was
extremely successful.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And they have done research in
other areas, too,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
together over the years.
And their students go back and

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
forth between the labs here and
Building 6 at MIT and over at

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Harvard Medical School to do the
different kinds of studies that

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
they do.
It turns out that his

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
chemistry, making these
six-coordinate complexes of

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
technetium-1,
has led to the development of

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Cardiolite.
This now is called Sestamibi.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
That is an abbreviation for
this compound that has six of

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
these isocyanide ligands on
technetium.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
When you see Sestamibi,
you will know what molecule

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
that is.
It is the one that actually

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
became commercial and was
approved by the FDA in

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
after extensive critical trials.
I will show you the structure

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
in a moment, but it is a
variation on the t-butyl,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
where one of the methyl groups
is replaced with a methoxy

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
group.
It is a methyl-ether species.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And Cardiolite was originally
manufactured and brought into

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
being by DuPont Merck.
And they sold it later to

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Bristol-Meyers Squibb.
And so you will see that

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Bristol-Meyers Squibb has a
section devoted to medical

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
imaging.
And this drug that was the

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
brainchild of Davison and Jones
is currently the most widely

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
used diagnostic imaging agent
for looking at myocardial

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
perfusion.
It is used in heart imaging

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
tests all around the world,
every day, so it is a very

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
important molecule contributing
to the health and welfare of

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
people all over the world.
And what you will see is there

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
are here descriptions of the
stress tests that people take.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Let's see.
Cardiolite imaging guide.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
You have education programs.
Let's just check out the

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
imaging guide for a moment.
These companies have pretty

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
good graphics on their websites.
And remember the doughnut I was

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
showing you, there it is right
here.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
There are different ways to
look at the heart using

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Cardiolite to see if the blood
is perfusing the heart properly.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
That might be the short axis.
You can view the scan images.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
This is how a normal healthy
heart will differ when it has

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
been stressed after exercise or
at rest.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
That is why they call these
stress tests.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
You are seeing how the blood is
distributed in the heart using

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
the property of the radionuclide
technetium-99M.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
There is one.
That is a different one.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I am not going to spend too
much time on this,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
but I am giving you the link to
this website so you can go and

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
look at how people actually use
clinically technetium Sestamibi

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
to image the heart.
I want to show you just a few

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
other things here,
one of which is that,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
as you may be aware,
the same molecule can have

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
different names if it is used
for different purposes.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Cardiolite is one of the names
given to Sestamibi,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
but another name given to
Sestamibi, here it is,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
is Miraluma.
And Miraluma,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
it turns out,
is really quite useful at

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
detecting breast cancer when
breast lesions are not readily

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
visible using mammography or
ultrasound.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
If you go to this website and
look at the information for

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
healthcare professionals,
as you all are sitting here,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
you will be able to see breast
tumors that are detected very

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
nicely using Sestamibi that were
missed using ultrasound or

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
mammography.
And you might like this.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
If you try to go into that
information, you're first

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
confronted with a test.
And you have to pass the test

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
and know that the risk of breast
cancer increases with age.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
If you get that right,
then you can go on and actually

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
look at the images that are made
using this drug.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Now, I also give you a link
here to the Cardiolite story

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
that is a nice article written
in the MIT Undergraduate

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Research Journal about
Professors Davison and Jones,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
their students,
and the creation of this

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
clinical tool.
You can go there and read that.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
And it has some more
information.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And then, finally,
I do give you a link to

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Sestamibi.
You will probably be appalled

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
at the way this website draws
the isocyanide complex of

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
technetium.
We know very well that that is

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
a linear bond angle at those
carbon atoms,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
not bent like that,
so that is not a very good

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
representation in terms of
structural fidelity.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
But if you want to know which
isocyanide is used in vivo for

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
imaging organs,
it is this one with the methoxy

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
group, instead of one of the
methyl groups of the t-butyl

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
group.
It is very similar to the

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
original one that Mike Abrams
made first back in 1983 because

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
they already had t-butyl
isocyanide around from other

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
things.
It is a really remarkable

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
story, a fantastic story.
And having told it to you,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I am now going to have to do
something that I very much

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
regret.
Now you can go on and sample

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
all the other exciting chemistry
subjects at MIT in your future.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
I hope to interact with many of
you again in that context.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And I wish you good luck.
I know that you all will do

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
fantastic things.
Having said that,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I am going to have to close the
book on this semester.

00:36:15.429 --> 00:36:18.000

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.760
What's the fuel consumption of a car? Say,
on the highway moving at highway speeds? We

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.100
can look it up, but can we understand those
numbers? Can we predict them from our knowledge

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.619
of science and engineering? That's what we're
gonna do in this video.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.859
This video is part of the problem solving
video series.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.460
Problem-solving skills, in combination with
an understanding of the natural and human-made

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.659
world, are critical to the design and optimization
of systems and processes.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:38.399
Hi, my name is Sanjoy Mahajan, and I'm a professor
of Applied Science and Engineering at Olin

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.899
College. And I excel at streetfighting mathematics.
Before watching this video, you should be

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.359
familiar with free body diagrams and dimensional
analysis.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.370
After watching this video, you will be able
to: Model drag to predict terminal velocities;

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.370
and Determine the fuel efficiency of a car.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.330
Fuel is consumed in fighting drag, on the
highway at least. What's the force of drag

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.770
on a car? That's fluid mechanics. We could
try the hard wayâ€”solving the Navier-Stokes,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.430
the equations of fluid mechanics.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.690
Now after 10 years of learning mathematics,
you'll discover this is a really hard problem.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.240
You can only solve it analytically in certain
special cases like a sphere moving at really

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.590
slow speeds and a car is not one of those
special cases; certainly not a car moving

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.430
at any reasonable speed. So we need another
way.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.990
By applying approximations artfully, we're
gonna find the drag force and the fuel consumption

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.910
of a car with a simple experiment and some
scientific and engineering reasoning.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.800
First, we need to model drag. To do this,
we're gonna figure out how the drag force

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.650
depends on the quantities that control it.
Drag force F depends on the density of the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.240
air, to some power which we don't know yet,
times the speed of the car moving through

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.250
the air, to some power we don't know yet.
It depends on how big the car is, which we'll

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.220
represent by the area; traditionally, the
cross- sectional area, to some power. And

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.190
it also can depend on the viscosity here,
the kinematic viscosity of the air to some

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.560
power. And what those powers are, we don't
yet know. To figure them out, let's do an

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.880
experiment.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.000
For the experiment, we make two cones. First,
by making a large circle and cutting out a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.480
quarter of it. The large circle has a radius
of seven centimeters. And the small three-quarter

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.800
circle has half the radius. Cut them out and
then tape this edge to that edge and this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.950
edge to that edge in order to make the 2 cones.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.850
Next we're gonna race them, the big cone vs.
the small cone. But first, make a prediction.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.680
The question is: what is the ratio of fall
speeds of the big cone and the small cone

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.959
approximately? Is the big cone roughly twice
as fast, is the small cone twice as fast,

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.200
or do they fall at roughly the same speed?
Pause the video and make your best guess.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.200
You may want to try the experiment yourself.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.300
The experimental result is that they both
fall at roughly the same speed. Now what does

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.870
that mean for the exponents in the drag force?
To decide, use a free body diagram. Here is

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.430
a free body diagram of a cone as it falls.
What are the forces on the cone? Pause and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.430
fill in the diagram.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.020
There is drag and gravity. Because the cones
are falling at their terminal speed, in other

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.709
words at the constant velocity that they reach
pretty quickly, the drag must equal the force

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.160
due to gravity.
So the drag force can easily be measured just

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.910
by sticking the cones on a scale. We don't
actually have to stick the cones on a scale

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.709
because we know what their relative weights
are and that's what we're gonna use to figure

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.819
out one of the exponents.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.090
Knowing that the drag equals the force due
to gravity, let's compare the drag forces,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.459
which are the factors on the right side, of
the small and large cones. The large cone

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.319
was made out of a paper circle with twice
the radius so it has four times the area,

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.960
four times the mass, and four times the force
due to gravity. Therefore, four times the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.960
drag force.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.379
Now let's look at the causes one by one. This
density here is the density of the air and

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.340
both cones feel the same air so there's no
difference here, so that's times one no matter

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.110
the exponent. Now, what about the speed? The
speeds were the same; that was the result

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.979
of our experiment, so no matter what the exponent
here, the speed contributes to the effect

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.960
by a factor of one; in other words, nothing.
Now the area. This is traditionally the cross-sectional

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.330
area. The big cone has four times the cross-sectional
area of the small cone so this area factor

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.330
is times four and raised to the unknown exponent.
And here, the kinematic viscosity, that's

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.919
the kinematic viscosity of air and both cones
feel the same kinematic viscosity. Therefore,

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.520
that contributes a factor of one just like
the density does.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.270
So now we know what the question mark here
has to be. The question mark here must be

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.270
one so that this four to the question mark
is equal to this four. And so does this one.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.169
Now that we have found one exponent, we can
find the remaining three using dimensional

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.308
analysis.

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:51.539
We make sure that the exponents chosen on
the right side produce dimensions of force,

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.729
which are the dimensions on the left side.
A force has dimensions of mass, length per

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.740
time squared, that's mass times acceleration.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.559
Density has dimensions of mass per length
cubed, raised to this unknown exponent. Velocity

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:13.689
has dimensions of length per time, raised
to this unknown exponent. Area has dimensions

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:19.409
of length squared, raised to the power 1,
we've already figured that out. And kinematic

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:24.529
viscosity; now, that's the regular viscosity
divided by the density. It has dimensions

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:31.439
of length squared per time raised to this
unknown exponent

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:36.689
Now let's solve for these unknown exponents
one at a time. Looking first at the mass,

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:42.039
there is mass here and mass here on the left
side, but there is no other mass. So the only

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:46.529
way to get the mass to work out is to make
this exponent one.

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:52.719
Now, what do we have left? We have to make
sure the lengths and times work out and we

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:57.719
have two unknowns, this exponent and this
exponent.

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:02.300
Let's see how many more lengths we need, given
what we already have. We have mass worked

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.129
out, we have two lengths here over three lengths
so we have mass per length. So we have length

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.619
to the minus one so far.

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:16.949
And what about time? Well, we have no times
yet except in these question marks so we need

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:22.279
to get two more times on the bottom two more
lengths on the top. So we need to multiply

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:27.930
by length squared over time squared, and the
only way to do that is to make this exponent

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.520
a two... and this exponent here a zero.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.819
You can pause the video and go ahead and try
other combinations of exponents. You'll find

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:43.819
that none of them will get both length and
time correct.

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:52.279
So now we have all the exponents, we can actually
enter that into our force formula. Drag force

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:58.659
is proportional to density to the first power,
speed squared, area to the first power we

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:04.399
got from our home experiment and viscosity
here to the zeroth power.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:09.649
Now let's test our formula with a second demonstration
and see if it predicts this new situation.

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:15.279
We're gonna race four small cones stacked
on top of each other. One, two, three, four.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:19.689
So we stack them to make one small cone that
is four times the mass of the other small

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:21.830
cone. Next we're going to race them.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:28.779
But first, what's the drag force ratio between
the small cone and 4 small cones stacked together.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:35.169
Pause the video and use the formula to make
a prediction.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.419
The four cones weigh four times as much as
one cone so that's times four on the left

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:46.560
side. What about the right side? Again, both
contestants feel the same air density. The

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.250
velocity ratio, that's what we're trying to
figure out, and let's see what all the other

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.519
pieces are. The area; well here in this case,
the stack of four has the same cross- sectional

00:08:55.519 --> 00:09:01.399
area as the one cone so that's just one. And
the viscosity doesn't matter. So, this factor

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:07.100
of four on the left side has to be produced
by the v squared; in other words, the v goes

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.810
up by a factor of two so that when it's squared,
you get a factor of four. That means the correct

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.779
answer should be two to one.

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:21.779
Now, let's test our prediction with a demonstration
to check whether nature behaves as we predict.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:28.100
It looks like our prediction was correct!
Now we feel pretty confident that we can use

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:35.100
this formula to try to figure out the fuel
consumption of a car.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.180
Let's clean up our formula here just a bit
and erase the viscosity since it comes in

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.899
with a zero exponent so it doesn't matter.
And this is our drag formula, which we're

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:49.769
gonna use to estimate the fuel consumption
of a car on the highway.

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:53.920
Fuel efficiency is measured as the distance
that that the car travels on one gallon or

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.000
liter of gasoline.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.139
So it depends on how much energy you can get
out of a gallon of gasoline divided by the

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:06.449
drag force, which is the formula we've just
found.

00:10:06.449 --> 00:10:13.389
So let's put in some numbers. What's the energy
from a gallon of gasoline? A gallon is roughly

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:20.329
4 liters. And gasoline is roughly like water
so, there are 1,000g/liter.

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:25.220
How much energy do you get out of each gram
of gasoline? Gasoline is like fat and from

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.639
the side of a butter packet, you can read
that 100 kilocalories, 10 to the 2 kilocalories

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:33.509
come from 11 grams of butter.

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:38.170
But now we want to convert kilocalories to
some reasonable metric unit. So that's four

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:45.170
joules/calorie or four kilojoules per kilocalorie.
And that all divided by the drag force so

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.470
let's put in those terms one by one.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:56.660
First the density here, one kilogram per meter
cubed is the density of air roughly. Now v

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:03.060
for highway speeds. Say 100 kilometers an
hour, 65 miles an hour. That's roughly 30

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.329
meters per second. Don't forget to square
it. And then the area of a car. Well, it's

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:15.329
about... two meters wide by 1.5 meters high.
Now we have to work all the numbers, but before

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:23.550
you do that, pause the video to check that
the dimensions all cancel appropriately.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:32.550
You should have found that the result has
units of meters, which is good! But how many?

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.959
A quick numerical approximation will tell
you that you get 50 kilometers, which is 30

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:44.959
miles roughly. The fuel efficiency of a car
on the highway is about 30 miles per gallon;

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:52.129
or 50 kilometers per gallon. In typical European
Union units, that's eight liters per hundred

00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:59.319
kilometers.To Review With our approximation
methods, we've come to pretty reasonable numbers

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:05.519
for the fuel efficiency of a car, without
having to solve any of the complicated equations

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:10.910
of fluid mechanics. Instead, we used one simple
home experiment, dropping the cones, and the

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:17.699
powerful principle of dimensional analysis.
From that, we were able to find all the exponents

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:23.579
here, in the relationship between drag and
density, speed, and cross-sectional area.

00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:28.560
So the moral of this is that there is an art
to approximations, and reasoning tools such

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.949
as dimensional analysis, they give you an
understanding of how systems behave without

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:38.449
having to solve every single last bit of the
detailed mathematics. This understanding allows

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:44.529
us to redesign the world.

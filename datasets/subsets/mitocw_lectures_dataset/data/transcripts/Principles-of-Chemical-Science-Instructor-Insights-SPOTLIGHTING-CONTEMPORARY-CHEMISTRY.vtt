CATHERINE DRENNAN: For 5.111,
we created this video series,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.600
and we called it, Behind
the Scenes at MIT.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.850
And there are two
kinds of videos.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.770
One where undergrads,
graduate students, post-docs,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.650
or another faculty
member are talking

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.740
about how the basic chemical
principles we're learning

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.740
about in the class are used
in their laboratory or by them

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.600
and how those chemical
principles will

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.040
make the world a better place.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.970
DARCY WANGER: My
name is Darcy Wanger,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.890
and I work as a graduate student
in the Bawendi lab at MIT.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.729
I work with quantum
dots in my research.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.850
Quantum dots are really,
really tiny particles

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.260
of a semiconductor.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.560
People in our lab are working
to make quantum dots bind

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.280
to a tumor.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.590
So when a doctor goes
in to remove a tumor,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.140
they can see, just
shining a UV light on it,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.580
and see whether
it's all gone when

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.660
they've taken out the tumor.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.440
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
It was interesting

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.940
because I talked to
some of the students

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.010
in the class about their sort
of perceptions of things.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.870
And then, after they
had watched the videos,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.160
sort of what they thought.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.980
And a lot of students actually
said, I was wondering.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.930
You're learning
this, and it's good,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.790
it builds character
to learn something

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.670
that could be
challenging but wondered,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.881
am I ever going to
use this for anything?

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.380
And then they started watching
these videos and seeing this,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.720
and they're like, oh, yes.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.160
This is used all the time.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.290
It could be used in my
undergraduate research.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.150
People are doing this.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.220
This is a subject that
people are actively

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.690
learning new things.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.330
And I feel like this is a
question for a lot of intro

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.310
classes, because you have
these thick textbooks

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.470
and you sort of
feel like everything

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.230
that could have been learned,
it seems like it's all there.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.970
Like volume 2.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.660
There are three laws
of thermodynamics.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.210
Are people trying to
find a fourth law?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.340
What is someone who do
chemistry research-- what

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.960
are they actually doing?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.890
Discovering?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.530
No, we know what the
electrons are already.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.020
And so this gave people
a sense of what people

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.820
were using chemistry for now.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.650
What were those
current questions.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.110
And when I was a high
school teacher originally,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.550
that was really what I wanted.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.780
What are people doing now?

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.010
What are the key questions?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.400
If I was studying chemistry,
what would I be doing?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.560
And I want to help
create this material

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.970
so other people can see that.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.300
Because for some people,
if you tell them it's hard

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.520
and it's a challenge to
learn, they'll just learn it.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.830
And if they don't use it--
it could be like Latin,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.050
it builds character, it's
fine, it's a dead language

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.670
but OK, I'm going
to get in there.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.710
But then for other
people, they really

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.657
want to know that this
is going to be useful.

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:23.490
And if they're going
to really invest in it,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.500
they want to know
that it's important

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.470
and they can do things.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.850
And MIT students and I think
so many people out there

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.450
want to make the
world a better place.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.500
There are a lot of really
wonderful human beings.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.150
And they need the
tools, and they

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.114
want to do something
that's important.

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:39.780
So I want to create
those tools for them

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.390
to learn this so that they
can apply it and do something

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.650
and they can see the
power of chemistry.

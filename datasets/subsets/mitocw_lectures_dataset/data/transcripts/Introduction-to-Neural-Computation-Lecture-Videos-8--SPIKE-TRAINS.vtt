WEBVTT

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.070
MICHALE FEE: OK, good morning.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.280
So far in class, we
have been developing

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.400
an equivalent circuit
model of a neuron,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.190
and we have extended that model
to understanding how action

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.570
potentials are generated.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.610
And, more recently,
we extended the model

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.000
to understanding the propagation
of signals in dendrites.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.620
So today we are
going to consider

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.740
how we can record activity,
record electrical signals

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.010
related to neural
activity in the brain,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.250
and we're going to
understand a little bit

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.040
about how we can, in particular,
record extracellular signals.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.830
So that will be the
focus of today's lecture.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.720
So, so far in
class, we have been

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.400
analyzing measurements of
electrical signals recorded

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.760
inside of neurons.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.220
For example in the
voltage clamp experiment,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.760
we imagined that we were placing
electrodes inside of cells

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.790
so that we could measure
the voltage inside of this

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.110
of cells.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.720
But it's actually quite
difficult, in general,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.490
to record membrane potentials
of neurons in behaving animals,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.710
although it's
certainly possible.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.270
It's much easier to record
electrical signals outside

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.380
of neurons.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.650
In this case, we can actually
record action potentials.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.900
And so those kinds
of recordings are

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.540
made by placing metal electrodes
that are insulated everywhere

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.720
along the shank of the electrode
except right near the tip.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.560
And if we place a metal
electrode in the brain,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.419
we can record voltage
changes in the brain

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.640
right near cells of interest.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.710
So in this case, we can
record from action potentials

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.920
of individual
neurons in behaving

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.030
animals and various aspects
of either sensory stimuli

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.555
or behavior.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.480
So this kind of recording is
called extracellular recording,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.980
and we're going to go through
a very simple analysis of how

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.790
to think about
extracellular recordings.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.660
So recall, of course, that
when we measure voltages

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.460
in the brain, we're always
measuring voltage differences.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.760
So when we place an electrode in
the brain near a cell, we are--

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.960
we connect that electrode
to an amplifier.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.830
Usually, we use a differential
amplifier that gives us--

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.480
that provides us
with a measurement

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.850
of the voltage
difference between two

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.970
terminals, the plus terminal
and the minus terminal.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.530
So we place-- we connect the
electrode to the plus terminal,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.620
and we connect
another electrode,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.320
called the ground electrode,
that can be placed in the brain

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.260
some distance away
from the brain area

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.110
that we're recording from,
or the surface of the skull.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.820
So we're measuring the
voltage that's near a cell

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.180
relative to the voltage
that's someplace further away.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.420
Now, the voltage that we measure
in the brain, voltage changes,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.080
are usually or always
associated with current flow

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.420
through the extracellular space.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.960
So we can analyze this
in terms of Ohm's law.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.850
So, basically, the voltage
changes that we are measuring

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.220
are going to be associated
with some current through

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.060
extracellular space times
some effective resistance

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.710
in the extracellular space.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.959
And you remember from
previous lectures

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.130
that the effective resistance
of extracellular space

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.820
is proportional to the
resistivity in extracellular

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.280
space times a length scale
divided by an area scale.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.090
So how do we think about
what kind of voltage changes

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.730
we might expect if we placed an
electrode near a cell that is

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.930
generating an action potential?

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.100
So let's start with
a spherical neuron,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.390
and let's give this spherical
neuron sodium channels

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.090
and potassium channels so
that it can generate an action

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.840
potential.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.750
So during an action potential,
we have an influx of sodium,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.600
followed by an
outflux of potassium,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.630
And that influx
of sodium produces

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.040
a large positive-going change
in the voltage inside the cell.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.970
So you can see that during
the rising phase of the action

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.490
potential, we have
sodium flowing in.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.750
But at the same time,
we have current flowing

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.430
outward through the membrane in
the form of capacitive current.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.740
Now, these two currents,
the sodium ions

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.510
flowing through the membrane and
the capacitive current flowing

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.970
outwards through the
membrane, are co-localized

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.720
on the same piece of membrane.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.330
And so there's no
spatial separation

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.190
of the currents flowing
through the membrane.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.140
And as a result of
that, there's actually

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.680
no current flow in
extracellular space,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.750
and so there's no
extracellular voltage changes.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.840
The first lesson from
this is that, if we

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.870
were to record an extracellular
space from a spherical neuron

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.620
with no dendrites and no
axon, we would actually not

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.460
be able to measure any
extracellular voltage change.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.340
Now let's consider
what happens if we

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.460
have a neuron with a dendrite.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.880
So in this case, when the sodium
current flows into the soma,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.850
that current, part
of it will flow out

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.000
through the capacitive--

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.550
through capacitive current,
but part of that current

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.240
will flow down
the dendrite, then

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.820
out through the membrane
through capacitive

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.690
current back to the soma.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.710
So we have a closed circuit
of current, current flowing

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.780
into the soma out
through the dendrite,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.380
and then back to the soma
through extracellular space.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.740
So in this case, if we write
down the equivalent circuit

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.540
model of what this looks like--

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.320
this is the somatic compartment,
this is the dendritic

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.700
compartment-- we have--

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.730
in our earlier calculations of
current flow through processes,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.330
through dendrites, we were
neglecting the extracellular

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.620
resistance, but in this case
we are going to include that,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.760
because that extracellular
resistance is what provides--

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.370
is what produces a voltage drop
in extracellular [? space. ?]

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.010
But during an
action potential, we

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.410
have current flowing
in through the soma,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.500
out through the inside
of the dendrite,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.520
back out through the
membrane of the dendrite,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.950
and through extracellular
space back to the soma.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:59.430
The voltage drop across this
region of extracellular space

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.210
will be proportional to this
extracellular current times

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.920
changes in
extracellular voltage.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:18.290
So now, we have a simple view
that we have current flowing

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.280
into the soma in a region--

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.630
from a region around the soma.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.250
So we have effectively what
is known as a current sink.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.250
So we have charges
flowing into the soma

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.159
in the region around the soma.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.760
That current then flows
out through the dendrite

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.789
and appears in
extracellular space

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.409
in the region of
the dendrite, and we

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.760
call that a current source.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.570
So we have a combination
of a current sink

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.990
and a current source.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.440
And you can see that the
current in extracellular space

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.490
is flowing from the current
source to the current sink.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.690
So in this case, you can see in
our simple equivalent circuit

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.520
model that the voltages are
more positive in regions

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.110
corresponding to
current sources,

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.320
and the voltages are
more negative in regions

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.700
of extracellular space
corresponding to current sink.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.540
Current is flowing from--

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.160
in extracellular
space, this current--

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.650
current is flowing from
the region of the dendrite

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.600
to the region of the soma.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.640
The voltage here
is more positive,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.514
the voltage here
is more negative.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.970
Now, let's take a look at
understanding the relationship

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.450
between the
extracellular voltage

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.000
change and the intracellular
voltage change.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.970
So let's just write
down the equation

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:57.670
for the voltage drop across
this extracellular space.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.260
That voltage drop is
just the external current

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.530
times some effective
external resistance.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.920
The external current
is just the sum

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.950
of a capacitive current
and a resistive current

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.710
through the membrane
of the dendrite.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.420
So we can write down
that voltage drop is now

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.380
proportional to an external
resistance-- extracellular

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.000
resistance, I should say.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.630
So the-- so we
can now write down

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.000
an expression for
these two currents

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.380
as a function of
membrane potential.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.160
And you recall from
earlier lectures

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.260
that the capacitive current
is just given by C dV dt,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.570
and the membrane
ionic current is

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.500
given by some conductance,
membrane ionic conductance,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.540
times the driving potential.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.020
Now, in an action potential,
voltage change is very rapid.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.170
So dv dt is large.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.600
And, in fact, this
term generally

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.340
dominates over this term
in an action potential.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:06.640
And so what we find is that the
voltage change in extracellular

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.750
space is proportional
to the derivative

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.610
of the membrane potential.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.670
And we can see that
this is the case.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.790
In earlier experiments
from Gyorgy Buzsaki's lab,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.970
they were able to
record simultaneously

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.850
from a cell intracellularly--

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.770
that's shown in
this trace here--

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.520
and the extracellular
voltage recorded

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.300
from a microwire electrode
placed near the soma.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.930
Extracellular recording
is shown here,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.250
that the extracellular
signal is actually

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.242
quite close to the derivative
of the intracellular signal.

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:53.870
Now, why is this
voltage negative?

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.450
Because the membrane
potential near the soma here,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.620
the voltage here goes negative
because during the rising phase

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.650
of the action potential,
we have sodium ions

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.700
flowing into the soma
from extracellular space.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.560
A current is flowing out
of the dendrite out here

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.080
and traveling back through
extracellular space

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.910
to the soma.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:25.730
So, again, the soma is
acting like a voltage sink,

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.360
and so the voltage is going
negative near the soma.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.150
So now let's take a look at
what happens when we have

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.260
synaptic input onto a neuron.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.570
So it turns out you can also
observe extracellular signals

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.820
that result not from
action potentials

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.990
but from synaptic inputs.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:51.096
So let's take our
example neuron and attach

00:12:51.096 --> 00:12:55.770
an excitatory synapse
to the dendrite.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.310
In this case, when the
synapse is activated,

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:04.560
if the cell is hyperpolarized,
when a neurotransmitter is

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.980
released onto the postsynaptic
compartment of the synapse,

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.600
it turns on conductances
which allow current to flow

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.550
into the dendrite.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.480
That current flows down
the dendrite to the soma,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.270
flows back capacitively
out through the soma

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:26.640
and back to the synapse
through extracellular space.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.130
So you can see
that in this case,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.760
the region near the synapse
looks like a current sink

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.340
as charges are
flowing into the cell.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.540
The region near the soma
looks like a current source

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.540
as current flows out of the soma
and back to the current sink.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.950
And see that, in this case,
you have charges flowing

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.680
into the cell, and
that should correspond

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.530
to a decrease in the
extracellular voltage.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.820
For the soma, you
have positive charges

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:02.680
flowing into extracellular space
from the inside of the cell,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.600
and that corresponds
to an increase.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.640
OK, things look different when
you have an inhibitory synapse.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.430
In the case of an
inhibitory synapse,

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.450
for example if GABA is released
onto this GABAergic synapse,

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.480
it opens chloride channels.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.100
Chloride is a negative iron
that flows into the cell,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.900
but that corresponds to
an outward-going current.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.750
So now we have the region around
the inhibitory synapse looking

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.910
like a current source.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.130
Current flows through
extracellular space

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:43.290
to the soma, where the soma
now looks like a current sink.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.250
And so in the
presence of activation

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.570
of inhibitory inputs in
the-- near the dendrites,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:58.150
you actually have an increase in
voltage of extracellular space.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.230
While near the soma, you have
a decrease in the voltage.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.530
One of the important
things to consider

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.480
is that, in the
discussion we've just had,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.660
we've been thinking about
an individual neuron, how

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.000
current sources
and current sinks

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.040
appear as a result of synaptic
activity and action potentials

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.800
around a single neuron.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.710
But in the brain,
neurons are not isolated

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:31.170
but are in the tissue next
to many other neurons, that

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.170
are also receiving
inputs and spiking.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:40.120
So it turns out that the types
of electrical extracellular

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.550
signals that you see
in the tissue depends

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:47.300
very much on how different
cells are organized spatially.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.240
So in some types of tissue,
for example in the hippocampus

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:59.440
or in the cortex, cell bodies
are lumped together in a layer,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.660
and the dendrites
are collinear and are

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.380
organized in a different layer.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.250
So this is called a
laminar morphology.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.740
In this case, many of
the synaptic inputs

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.660
arrive onto the dendrites,
and currents then

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.330
flow into the somata.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.830
And in this case, these
extracellular currents

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.110
are reinforced.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.550
They reinforce each other,
and they sum together

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:35.490
to produce very large
extracellular voltage changes.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.020
So now let's turn
to the question

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.960
of how one actually records
neural activity in the brain.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.230
So let's go back to
our experimental setup

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.190
now where we have
an electrode placed

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.860
near the soma of a neuron.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.860
And that electrode is connected
to a differential amplifier

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.400
or an instrumentation
amplifier, giving us

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.390
the voltage difference
between the extracellular

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.580
space near the soma and
the extracellular space

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.210
somewhere far away.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.010
So we-- so this
amplifier then measures

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.930
that voltage difference
and multiplies it

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.869
by a gain of
typically, let's say,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.079
a couple hundred, or
1,000, or even 10,000.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.119
We then take the output
of that amplifier

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:26.119
and put it into an analog
to digital converter, that

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:32.030
then measures the voltage
at regularly spaced samples

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:39.840
and stores those voltage
digitally in computer memory.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.030
So in analog to
digital converters,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.940
the voltage is sampled at
regular intervals, delta t,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.550
corresponding to
some sampling rate,

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:57.910
which is a frequency or a rate
that's given by 1 over delta t.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.590
So the rate at which
the samples are acquired

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.660
is referred to as the sampling
rate or sampling frequency.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.310
So if we were to record
the extracellular voltage

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.860
in a region of the
hippocampus, we

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.170
might see a signal that
looks very much like this.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.530
These are data from
Matt Wilson's lab.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.080
The signal has a
number of features.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.440
So you can see that there
is a slow modulation

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.450
of the signal that
actually corresponds

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:35.480
to the theta rhythm in a rat.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.300
That slow modulation
of the voltage

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.270
is actually caused
by synaptic currents

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.330
in the hippocampus
you can also see

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.220
that there are very
fast deflections

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.800
of the voltage corresponding
to action potentials.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.120
So, once again, this is
about a second's worth

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.120
of data of intracellular--

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.140
sorry-- of extracellular
recording from rat hippocampus,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.770
and we can see both
slow and very fast

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.858
components of this signal.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.970
The extracellular-- the action
potentials, you can see,

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.950
are very brief.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.830
They typically last
about a millisecond.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.070
If we were to look at
the amount of power

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:27.810
at different frequencies in this
signal using a technique called

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.810
measuring the power spectrum,
which we will cover in more

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.270
detail later in
class, you can see

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.690
that there is a lot of
power at low frequencies

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.830
and much less power
at high frequencies.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.990
So this is a representation
of the amount of power

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.570
at different frequencies.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.505
So we can actually extract
the fast and slow components

00:19:49.505 --> 00:19:54.660
of the signal using a technique
called high pass and low pass

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.200
filtering.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.930
So what we're going
to do is we are

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.530
going to develop
this technique that

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.860
allows us to remove
high frequency

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.290
components from
the original signal

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.400
to reveal just low-frequency
structure within the signals.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.070
So how do we do that?

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.750
Well, basically,
what we do is we're

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:21.360
going to start by using a
technique of low pass filtering

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.750
that works basically
by convolving

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.720
this signal with a kernel.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.710
What that kernel does is it
locally averages the signal

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.080
over short periods of time.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.290
So what we do is we
take that signal,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.830
and we're going to
place this kernel

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.410
over the signal at
different points

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.200
in time, average together.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.880
We're going to
multiply the kernel

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.560
by this signal at different
points of time-- in time,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.160
and plot the result down here.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.690
So let me explain
what that looks like.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.050
So let's say this is
the original signal.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.720
You can see that it's
a little bit noisy.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.410
It's fluctuating between
1 and 3, 1, 3, 1, 3.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.300
And then, at a
certain point here, it

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.750
jumps to a higher
value, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.610
So, intuitively,
we would expect low

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.840
pass filtered version of
this signal to be low here,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.950
and then jump up to
a higher value here.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.350
Now, here's our kernel.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.695
This is a representation of a
kernel that looks like this.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.307
The kernel is 0,
0.5, 0.5, and 0.

00:21:41.307 --> 00:21:42.890
And, basically, what
we're going to do

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.690
is place the kernel at some
point in time over our signal,

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:53.430
multiply the kernel
by the signal time

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.590
element by time element.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.100
So you can see that the product
of the kernel with the signal

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.160
is 0 here.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:07.010
0 times 1 is 0, 0.5 times 3
is 1.5, 0.5 times 1 is 0.5,

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.640
and 0 times 3 is 0.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.290
So that's the
product of the kernel

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.260
and the signal within
that time window.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.140
Then sum up that--

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.300
the elements of that product.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:23.350
0 plus 1.5 plus 0.5 plus 0 is 2.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.520
I'm going to write down
that sum at this point

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.410
in the filtered output.

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.980
Now, what we're going to do
is just slide the kernel over

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.390
by one element and repeat that.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:47.490
And I also added the earlier
values of the output here.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.540
So now we slide the kernel
over by one, we repeat.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.170
We get 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 0.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.300
Sum that up, we get a 2.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.020
And write down that
filtered output down here.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.090
So you can see that the low pass
filtered result of this signal

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.520
is 2 everywhere up to here.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.870
Now, if we slide the kernel
over one more and multiply,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.730
you can see we get a 0, a 1.5.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.350
Here's 0.5 times 5.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.360
That's 2.5.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.190
0 times 3 is 0.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:28.260
And the sum of that, the sum
of those four elements is 4.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.640
Write down a 4 here.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.220
And if we keep doing that, all
of the rest of those values

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.300
is 4, which you can verify.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.960
So you can see that
the low pass filtered

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.380
version of this signal,
filtered by this kernel,

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.500
is 2 up to this point,
and then it jumps up

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.350
to 4, which was consistent
with our intuition

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.710
about what low pass
filtering would do.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.750
So that was low pass filtering.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.760
Now, how would we
high pass filter?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.990
How would we extract out these
high frequency components

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.970
from the data, throw away
the low frequency components?

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.344
Well, one way to think about
this is that we actually--

00:24:12.344 --> 00:24:15.020
we can get rid of
the low frequency

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.490
elements simply by
subtracting off the low pass

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.330
signal that we just calculated.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.510
So how do we do that?

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.630
So we're going to
use this kernel here

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.030
to do our high pass filtering.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.070
And notice that this
kernel has two components.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.120
It has a square component
that's negative,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.700
and it has a delta
function at 0.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.120
So you can see that
this negative component

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:49.990
of this high pass filter looks
a lot like the negative of our--

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.510
looks like the negative
of our low pass filter.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.700
So if we were to
take this kernel

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.190
and instead use
a kernel that was

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.910
the negative of that
kernel, like this, then what

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.730
we would get is the
negative of this low passed,

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.790
of this filtered signal.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:21.660
So this part right here, this
part of the high pass filter,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.450
is producing the negative
of our low pass filter.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.810
Now let's take a look
at this component here.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.230
This component is a delta
function with a value of 1

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.310
at the peak.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.280
You can see that if you
convolve that kernel

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.050
with your original
signal, it just

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.520
gives you back the
same original signal.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.060
So what we've done is this
component simply gives us

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.890
back the original signal.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:49.930
This component subtracts off the
low pass version of the signal.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.570
What we're left with is
the high pass version.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.960
Let's look at what that does
to the spectrum of our signal.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.050
You can see that,
the high pass, we've

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:04.030
gotten rid of all of these low
frequencies, all of the power

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.010
at low frequencies,
and we're left

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.130
with just the high frequency
part of our signal.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.250
And if we go back and look
at the spectrum of what

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.800
the low passed
signal looks like,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.070
we can see that the low passed
output retains all of the power

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.090
at low frequencies and gets
rid of these high frequency

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.690
components [AUDIO OUT].

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:33.760
Low passed signal has no
power at high frequencies.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.550
So once we have extracted
high pass filtered

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.850
version of the signal, you can
see that what you're left with

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.800
are action potentials.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.680
So what we're going
to talk about now

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.010
is how you actually extract
these action potentials

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.400
and figure out when
action potentials occurred

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.850
during this behavior.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.900
Next thing we're going
to do is detect--

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.060
we're going to do
spike detection.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.240
So, basically, the best
way to detect spikes

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.870
is to look at the
signal, plot the signal,

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:17.020
and figure out what
amplitude the spikes are.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:22.210
So look at the voltage of the
peak, the peak of the spikes.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:27.840
And then set a threshold
that consistently

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.800
is crossed by that peak
in the spike waveform.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.050
So here are the individual
samples associated

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.450
with one action potential.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.610
You can see that a
voltage right about here

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.850
will reliably
detect these spikes.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:47.930
And then, basically, you
write one line of MATLAB code

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.620
that detects where
this voltage crossed

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.580
from being below your threshold
on one sample to being

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.070
above your threshold
on the next.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.300
Now what we can do
is, once we detect

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:07.190
the time at which that
threshold crossing occurred,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.220
we can write down that
threshold crossing time

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.580
for each spike in our wave form.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.590
The spike here, we
write down that time.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.430
That's t1.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.380
If you have another
threshold crossing here,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.650
you write that time down, t2.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:25.990
And you collect all of these
spike times into an array.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:30.260
So we can now represent
the spike train

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.280
as a list of spike times.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:39.710
So we're going represent this
as variable t with an index

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.730
i, where i goes
from 1 to N. Now,

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:48.310
we can also think of spike
trains as a delta function.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.980
So you may remember
that a delta function

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.990
is 0 everywhere except at the
time where the argument is 0.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.830
So this delta function is
0 everywhere except when

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.425
t is equal to t signal.

00:29:03.425 --> 00:29:07.960
That's when t is equal to
the time of the signal.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.830
At that time, the delta
function has a non-zero value.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.610
So we can write down
this spike train

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.320
as a sum of delta functions.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.890
So the spike train
is a function of time

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.100
is delta of t minus
t1, corresponding

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.750
to the first spike, plus
another delta function at time

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:33.730
t2 corresponding to
that spike, and so on.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:39.390
So we can now write down
mathematically our spike train

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:45.210
as a sum of delta functions,
one at each spike time.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.360
We can also think
of a spike train

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.600
as being the derivative
of a spike count function.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.040
So a spike count function
will reflect the number

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.260
of spikes that have occurred
at times less than the time

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.860
in the argument.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:08.430
So if this is our spike train,
then prior to the first spike,

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:13.800
there will be zero spikes
in our spike count function.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.730
After the first spike, then
we'll have a spike count of 1.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.840
And you can see that you get
this stairstep increasing

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.840
to the right for each
spike in the spike train.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.640
Since the integral of this
spike train has units--

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.060
the integral over time
has units of spikes,

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.220
you can see that the spike
train, this rho of t,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.270
has units of spikes per second.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.840
So now let's turn
to the question

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.220
of what we can extract
from neural activity

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.500
by measuring spike trains.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.420
So one of the
simplest properties

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.430
that we find about
cells in the brain

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:08.320
is that they usually
have a firing rate that

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.210
depends on something,
either a motor

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.760
behavior or a sensory stimulus.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.230
So, for example, simple cells
in primary visual cortex,

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:22.480
of the cat in this case, are
responsive to the orientation

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.210
of visual--

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.870
of stimuli in the visual field.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.670
So this shows a bar of
light, but represents

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.400
a bright bar of light on a
black background, actually.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.610
And you can see that if
you move this bar in space,

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.190
at this orientation this
neuron doesn't respond.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.560
But if we rotate the--

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.320
if we rotate this bar of light
and move it in this direction,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.710
now the cell responds
with a high firing rate.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.710
So if we quantify
the firing rate

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.420
as a function of orientation
of this bar of light,

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.590
you can see that the
neuron has a higher firing

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.600
rate for some orientations
than for others.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.900
That property of being tuned
for particular stimulus features

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.790
is called tuning,
and the measurement

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.600
of that firing rate as a
function of some parameter

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.444
is called a tuning curve.

00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:27.630
So you can see that in
primary visual cortex,

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.450
neurons are tuned
to orientation.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:35.130
And the tuning curves of
neurons in primary visual cortex

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:41.850
often have this characteristic
of being highly responsive

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:45.240
at particular orientations,
and then smoothly dropping off

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.130
to being unresponsive
at other orientations.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.566
So in a similar--

00:32:52.566 --> 00:32:55.800
similar to the way that
neurons in visual cortex

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.840
are tuned to orientation,
neurons in auditory cortex

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.100
are tuned to
different frequencies.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.020
So, for example, in
the auditory system,

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.690
when sound impinges
on the ear, it

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:14.030
transmits vibrations
into the cochlea.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.480
Those vibrations enter
the cochlea and propagate

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.020
along a basilar membrane,
where vibrations

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.480
of particular
frequencies are amplified

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.750
at particular locations,
and the membrane

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:32.280
is unresponsive to vibrations
of other frequencies.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.040
So if you [? learn ?]
from neurons

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.380
in visual cortex and you--

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.020
sorry-- in auditory cortex
and you play a tone,

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:46.610
so this shows a philograph
of a auditory stimulus.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:50.570
At some frequency, you can
see that this neuron spiked

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.476
robustly in response to that.

00:33:53.476 --> 00:34:00.090
So Individual neurons are
tuned to respond robustly

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.810
at particular frequencies
but not other frequencies.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:09.120
And you can see that
different neurons

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.080
are selective to
different frequencies.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.530
So you can see that this
curve representing one neuron,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.429
that neuron is most
active for frequencies

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.060
around a little bit
above 5 kilohertz,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.241
whereas other neurons are
most responsive to frequencies

00:34:27.241 --> 00:34:28.491
around 6 kilohertz, and so on.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.250
So we saw an example now of
how firing rates of neurons

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:40.230
in sensory cortex are sensitive
to particular parameters

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.469
of the sensory stimulus.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:47.940
This property of tuning applies
not only to sensory neurons

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.639
but also to neurons
in motor cortex.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:54.630
This shows the results
of a classic experiment

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:59.640
on analyzing the spiking
activity of neurons

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.390
in motor cortex
during the movements,

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.560
during our movements in
different directions.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.280
So this shows a manipulandum.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.220
This is basically a
little arm that the monkey

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.910
can grab the handle here
and move that arm around.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.450
The monkey's task
is to hold that--

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:23.370
hold this arm at a
central location.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.620
And then a light comes
on, and the monkey

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.320
has to move this
manipulandum from the center

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.590
out to the location of
the light that turned on.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.310
And so the experiment is
repeated multiple times

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.790
where the monkey has to move
to different directions.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.250
You can see here
the trajectories

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.980
that the monkey went through
as it moves from the center

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.520
location out to these eight
different target locations.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.080
And in this experiment,
neurons were

00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:00.440
recorded at different regions of
motor cortex, and the results--

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.290
the resulting spike
trains were plotted.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.975
In this figure, you
can see what are

00:36:05.975 --> 00:36:08.180
called raster plots, where--

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.760
for example, for movements
in this direction,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.260
five trials were
collected together.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.770
So each row here
corresponds to the spikes

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.130
that a neuron generated during
movements from the center

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:24.154
to this direction.

00:36:24.154 --> 00:36:29.640
You can see that the neuron
became active just after

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.240
the [INAUDIBLE],, indicating
which direction was turned

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.550
on, and prior to the
onset of the movement,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.234
which is indicated [AUDIO OUT].

00:36:39.234 --> 00:36:42.160
You can see that the
neuron responded robustly

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.300
on every single trial to
movements in this direction.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.230
But the neuron responded
quite differently

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.730
in some other direction.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.460
So you can see that the
response to downward movement

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.750
was quite weak.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.750
There was essentially no
change in the firing rate.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.100
And you can see the to
movements in other directions,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.580
for example to the
right, were associated

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.330
with an actual suppression
of the spiking activity.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.650
So I should just point out
briefly that these spikes here

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:16.330
and here, before and after
the onset of the trial,

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.980
are spontaneous spikes that
occurred continuously even when

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.070
the monkey wasn't engaged
in moving the handle.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.740
So we have a
spontaneous firing rate,

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.680
the trial initiates an
increase in firing rate,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:36.680
and then a recovery to
the baseline position.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.660
So you can see that
these motor cortical

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:43.490
neurons exhibit tuning for
particular movement directions.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:47.480
And we can quantify this now by
counting the number of spikes

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.660
in this movement interval,
and plotting that

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.760
as a function of the
angle of the movement.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.250
And when you that, you
can see that movements

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.150
in particular
directions, in this case

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:05.620
[AUDIO OUT] by degree direction,
resulted in high firing rates,

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.450
whereas movements
in other directions

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:11.090
resulted in lower firing rates.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:14.080
So in order to do this
kind of quantification,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.600
we need to be able to--

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.480
we need to understand
a few different methods

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.080
for how we can actually
quantify firing rates.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.030
The simplest thing
that I just described

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.910
here is to just count
the number of spikes

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.880
in some particular
interval that you decide

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.960
is relevant for your experiment.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.400
So, for example, let's say
we have a stimulus that

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.510
turns on at a particular
time, is-- it stays on,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.420
and then turns off
at some later time.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.690
On different trials of that--
or different presentations

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.750
of that stimulus, you
can see that the spike

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:56.390
train- that the neuron spikes
in a somewhat different way.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.960
But you can see that
this sample neuron here,

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.170
that I just made up, you can
see that, in general, there

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.840
is a vague increase in the
firing rate after the onset

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.440
of the stimulus.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.510
So we can quantify that by
simply setting a relevant time

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:19.262
window and counting the number
of spikes in that time window.

00:39:19.262 --> 00:39:20.720
So we're going to
set a time window

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.740
T from the onset of the stimulus
to the offset of the stimulus,

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.300
and simply count the number
of spikes on each trial.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.030
So N is the number of spikes
that occurred on the ith trial.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:40.450
The brackets here represent
the average over that quantity

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.630
i, which is trial number.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.510
So we're going to count the
number of spikes on the ith

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:49.215
trial and average
that over trials.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.350
So then, once we have
that average count,

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:01.600
we simply divide by the interval
T that we're counting over,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.070
and that gives us a rate.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.570
Now, you can see that the number
of spikes, the firing rate

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:08.620
is not constant.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.690
So you can see in this
little toy example

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.170
here that, the
way I've drawn it,

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:18.520
that the spike rate
increases at stimulus onset,

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.900
and then it decayed away,
which is very typical.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.440
So you're throwing away
a lot of information.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.960
Now, the way that we just
quantified that firing rate,

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.540
we just counted spikes over the
whole stimulus presentation.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.620
But if we want to get more
temporal resolution in how

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.140
we quantify the firing
rate, we can actually

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.420
just break the
period of interest

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.650
up into smaller pieces,
count the number of spikes,

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:47.290
the average number of spikes in
each one of these smaller bins,

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:51.040
and divide by the interval
of these smaller bins.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.560
So, for example, we can have--

00:40:53.560 --> 00:41:01.810
we can count the number of
spikes on trial i and then j.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.600
And we can average
the number of spikes

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.360
in the jth bin, overall trials.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.800
So that's just
the average number

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.140
of spikes in this
first bin, for example,

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.440
and divide by the
interval delta T.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.080
And so now you can see that you
have a different rate, finer

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.270
temporal resolution.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.550
So, for example, if you
look at the analysis

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.090
that Georgopoulos did
in that 1982 paper

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.670
for the arm movements
of the monkey,

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:38.270
they broke the trials up
into small bins of about 10

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.460
or 20 milliseconds each,
counted the number of spikes

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.220
in each one of those bins,
divided by that bin width,

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:50.082
and computed the firing
rate, spikes per second,

00:41:50.082 --> 00:41:51.926
in each one of those bins.

00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:55.060
You can see that they
did one other thing here.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:42:02.160
The average firing
rate during each bin

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.530
in which we've subtracted
off the firing rate

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.260
in the pre-stimulus period.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.980
So that is, very
typically, what you'll

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.860
see in a neuroscience
paper describing

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.410
the behavior of
neurons to a stimulus

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:22.230
or during a motor task.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:26.100
And so we can use similar
tricks to estimate

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:32.520
the firing rate of neurons in
just a continuous spike train.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.130
So not all neuroscience
experiments

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:39.420
are done in trials like this,
where we present a stimulus

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.040
and then turn it off.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.800
Some trials-- some experiments
are done, for example,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.120
where a movie may--

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.140
a monkey or an animal
might be in a movie

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.630
where stimuli are
presented continuously.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.210
So you don't have this
clear trial structure.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.060
So we can also
quantify firing rates

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.640
in cases where we just
have a continuous spike

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.770
train without trials.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:03.810
And we can do that,
again, by just taking

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:09.270
that continuous spike train and
breaking it up into intervals.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:14.310
So there will be N
sub j spikes in bin j,

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:18.330
and then the bin has
some width delta T. Now,

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.580
one problem that you can
see immediately from this

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:25.320
is that the answer you get
will depend on where you place

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.530
the boundaries of the bin.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.390
So if you take all these bins
and you shift them over by,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.820
let's say, half of--

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.620
shift them over
by delta T over 2,

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.870
you can see that you can get a
completely different set of--

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:42.690
a different set of firing rates
for this same spike train.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:46.720
So there's not a unique answer.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:54.060
So another way to do this
is to quantify firing rates

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.910
in bins that are shifted
to all possible times.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:05.860
So, for example, we
can take a window

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:11.540
where we have 0 everywhere
except within this window.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.828
We can now multiply
the spike train.

00:44:13.828 --> 00:44:15.370
Well, one way to do
this would simply

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:19.030
be to count the number of
spikes within that window,

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.940
and then shift the window over
and count the number of spikes,

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.730
and shift the window over and
count the number of spikes.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.860
And now you get
a count of number

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.670
of spikes in each
of those windows

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.780
for all the windows
that have width delta T,

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:37.330
but we've shifted it
in small time steps.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.070
But how can we describe
that mathematically?

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:44.630
Well, you may recall
that this, in fact,

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.030
looks a lot like a convolution.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.450
We're going to take
this square kernel,

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:54.530
and we're going to multiply
it by the spike train

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.900
and count the number
of spikes, take

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.100
the integral over that product.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.680
And you can see that
that's basically

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.350
going to give you
the number of spikes

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.170
within that window
from t1 to t2.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.480
So, for example,
in this case we're

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.020
going to use a square window.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.980
The firing rate is
just going to be

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.960
given by the number
of spikes divided

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.670
by the width of the window.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.760
And that's just 1
over delta T times

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.870
the integral t minus
delta T over 2 to t

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.760
plus delta T over 2,
sliding that gradually

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.480
over the spike train.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.780
So we're effectively
convolving our spike train

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.310
with this rectangular kernel.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.750
And that's what it looks
like mathematically.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.890
The firing rate is the
convolution of the spike train

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.540
with this smoothing kernel.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.730
So, as I mentioned,
that's just a convolution,

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.610
and we're convolving our spike
train with this square kernel

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.270
of this width.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:00.790
So that is the mathematical
expression for a convolution.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.690
the firing rate is
just the convolution

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:08.430
of this kernel with
the spike train.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.520
And, again, the
kernel is 0 everywhere

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.660
except within this window,
minus delta T over 2

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.010
to plus delta T over 2, and it
has a height of 1 over delta T

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:24.270
such that we make the area 1.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:29.760
Notationally, we often write
that as a star, rho star K.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.710
Now, in this case we were
convolving our spike train

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.440
with a square kernel.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.060
The problem with
a square kernel is

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.960
that it changes abruptly
every time a spike

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.750
comes into the window or
drops out of the window.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.000
A more common way of
quantifying firing rates

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.360
is to convolve the spike
train with a Gaussian kernel.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.620
So instead of using
a square kernel here,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.200
we're going to use a Gaussian
kernel that looks like this.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.490
The kernel is just defined
as this Gaussian function.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:09.140
And it's normalized by
1 over sigma root 2 pi,

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.820
and this normalization gives
area under that kernel, 1.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.320
So it's still essentially
counting the number

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.210
of spikes within that window.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.030
It's again just a
weighted average

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:29.010
of the number of spikes divided
by the width of the kernel,

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.740
but there's less
weight at the edges.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.590
It has smoother edges,
and that gives you

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:38.340
a less steppy-looking
result. So let me show you

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.250
what that looks like.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.920
So here's a spike train.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.030
If we take fixed bins and
compute the firing rate

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.560
as a function of time,
it looks like this.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.300
If we take that spike
train and we convolve it,

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.670
and that estimate
of firing it would

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.910
depend very much on where
exactly the windows are placed.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.910
On the other hand, this
shows the firing rate

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:04.580
estimated with a square
kernel of the same width.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.390
And you can see that it shows
a much smoother estimate,

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:13.218
a smoother representation of the
firing rate varying over time.

00:48:13.218 --> 00:48:14.760
And if you take that
same spike train

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.840
and you convolve
it with a Gaussian,

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.930
then you get a function
that looks like this.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.670
And we think of this as
perhaps better representing

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.980
the underlying
process in the brain

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.280
that produces this
time-varying firing

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.070
rate, this time-varying
spike train,

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.760
than either of these two.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.000
You don't really think that
the firing rate of this neuron

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.880
is jumping around in
rectangular steps.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.740
We think of it as
being some kind

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.080
of smooth, continuous
underlying function

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.885
that represents maybe
the input to that neuron.

00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:52.110
Youll see that in these
estimates of firing rate,

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.250
we had to actually choose
a width for our window.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.042
We had to choose a bin size.

00:48:57.042 --> 00:48:59.250
We had to choose the width
of our square kernel here,

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.700
and we had to choose the width
of our Gaussian kernel here.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.690
And you can see that
the answer, actually,

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:10.530
that you get for firing
rate as a function of time

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:15.240
depends very
strongly on the size

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.220
or the width of that kernel
that you choose to use.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.180
And now we smooth it
with a Gaussian kernel

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.960
that has a width, a
sigma, of 4 milliseconds.

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.400
So that's the standard
deviation of the Gaussian

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.490
that we use to smooth
the spike train.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:32.340
And you can see
that what you get

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.340
is a very peaky estimate
of the firing rate.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:40.000
So that spike produces
this little peak.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.350
But the question is,
what's the right answer?

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:46.980
How should you actually
choose the size

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.070
of the kernel to use
to estimate firing

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.710
rate for your experiment?

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:56.760
The answer is that it really
depends on the experiment.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.650
So neural spike trains
have widely different

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:02.800
temporal structure.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.990
So, first of all, neuronal
responses aren't constant.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.270
Firing rates are not
a constant thing.

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.970
Neurons-- neural firing
rates are constantly

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:16.062
changing depending on the
type of stimulus that you use.

00:50:16.062 --> 00:50:17.520
And different types
of neurons have

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.352
different temporal structure in
response to the same stimuli.

00:50:20.352 --> 00:50:23.520
So, for example, this
shows the response

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:32.370
of four different
neurons to stimuli, to--

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.200
four different neurons
in rat vibrissa

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.910
cortex in response to
whisker deflections.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.790
So this shows a
raster, a histogram

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:48.240
of firing rate as a function of
time for one neuron in response

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.970
to a deflection of one of
the whiskers right here.

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:54.750
So the whisker is at
rest, deflected, and then

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.760
relaxed back to its
original position.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.730
You can see that
this neuron shows

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.300
a little burst of activity at
the onset of the deflection,

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.810
and it's fairly persistent
throughout the deflection.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:10.170
Here's another neuron
during a deflection.

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:13.770
Increased activity at the
onset of the deflection,

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:18.120
followed by a fairly
persistent increased spiking

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.080
rate throughout the deflection.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:26.190
Now, a different neuron was
quite a different behavior.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:33.390
So this neuron shows a brief
increase in firing rate

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.550
just at the time of the
deflection, a little increase

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.670
of firing rate when the
deflection is removed,

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.040
and [INAUDIBLE] no
activity that persists

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.130
during this constant
part of the deflection.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.000
Here's another neuron.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
This neuron was primarily active
at the onset of the deflection.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.840
Here's another neuron
that was silent

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.535
at the onset of the
deflection, and then gave

00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:03.260
a robust response.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.250
Neurons, the changes
in firing rate

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:11.360
are not of a
particular timescale.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.820
Different neurons have
different time scales

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.740
on which the changes in their
firing rate are important.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.380
But let's come back to our
example of our auditory neuron.

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.480
Here's the spiking
of an auditory neuron

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.510
during the presentation of an
auditory stimulus [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.280
right here.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.010
This neuron-- in fact,
you can't see it here,

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:37.220
but this neuron shows
spiking at a particular phase

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.390
of the auditory stimulus,
much like the auditory

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.960
neurons that we discussed for
sound localization in the owl.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:51.370
So if you plot the firing
rate of this neuron

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.450
as a function of time during the
presentation of this stimulus,

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.420
you can see that the
firing rates are rapidly

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.500
modulated in time.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.170
You can see that, at particular
phases of this stimulus,

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.010
the firing rate is very high.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.070
And then just a
millisecond later,

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:10.520
the firing rate is very low.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.880
So in this case, you
can see that the spikes

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.840
are locked temporally
at particular phases

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.240
of the stimulus.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.810
That's reflected when you
make plots of firing rate

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:24.860
as a function of time.

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.650
It's reflected in
various modulations.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:31.700
The neurons are firing
at a particular time.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.570
So this corresponds
to a case in which

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:39.370
we would say that the
spike timing is precisely

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:41.150
controlled by the stimulus.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:46.390
It's, in many ways, more natural
here to think about spike times

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:51.700
as being controlled rather
than spike firing rate being

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.330
modulated.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:54:00.940
So you can see here that
sensory neurons, neurons

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:05.200
can spike more in response
to some stimuli than others.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.310
Motor neurons spike more
during some behaviors more

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.460
than others.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.450
We can think about
information being carried

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:19.120
in the number of spikes that
are generated by a stimulus

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.720
or during a motor act.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.780
Now, all neurons exhibit
temporal modulation

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.160
in their firing rates.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:30.960
They fire more during a movement
or after the presentation

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.070
of a stimulus.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:35.490
Sometimes that information is
carried by slow modulations

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:36.300
in the firing rate.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:42.090
For example, the response
to different oriented bars

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.780
is carried in the average
firing rate of the neuron

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.220
during that particular stimulus.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.600
And we can refer to
that kind of code

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.460
and that kind of representation
of information as rate coding.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.280
We can say that information
about the stimulus

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:03.200
is carried in the rate, the
firing rate of the neurons.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.320
But in other cases,
like the auditory neuron

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.900
that we just saw, we
can see that information

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:12.550
is carried by rapid,
by fast modulations,

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:15.490
rapid changes in
spike probability.

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:17.710
And in that case, we
often say that information

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.690
is coded by spike timing.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:27.000
So a common question that
you often hear about neurons

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.172
is whether they're
coding information

00:55:31.172 --> 00:55:34.760
using firing rate
or temporal coding,

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.670
rate coding versus
temporal coding.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.620
Really, this is a
false dichotomy.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.650
You shouldn't think about
neurons coding information one

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:43.470
way or the other.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:48.540
These are just-- really just
two limits of a continuum.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.350
The brain uses information
at fast time scales

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:53.370
as well as slow time scales.

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:56.990
And how do we determine,
how do we know

00:55:56.990 --> 00:56:00.170
what's important for the brain?

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:01.940
What time scales are important?

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.520
And the answer to
that question really

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.350
comes from understanding the
way spike trains are read out

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.920
by the neurons that
they project to.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.590
What time scale is relevant
for the computation

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:19.250
that's being done in the
system that you're studying?

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:21.380
What are the
biophysical mechanisms

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.260
that those spikes act on.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:28.460
To understand these
questions, then that's

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.200
the appropriate
level of analysis

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.470
to think about how
spike trains are

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:38.980
important for our sensory
coding and for motor behavior.

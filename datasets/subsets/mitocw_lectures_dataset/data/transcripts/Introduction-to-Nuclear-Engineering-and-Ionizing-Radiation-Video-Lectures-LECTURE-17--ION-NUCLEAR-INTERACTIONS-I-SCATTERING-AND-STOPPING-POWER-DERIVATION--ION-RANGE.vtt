00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:24.600
PROFESSOR: I wanted to do a
quick review of all the photon

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.767
interactions, because I've
released problems at 5:00

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.380
for you guys.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.701
It involves your banana data.

00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.159
So we're going to be taking a
second look at all the banana

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.850
data and the problem statement
for the lab part is simple.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.680
Identify all the peaks.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.888
Tell me where they came from.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.805
And tell me all the peaks
that should be there

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:42.000
that you don't see and why.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.090
And that's like a quarter of
the problem set or something.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.670
So just to review
the three effects

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.070
that we talked about sort
of in order of what energies

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.350
they're important in,
my spelling I'm sure

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.090
will be slower than usual today.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.300
I spent like 3 and
1/2 days listening

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
to Russian presentations with an
English translator microphone.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.008
Russian scientific presentation
is really similar to English.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:14.550
All the technical
words are the same,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.967
but as soon as you start trying
to talk to a two-year-old,

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:17.910
you're just lost.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.230
But it's pretty cool.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.700
So we went over the
photoelectric effect,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.818
Compton scattering,
and pair production.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.720
And so in addition to
knowing what these three

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.020
mechanisms actually are and how
to tell what they would look

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.270
like on a given
detector spectrum,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.953
the other two important
things we wanted to remember

00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:44.620
are what are the
cross-sections, so what

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.290
are the relative probabilities
of each happening

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.860
as a function of their energy
the photon and the material

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.310
that they're going in and then
filling in this map of if you

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.337
have energy and z, where are
these effects most prevalent?

00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:00.670
Does anyone want to kick me off?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.250
Does anyone remember the general
form of the cross-sections

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.048
for any of these effects?

00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:08.090
Or does anyone remember
what this map looks like?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.260
Yeah?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.142
Chris.

00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:15.560
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.437
PROFESSOR: Indeed.

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:18.690
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.370
So pair production--

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.830
I think we gave it
the symbol kappa

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.230
to go along with a reading
that you guys have--

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.510
was around here.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.745
That's because it's not going
to happen below 1.022 MeV,

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:34.120
because you need the energy
to make the positron electron

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.900
pair.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.570
And indeed, the more electrons
there are in each atom,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.690
the more likely
pair production is,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.390
this happens when the photon
gets near the nucleus, which

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.690
is going to have a higher
charge for higher z and so on.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.560
And so pair production,
it was proportional to--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.590
you'll never need to
know the exact things

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.590
that the cross-sections.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.880
That's what books are for.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.190
But it was proportional to--

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.770
let's see, I think it was
like z to the third or fourth,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.050
pretty strong like that.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.370
What about Compton scattering?

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.764
Where does that lie on this map?

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:10.942
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:12.400
PROFESSOR: Yup,
high z, low energy.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.840
So in this general region.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.550
We'll just give it a C
for Compton scattering.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.510
And in that one,
the cross-section

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.610
was proportional
to something like 1

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.510
over the energy or h bar
omega in your reading.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.520
That's the same thing
as saying photon energy.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.960
And then what about
photoelectric effect?

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.732
Well, that's the only
place there is left, right?

00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:35.940
We'll give it the symbol tau.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.210
So I'll put these up here.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.790
I don't quite know why
they chose those symbols.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.100
But I'll just stick to the
notation in the reading.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.710
And then the idea here is this
was proportional to something

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.190
like z to the fifth over--

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.280
what is it, like
energy to the like 7/2.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.640
So significantly low energy,
significantly high z.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.320
And does anyone
remember at what energy

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.390
does the photoelectric
effect start to kick in?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.720
Very close to zero.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.700
So here, the energy has got to
be greater than or equal to,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.349
but what is the photoelectric
effect physically?

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.695
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:21.320
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.910
A gamma gets absorbed,
or any photon

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.800
gets absorbed that
knocks out an electron.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.748
So how energetic does it have
to be to knock out the electron?

00:04:27.748 --> 00:04:30.040
STUDENT: Binding energy
of the electrons.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.320
PROFESSOR: The binding energy
of the lowest bound electron,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.770
which we give that symbol
phi or the work function.

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:43.510
The idea here is that as soon
as you have enough energy

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.130
to eject the outermost
electron, which

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.330
is super low for the alkali
metals, like sodium, potassium,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.090
cesium, then you can
exceed the work function

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.370
and get the photoelectric
effect going.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.200
And for this one, we
said the energy here

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.740
has to be greater than or
equal to 2 times the rest

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.126
mass of the electron c squared,
better known as 1.022 MeV.

00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:11.130
Is there a minimum energy
for Compton scattering?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.180
Photons can scatter.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.580
They don't have to have
any energy to scatter.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.700
Certainly.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.410
And let's see the two
interesting bits of technology

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.790
we talked about
related to these,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.370
one was called a Compton
camera, where you could actually

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.680
use two detectors.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.130
Let's say you're looking for
a tiny source in a big box

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.910
somewhere.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.410
You can have one detector.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.290
And you can have
a second detector,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.430
so that this source is sending
out gammas in all directions.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.420
And let's say one of them
interacts with detector one,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.800
bounces off, and
interacts in detector two.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.660
At that point,
you've constrained

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.750
sort of the angle
between these detectors,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.570
so that you know what
energy the gamma came from.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.260
And you know generally where
it came from physically, which

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.290
is a cool piece of equipment.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.898
I'm going to try
to find pictures

00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:03.940
of one of these actual
things, because I actually

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.270
haven't seen one myself.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.437
I've just heard it described
physically and it seems

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:08.130
to make sense.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.280
And the second one
that we touched upon

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.760
at the very end of last class
had to do with this thing right

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.260
here.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.220
Does anyone remember
thermionic devices?

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.110
Well, the work function
for some materials,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.410
like for cesium,
the work function

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.170
is a little less than an eV.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.930
It's like 0.7
electron volts, which

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.750
means when you get things
up to about 2,000 Celsius

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.348
or so, the temperature
of the atoms themselves

00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:36.640
exceeds the work function,
and the outer electrons just

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.900
boil off.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:45.220
So if you have two pieces of
material, probably in a vacuum,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.700
and one of them is like 2,000 C,
and one of them is, let's say,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.130
room temperature, you end up
with this net flux of electrons

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.035
boiling off the hot
one to the cold one.

00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:57.910
And this has been one
of the methods proposed

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.800
to directly convert
heat to electricity

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.900
for ultra high
temperature applications,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.940
like space reactors
or other things that

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.190
can get super crazy hot.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.560
So it's one of those energy
conversion mechanisms-- did

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.180
anyone ever hear about
this one in high school?

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.810
Highly, highly doubt that
it would ever be mentioned.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.930
One of the professors in our
department, Elias Gyftopoulos

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.290
was one of the folks that
came up with this whole idea.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.520
And in my senior design
course, we actually

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.280
designed a space reactor
that uses thermionics,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.550
and he showed up in the
audience by surprise.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.258
And that's probably
the dumbest I've ever

00:07:31.258 --> 00:07:33.250
looked at a presentation,
explaining something

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.600
that someone invented.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.960
They knew every single mistake
and everything that was wrong.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.500
So since then I've kind of boned
up on thermionics knowledge.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.800
But that's enough
for the photon stuff.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.130
Now we want to start getting
into ion nuclear interactions

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.230
and in today's reading,
it started off--

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.060
I think the first
paragraph went something

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.550
like, the formula
for stopping power

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.780
can be expressed as follows.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.790
Squared times log of--

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.660
squared over mean
ionization energy.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.480
And I find this explanation
to be unsatisfactory.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.730
I'm not a fan of the kind
of books that just say,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.540
here's a formula.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.530
For practice, plug
things in and use them.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.440
So instead, I'm
going to skip ahead

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.750
to a little bit of
next week's reading

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.180
or the [INAUDIBLE] reading
and actually derive it.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.790
So when I just throw
up a formula like this,

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.310
it's like how the hell do
you remember that, right?

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.370
Well, it's going to make a lot
more sense once we actually

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.600
derive it.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.940
So let's set up this problem.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.490
You have a charged particle
with charge little z times e.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.230
Little z, we'll
say, is the number

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.190
of protons in this
nucleus or the charge

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.070
on an electron if you
want it, times the unit

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.090
charge of an electron.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.430
And it's firing at
some other electron

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.630
somewhere else in the material.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.580
So the basis of any sort
of ion electron interaction

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.993
has to start with the ion being
either struck or repelled--

00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:06.410
I'm sorry, with
the electron being

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.720
struck a repelled by the ion.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.220
And so let's say
that this ion exists.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.920
We'll draw kind
of a unit cylinder

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.940
around this physical situation.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.450
And if we draw this
distance right here,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.000
it's one of those
rare cases where

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.450
the nomenclature is the same
in pretty much every reading.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.551
There's this distance b, which
we call the impact parameter.

00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:35.420
It's kind of a
funny name for it,

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.810
but it just means by how
close does your particle

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.150
get to that electron
when it undergoes

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.280
this single interaction.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.550
And so this particle is moving
quite fast with some speed

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.468
v towards and then away
from this electron.

00:09:49.468 --> 00:09:51.010
And what's going to
happen is there's

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.540
going to be some
sort of a Coulomb

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.660
force between this charged
particle and this electron.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.090
So let's say you're firing
an electron at an electron.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.340
There's going to be
some negative repulsion.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.873
Or if you're firing
an ion at an electron,

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:07.540
there might be some
positive attraction.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.570
But at any rate, there's
going to be some deflection.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.000
So let's just say it's a
negatively charged particle.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.960
If we draw its
actual trajectory,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.250
it's actually going to
go off kind of barely

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.840
in that direction, right?

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.250
Two charges passing
in the night.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.930
They know each other's there.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.920
And they kind of
repel each other.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.710
So what we want to
do is figure out

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.080
what is the total
amount of force in the x

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.180
and the y direction.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.680
Let's just define our axes
to make sure we're all

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.180
on the same page.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.120
And can we resolve that into
a total amount of energy

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.060
lost per unit distance?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.460
This quantity right here was for
referred to as stopping power.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.040
Before we launch
into it, does anyone

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.420
know why I put a negative
sign on this quantity?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.578
STUDENT: This is
all [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:59.578 --> 00:11:00.370
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.913
Yep.

00:11:00.913 --> 00:11:02.830
If you're changing the
energy in the particle,

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.205
unless it's, let's
say, following

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.870
it to some gravitational field,
which we're not covering today

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.390
or ever then, it's any
sort of interaction

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.730
is going to cause the
particle to lose some energy.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.450
So this quantity right here
is going to be negative,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.610
and so this quantity right
here is going to be positive.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.870
We stick a minus
sign in front of it.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.970
But let's get back
to the basics then.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.900
What is the force between
this charged particle

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.148
and the electron from 802?

00:11:33.812 --> 00:11:34.945
This Coulomb force.

00:11:40.558 --> 00:11:41.600
STUDENT: It's a constant.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.660
PROFESSOR: There is a constant.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.365
Let's just call it k0, because
the reading calls it k0.

00:11:46.365 --> 00:11:49.290
STUDENT: And then it'd
be z e [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.130
Yeah.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.740
So this is like your
q1 and your q1, right?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.153
Your charge 1 and
your charge 2 over?

00:11:58.153 --> 00:11:59.070
STUDENT: The distance.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.910
PROFESSOR: The distance squared.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.450
Let's call that the distance
between the two particles.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.570
And so now we can say if
this is the distance away

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.340
in the x direction,
then we know that r is

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.980
root x squared plus b squared.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.400
So we can stick that
in there, and we

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:25.490
know that our Coulomb force
would then be this k0 little z

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.550
e squared over root--

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:34.363
I'm sorry not square root,
just x squared plus b squared.

00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:35.780
So like we've done
with everything

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.000
so far in the class--

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.675
it's kind of dark in the back.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.550
Like we've done with
everything in the class,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.080
let's split this up
into x and y-forces.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.990
So if we assume that
the electron basically

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.350
doesn't move, what's
the net amount

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.080
of force in the x direction
that this particle is

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.690
going to feel when it
goes from minus infinity,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.100
so over here, to plus
infinity like over here.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.943
STUDENT: Zero.

00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:58.610
PROFESSOR: Zero.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.443
Why do you say that?

00:12:59.443 --> 00:13:02.900
STUDENT: Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.100
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.830
Whatever force it feels
repelling it from here,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.530
as soon as it hits
this midpoint,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.972
it gets that same
amount of propulsion

00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:12.930
in the other direction.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.610
So your net force, if you
integrate from minus infinity

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:22.340
to infinity, of your x
force as a function of t,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.310
that comes out to zero, which
makes our life a lot easier.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.100
All we have to worry about
is the total integral

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.760
of the y force to figure out
how much net deflection do

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.770
we get in that direction.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:38.640
This integral is also
better known as a momentum.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.510
Anyone recognize where
with this comes from?

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.070
If you take the
integral of a force,

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.770
it's like the integral of a mass
times an acceleration, which

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.230
is like mass times the
integral of acceleration, which

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.610
is like mv, which is a
momentum this is where some

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.700
of our particle wave stuff
is going to get funky,

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.250
because we're going to start
throwing in expressions

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.835
for particle momentums
in wave equations

00:14:04.835 --> 00:14:06.960
when we start to determine,
well, if this is really

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.070
an electron.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.335
There's some limitations
on how we can treat it,

00:14:10.335 --> 00:14:12.460
where it kind of loses its
character as a particle.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.370
So I just want to warn
you that that's coming up.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.950
So now, let's make an
expression for the y force.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.130
If we were to say what is the
y momentum imparted, which

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.645
is an integral of the y
component of the force dt,

00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.520
we already have the
expression for the force,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.630
like you guys derived.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.930
K0 time as little
ze times e over r

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:42.225
squared, which is x
squared plus b squared.

00:14:42.225 --> 00:14:44.100
And then how do we get
the y component of it?

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.360
Well, we've got to
define an angle.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.023
That's our angle theta.

00:14:54.023 --> 00:14:55.565
What's the y component
of that force?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's just
times cosine theta dt.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.690
What's the expression
for cosine theta

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.590
in this physical situation?

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.500
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.230
PROFESSOR: Close.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.120
b over r.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.220
And in this case, r is root
x squared plus b squared.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.770
And the last thing we want is
because we have things in terms

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.850
of x and b, b's a
constant, x is a variable,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.930
t's kind of the wrong variable.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.500
So we can do a
variable change and say

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.380
this is equivalent to the
velocity of the particle over--

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:47.500
I'm sorry-- to dx over v. We're
just using this whole like

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.810
velocity equals, what is
it, distance times time,

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.234
so our whole, what is it--

00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:57.430
yeah.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.660
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.590
Distance equals velocity times.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.840
Thinks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.300
OK, anyway.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.977
So luckily, I had
the expression right

00:16:08.977 --> 00:16:10.060
and the explanation wrong.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.602
So thank you.

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.470
Was that Luke or Jared's voice?

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.970
Awesome.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:13.720
OK.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.850
So let's put this
whole expression in,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.438
keep that little
embarrassment behind us.

00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:20.980
We have the integral
from negative to

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:28.670
plus infinity of k0
little z e squared times b

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.067
over x squared plus
b squared times

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:33.150
the square root of itself.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:38.440
So let's just say x squared
plus b squared to the 3/2,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.930
and there's a v
on the bottom dx.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.030
This is finally valuable.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.568
So we're getting closer.

00:16:45.568 --> 00:16:47.360
Let's take all the
constants and shove them

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.070
outside the integral.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:17:00.090
So we have a k0 z squared eV
over b squared b over velocity

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:07.910
times the integral of
just 1 over x squared

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:13.310
plus b squared to the 3/2 dx.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.119
Not remembering the formula off
the top of my head, I-- yeah?

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.442
STUDENT: So we can treat
the velocity as a constant

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:20.329
even though it's losing energy.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.940
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's--
well, we'll call it a crude

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.537
derivation.

00:17:23.537 --> 00:17:25.579
But if we're assuming that
the electron basically

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.099
doesn't change position,
that it changes so little,

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.557
then we're going to assume that
also the velocity basically

00:17:30.557 --> 00:17:32.390
doesn't change,
that one collision

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.350
for a high enough velocity
doesn't lose that much energy.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.708
So that's what we're
going with for now.

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.250
And we'll actually
be able to compare

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.500
this kind of crude
derivation to one

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.378
done from quantum mechanics,
and they look pretty similar.

00:17:45.378 --> 00:17:47.420
There's like an extra
factor of two or something.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.000
But as I showed you guys in
preparing for the test, when

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.330
I said 9 equals about
10, it therefore

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.240
follows that 1 equals
about 2, and as long

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.640
as we get the constants and
orders of magnitude right,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.765
we're going to gain the
physical intuition for what

00:18:00.765 --> 00:18:01.640
we're looking at.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.190
I'll leave it up there.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.280
Anyway, evaluated this integral,
and it came out to something

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.710
like 2 over b squared.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:20.120
So this just comes out to k0
ze squared b with a 2 over 2 vb

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.530
squared.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.200
Cancel the b's.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.010
I don't know where
that 2 came from.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.510
Whatever.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.280
Yeah, that's what we
have for the stopping

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.270
power for this sort of one
particle hitting one electron.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.110
Now, we have-- well, sorry,
that's the momentum equation.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.602
But we're interested in
the change in energy.

00:18:43.602 --> 00:18:45.310
So what's that equation
we've used before

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.210
to go from momentum to energy?

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.820
Our kinetic energy t.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.560
STUDENT: Square root
of q [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:58.500
PROFESSOR: Other way around.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.950
So let's do it that way,
right, so p equals root 2 mT.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.680
OK, so square both sides.

00:19:09.272 --> 00:19:09.980
Yeah, you got it.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:20.410
And we have our energy
T is p squared over 2m.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:26.080
So let's take this small
little mess, stick it in here,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.710
and then we end up with 4k0
squared little z squared e

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:41.830
to the fourth over
2mv squared b.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.060
Cool.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.390
And so this gives us the little
differential energy change

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.560
from one electron collision.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.110
Yeah?

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.128
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:50.128 --> 00:19:52.170
PROFESSOR: I think we
cancel one of those, right?

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.480
STUDENT: Yeah, but then
when you square [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.250
PROFESSOR: Oh
yeah, you're right.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.600
Thank you.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.680
Comes back.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.790
b squared b squared.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:01.540
Yep, you're right.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.860
Thank you.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.680
So now we've only accounted
for the ion hitting

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.580
a single electron as it moves
through this hollow cylinder

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.180
of whatever medium
it's going through.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.380
So this is when we can kind of
take things back from abstract

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.370
to reality and say,
all right, it's moving

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.720
through some actual material.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.720
And we have to describe
its electron density

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.880
in this cylindrical shell.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.300
So the electron density in the
cylindrical shell depends on--

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.820
well, the number
density of the material

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:33.070
itself, just how many atoms
are there times big Z,

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.930
the number of protons
in that nucleus

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.530
and therefore the number of
electrons in each nucleus,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.885
and the volume of the
cylindrical shell.

00:20:40.885 --> 00:20:42.510
So what's the expression
for the volume

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.552
of the cylindrical shell?

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.120
In differential form?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.790
Yeah, I started hearing?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.540
I heard a 2.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.130
That's correct.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.630
Keep going.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.510
Well, 2 pi b gives
us the circumference

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.600
of the circle on the
outside of the cylinder.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.850
And if we add a little db there,
some differential thickness

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.680
element, and we add on a
little dx for some differential

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.920
distance down the
cylinder, we end up

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:27.290
with 2 pi b dv dx,
multiplied by this stuff.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.490
And we get some differential
change in energy scales like--

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.700
let's say there is
a 4 and a 2 there.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.620
So we end up with 4.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.580
That's not a 4.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:48.130
pi k0 squared, little
z squared, big Z

00:21:48.130 --> 00:22:01.690
e to the fourth b dv dx
over mv squared b squared.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.020
Now those other b's cancel.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.400
We can divide everything by dx.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.250
And we've already almost got
our stopping power expression.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.837
We're getting pretty close.

00:22:12.837 --> 00:22:14.670
Anyone see some
similarities between the one

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.220
I just threw out of my head
and what we've got so far?

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.220
We've almost got
the makings of it.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.020
So now if we want to
account for the fact

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.360
that our charged
particle is probably not

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.460
shooting through the center
of a perfect hollow cylinder,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.270
but we're just firing it
into like actual matter,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.340
we have to account for
every possible impact

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.200
parameter in every
possible cylindrical shell

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.360
that it would be moving through.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.638
So in this case, we
can integrate this.

00:22:44.638 --> 00:22:46.180
We've already got
our db right there.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.700
That's our integrating variable.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.030
And now here's where things
get a little tricksy.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:57.520
Can we actually integrate this
from an impact parameter of 0?

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.972
And this is not an
easy question actually.

00:23:03.972 --> 00:23:04.930
What do you guys think?

00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:09.100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.660
PROFESSOR: So Luke says no, why?

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.591
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.970
PROFESSOR: We actually
have an over b.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.950
We have a v squared, but that's
not our integrating variable.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.010
Yeah, so we have like
a 1 over b looking--

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.116
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:31.116 --> 00:23:32.324
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's fine.

00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:34.930
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.957
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.790
There's another more
physical reason though.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.960
But you're right mathematically.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.950
Can you know precisely the
location of an electron ever?

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.450
Now I see a lot of
people saying no.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.100
Why do you say that?

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.340
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.340
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.980
There's this thing-- the De
Broglie uncertainty principle.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.815
It's kind of the punchline of a
lot of quantum mechanics jokes.

00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:07.690
You never know where
something is going to be

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:08.720
or where it's going.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.200
We used to say this about
some of the older professors

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.580
in this department.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.320
If you call them and
say, I'm on my way,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.778
I'm getting there
as fast as I can,

00:24:15.778 --> 00:24:17.325
they could be
anywhere in the world.

00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:19.450
And if they say, don't
worry, I'm three miles away.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.040
You don't know how long it's
going to take them to get here.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.540
Same thing with me
and getting here.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.420
Although I was on
MIT standard time,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.980
which means five minutes late.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.240
Not bad.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.660
So in this case, we have
to ascribe the electron

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.398
some sort of a wavelength.

00:24:33.398 --> 00:24:35.440
So in this case, we can't
just treat the electron

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.320
like a particle whose
position we know.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.240
We're going to go with
our original equation

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.760
for a photon energy, which
looks like hc over lambda.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.520
Rearrange that so that we'll
have some lambda wavelength

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:54.810
equals hc over E.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:55.310
I'm sorry.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.320
This is a momentum thing,
not an energy thing.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.580
And what's the momentum
of the electron?

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.740
From the classical definition?

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.200
It's just mass times
velocity, right?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.260
So we'll just stick in
the mass of the electron

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.510
times the velocity right there.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.120
And this wavelength right
here, the De Broglie wavelength

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.210
of the electron is as close
as we can specify that impact

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.290
parameter.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.430
And it turns out to be pretty
significant, like on the order

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.170
of 0.1 to 0.2 angstroms.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.010
You can't tell where an electron
is going to be finer than that.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.710
So we're going to
have this b minimum.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:48.750
I'll just write that in
there and some b maximum,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:54.157
where are b minimum is
the same as our De Broglie

00:25:54.157 --> 00:25:55.740
wavelength of the
electron, because we

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.830
can't define its position
any better than that,

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.960
which is just Planck's constant
over its mass times velocity.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.620
For b max, it comes
out to something

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.780
like hv over this
quantity, I bar

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.426
what's called the mean
ionization potential.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.790
What this quantity
physically represents

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.180
is that if your impact
parameter is too large,

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.640
then the electron will--
or the charged particle

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.150
will feel so little force,
that it won't eject an electron

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.100
and won't really be deflected.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.460
And the farthest away
it can be corresponds

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.910
to the minimum amount of energy
to create an average ionization

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.670
in the material.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.710
And this mean ionization
potential scales

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.770
with something like
this constant k times

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:05.670
z, where k is on the
order of like 30 to 35--

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.530
think it's like eV.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:13.700
But remarkably tight constant,
so picking a mean value

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.240
like that is no problem.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.060
And there we have
our b min and b max.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.550
Those are our limits
of integration.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.610
I think I planned this just
to fill up the boards today.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.490
So let's write out the
final integral that we have

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.220
and see what we get.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.400
So we have our
stopping power, should

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:48.200
be integral from b min h over mv
to b max jv over I bar of 4 pi

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:54.860
k0 squared little z squared
big Ze to the fourth over mv

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.240
squared b db.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.910
And like I think it
was Sarah that you

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.953
mentioned that we'd have a log.

00:28:02.953 --> 00:28:04.120
I forget who's mentioned it.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.620
Sorry.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.548
That was Luke, OK?

00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:06.090
You're right.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.715
So it ends up just
being a natural log.

00:28:07.715 --> 00:28:10.980
It's like all this junk
on the outside times

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.810
the integral of 1 over b.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.960
So this just comes
out to 4 pi k0

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:22.570
squared little z squared
big Ze to the fourth over mv

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:32.570
square times the natural
log of dv max over b min.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.200
The h's cancel.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.550
We get a v squared.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.470
And so all this
stuff inside just

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:50.630
becomes the natural log of mv
squared over mean ionization

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.060
potential.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.190
And we've arrived basically
at the same equation

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.530
that we have over
there, that I took care

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.940
to memorize on the plane.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.490
So great that we've gotten
here through the math.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.195
Let's actually see
what this means,

00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:06.570
and we're going to go into
some of the limits of validity

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.050
like Luke was saying, where you
can't have a natural log of 0.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:14.520
So the stopping power formula
isn't quite going to work at 0.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.390
Nor will it work at
super low energies.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:23.000
So if you want to write what
this should be proportional to.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.500
I kind of see some constants
here that we don't really care.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.060
They don't vary at all.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.480
But this looks kind of
like a kinetic energy term,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.920
doesn't it?

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.190
Like kinetic energy terms.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.290
So it's kind of proportional
to this function 1 over t

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.958
times the natural log of t.

00:29:40.958 --> 00:29:42.500
When you get rid of
all the constants

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.600
and just express it in
terms of the variables,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.420
it looks a whole lot simpler.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.900
And so let's see what
this would look like if we

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.780
started to graph it out.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.080
And this is pretty universal
for any charged particle

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.400
stopping power.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.340
So if this was the
kinetic energy t,

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:07.690
and this was our stopping power,
we've got this 1 over T term

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.980
that's going to look
something like this.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.430
And we have this natural
log of T term, which

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.930
is going to look something like
this that actually goes down

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.448
to infinity.

00:30:19.448 --> 00:30:20.990
So like Luke was
saying, if these two

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.615
are multiplied by
each other, we're not

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:25.370
going to have negative infinity
as a stopping power, which

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.550
would physically mean that once
the particle hit zero energy,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.990
it speeds up to
infinite speed, and that

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.850
doesn't make any sense.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.510
But we can start to draw
what the curve would

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.550
look like with this
general envelope.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.970
And so at low energies, the
stopping power kind of scales

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.840
like 1 over e.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.490
Let's now start
drawing another graph

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.620
with a little more
physical intuition,

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.560
the range of the particle.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.060
So while stopping power might
be kind of a new quantity that

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.730
represents the differential
amount of energy lost

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.130
as a function of distance--
that's kind of a mouthful--

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:03.590
the range is pretty simple,
just how far it goes.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.825
So to get the range
from the stopping power,

00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:08.200
you can integrate--
let's say you

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.460
fire a particle into a bunch
of matter at some energy T.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.370
So you start off an energy
T, and you want to see

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:19.060
how far it gets at distance 0.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.890
Well, you can just
integrate the stopping power

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.840
as a function of T,
or you can switch

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.490
your limits of integration.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:31.850
Let's see.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:32.390
I'm sorry.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.515
I'm not going to switch
those limits of integration

00:31:34.515 --> 00:31:44.200
yet, which is like saying
from 0 to T of dt dx dt, which

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:55.182
is like saying from 0 to T
of dt dx to the minus 1 dx.

00:31:55.182 --> 00:31:57.107
Much simpler expression.

00:31:57.107 --> 00:31:58.940
And when you forget all
the crazy constants,

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.870
and you just take
this kind of form

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.033
as the variable part of the
expression for stopping power,

00:32:07.033 --> 00:32:08.450
unless your energy
is really high,

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:12.470
and this natural log counts at
all, your range kind of scales

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.880
like the integral
of just 1 over T.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.100
I'm sorry, that to
the minus 1, which

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.870
is like the integral of T,
which is like T squared, which

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.590
means that this are pretty
interesting intuitive result,

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.230
that the range of the
particle increases

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.898
with the square of its energy.

00:32:32.898 --> 00:32:34.440
So this gives you
a good hint to say,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.960
if I increase the particle
by a certain amount,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.010
I'll increase the range by the
square root of that increase.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.290
So anyway let's start
drawing this range

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.780
curve as a function of x.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.390
What this says right here is
that if we start our particle

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:54.400
at some high energy, and we're
firing into the material,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.650
and it's losing
energy as it goes,

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.010
and we track this value
of the stopping power

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:05.660
to figure out how far it's going
to go, change that in a second,

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.150
for the first little while
as this particle loses

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.010
more and more energy,
its stopping power

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.910
stays mostly constant, and it
loses a pretty constant amount

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.000
of energy as a function of time.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.970
As its energy gets
lower and lower,

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.420
it loses more and more as
a function of position.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.300
What this actually means is
that as the velocity goes down

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.700
or as the particle's
energy goes down,

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.170
it spends more time in the
vicinity of the electron

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:33.802
and gets deflected more.

00:33:33.802 --> 00:33:35.510
It's just that kind
of a simple argument.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.270
Like the more time it
spends near this electron,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.660
the more it feels the push.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.500
And so it will lose
more and more energy

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.490
as its energy gets lower and
lower until you hit the point

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.297
where this curve breaks down.

00:33:50.297 --> 00:33:51.630
Where do you guys think that is?

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.220
Even mathematically speaking.

00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:04.270
Well, what happens if your
natural log term is negative

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.495
here?

00:34:05.495 --> 00:34:07.120
Then you get a negative
stopping power,

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.850
which would be like the
particle picks up energy.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.489
That's not quite
physical at all.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.510
So in reality, we know
that at some point

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.739
it's going to taper off,
and the stopping power at 0

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:23.310
should be 0.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:28.880
This maximum right here
occurs around 500 times

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.997
the mean ionization potential,
which is a pretty low energy,

00:34:31.997 --> 00:34:34.580
but what this actually says is
that when the particle's moving

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.000
really slow, it's moving so
slow that once in a while,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.219
it will capture one
of those electrons,

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:44.690
like if you fire in a proton or
a positively charged heavy ion,

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.090
if it's moving so slow
that it can feel the pull,

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.580
it will just
partially neutralize.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.929
And that becomes the next
mechanism of energy loss.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.150
And so if we keep following
this curve, once we

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.850
hit some sort of a
maximum, then it's

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.430
going to lose less and
less and less energy,

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.120
do less and less damage, and
you end up with the same curve,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.140
this kind of brag peak
curve that we did together

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.330
when we used the SRIM code.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.050
Did I go through the stopping
range of ions in matter

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.670
with you guys?

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.550
Did I show you
this on the screen?

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.120
Remember the curve of the--

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.310
let's say damage events
per distance or number

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.390
of implanted ions as a
function of distance.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.270
You end up with the
exact same thing.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.770
That's what the SR stands
for in SRIM is stopping,

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.270
what is it, stopping power and
range or something like that.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.230
Something range of
ions and matter.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.510
Is it the stopping power and
range of ions and matter?

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.750
I don't know, but all SRIM
is a gigantic stopping power

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.510
database and a big
Monte Carlo engine.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.270
So it takes an equation
just like this one or--

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.400
yeah, just like
this one, that one,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.025
whichever one you want
and decides, well,

00:36:00.025 --> 00:36:01.650
how often is the
particle going to lose

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:06.070
how much energy depending
on where it happens to be?

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.910
And that's all there is to it.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.430
This point here, we
would call the range

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.040
or like the average range
at which-- well, that's

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.820
not quite right.

00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:19.840
There'd be some average
range around here

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.670
where the particles
actually stop,

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.620
when their energy goes to zero.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.380
And in reality, because
every one of these processes

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.020
is random in nature,
the impact parameter

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.580
is going to be kind of random.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.250
Not every particle will
stop at the same place,

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.710
because all the electrons are
moving around in the atoms.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:40.980
So there's going to be some
sort of a range of ranges, which

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:46.430
we call straggling,
which is to say

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.310
that not all of the particles
end up at the exact same range,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:53.250
but they end up pretty close.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.000
I think I want to pause
here for a seconds

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.110
and see if there's any
questions from this four board

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.330
derivation or any
intuition questions

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.110
that you guys might have.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.040
Yeah.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.620
STUDENT: You didn't initially
have the negative d2 over dx.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.650
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah,
where'd that go?

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.790
Let's trace this through.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:09.415
STUDENT: What happened
to the negative?

00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:11.350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.335
STUDENT: But we didn't
actually derive it.

00:37:15.335 --> 00:37:16.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's see.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.230
So the change in
energy should have been

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.600
a negative change in energy.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.120
So if we-- it went
missing there.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.150
So there we go.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.270
That's the only other place
that seems to be missing.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.106
OK, great.

00:37:37.106 --> 00:37:38.445
Cool.

00:37:38.445 --> 00:37:40.820
Then if you want to start
looking at the number of damage

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:45.140
events that this
particle will incur,

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.090
we'll call this the
number of ion pairs, which

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.400
might look suspiciously
familiar if you guys remember

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.200
the Chadwick paper,
he was talking

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.410
about this proton of this
energy should make this many ion

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.970
pairs at this distance.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.470
Now you guys actually
have the tools

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.110
to find out what that
number should be,

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:09.310
because it's going to be 1
over some ion pair energy,

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:16.150
usually around 30 to 35 eV,
depending on the material times

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.830
dt vx, which is to say when
the stopping power is higher,

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.930
you're going to have
more ion pairs produced

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.850
as a function of distance.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.250
So the real label
for this y-axis

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:36.630
here should be like ion pairs
or damage or defects or anything

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.090
like that that refers to the
same kind of thing as damages

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.360
to the material, either
by ionization or even

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.383
by similar nuclear processes.

00:38:46.383 --> 00:38:48.050
And so that's what
results in those SRIM

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.490
curves that we showed from
before, where you have,

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.550
let's say, a bunch of protons
entering a material here

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.290
at some high energy.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.100
They don't lose very much
energy when they go in,

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.440
but as soon as they get
to a low enough energy

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.840
where they're stopping
power reaches the maximum,

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.590
they dump most of
their energy in there.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.620
And this is the basis behind
proton cancer therapy, which

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.350
I mentioned to you guys in the
first or second day of class.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.560
Now that we know both
exponential attenuation

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.250
and stopping power, we
can explain theoretically

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.500
why proton therapy is a
more effective treatment.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.930
So let's say this is the
person that contains a tumor.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.470
Say it's right there.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:35.670
And you have a choice
between firing in an X-ray

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.430
or firing in a proton.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.920
What is the dose to this
person, not just to the tumor,

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.760
but through the whole person
going to look like for X-rays?

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.650
Get another board.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.630
So if we look at the number
of ion pairs, and let's

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:58.300
say this is the
thickness of the person,

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.230
and the tumor is in this range.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:08.830
And if you send in
your X-rays, or you

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:12.130
send in your protons,
what is the number of ion

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.980
pairs produced from X-ray
or from proton going

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.488
to look like in either case?

00:40:16.488 --> 00:40:18.280
So first of all, who
wants do the X-ray one

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.405
or tell me what it will be?

00:40:24.623 --> 00:40:25.540
You guys-- yeah, Luke?

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.970
STUDENT: Would it
be pretty flat?

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.720
PROFESSOR: It'll be
fairly flat, but there

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.020
would be some decay to it.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.880
So let's say we defined some
initial intensity, X-rays just

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.890
get attenuated exponentially.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.790
So you're going to do a whole
lot of damage to the person

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.700
before the X-rays
reach the tumor, which

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.280
is why when you
do X-ray therapy,

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.880
you have to send in x-rays from
a bunch of different locations

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.080
so that the tumor
gives out the most,

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.020
and the rest of the
person in any location

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.780
doesn't get that much dose.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.730
For proton therapy,
it's quite different.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.673
It looks just like this.

00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:01.840
So you might do a little
bit of damage as you go in,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.787
and you tune the energy
of those protons,

00:41:06.787 --> 00:41:08.620
so that they do all the
damage in the tumor,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.548
and then they stop in the
tumor or just beyond it,

00:41:11.548 --> 00:41:13.090
so that they don't
do any more damage

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.310
to the rest of the person, and
they do very little going in.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.190
And so that's why
proton therapy centers

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.930
are popping up
all over the world

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:21.950
because it's a more
effective treatment.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:27.512
It's also more expensive because
you need a proton accelerator

00:41:27.512 --> 00:41:28.970
so then, here's a
question for you.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:33.390
This is something they
actually do in the lab.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.820
Say, here's your human.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.900
There's your tumor.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:44.110
There is your proton
gun at a fixed 250 MeV,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.610
firing protons out.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.960
How do you change the
range of those protons

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.210
without changing their energy?

00:41:52.965 --> 00:41:54.590
STUDENT: The distance
it has to travel?

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.110
PROFESSOR: Is what?

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:56.900
STUDENT: The distance it
has to travel the other way.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.420
PROFESSOR: The distance it
has to travel specifically?

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.790
I mean, if they travel in a
vacuum, do they lose energy?

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:03.290
No.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.420
So what can you do?

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.545
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:07.835 --> 00:42:09.210
PROFESSOR: You
could deflect them

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.620
and change their direction.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.580
But as we'll get into on
Tuesday, if you deflect them,

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.180
they're going to
emit lots of X-rays

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.430
in the form of Bremmstrahlung.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.040
So that's probably not
what we want to do.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.630
You can put stuff--

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.690
and I can't be any more
specific than that--

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.720
in between the proton
beam and the patient,

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.950
because if the stopping power
for 250 MeV protons and 50 MeV

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.320
protons basically
doesn't change,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.150
then you just put
things in the way.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.595
So let's say this is the
thickness of the person.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.650
You just put some
tissue equivalent stuff,

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.100
or what they'll call a phantom,
so some tissue equivalent gel

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.220
or water or some other
stuff to lower the proton

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.220
energy without deflecting
the beam that much.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.860
So as you guys saw in
the SRIM simulation,

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.430
if you track the 3D
positions of these protons

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.880
as they enter into the material,
they all go pretty straight,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.550
and then they start
getting funny.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.550
Computer can fly the
ions faster than I can.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.650
But no matter what
it goes through here,

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.220
while the protons
have high energy,

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.890
they don't get
deflected much, they

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.600
don't lose that much energy.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.620
And you can very finely tune
the amount of stuff in the way.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.010
This would be the stuff section
before entering the person.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.330
So this is why it's so useful.

00:43:35.962 --> 00:43:37.420
So let me check
the time, because I

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.000
haven't checked at all.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.060
The clock's broken.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.420
Oh, we have like 10 minutes.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.060
So now is a good time
to stop for questions

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.940
and see if you guys have any
questions from the derivation

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.030
or the sort of physical meaning
of stopping power and matter.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:56.300
Yeah.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.540
STUDENT: What was the
nz sort of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:11.182
PROFESSOR: Yes, the nz, n is
the number density of atoms.

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.640
So if you're traveling through
some actual block of matter,

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.500
it depends how many
atoms are in the way.

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:21.830
So if the total stopping power
decreases with decreasing

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.410
density, like if you're
going through tungsten,

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.410
but it happens to be a tungsten
gas, that tungsten gas will not

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.470
have nearly as much stopping
power as tungsten metal,

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.680
because there's just more
tungsten than the weight.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.460
Or less, I'm sorry.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:39.890
And the z right here
is the charge per atom,

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.500
to say if you're firing
electrons into something,

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.947
the strength of
the Coulomb force

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:46.280
that they'll feel, or let's
say, the number of electrons

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:50.030
that they can smack into is the
same with the number of protons

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.110
in that nucleus if we're
not using ionized materials.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.210
And we're typically
not firing anything

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.290
into ionized materials.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.710
It's just normal neutral matter.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.352
Does that make more sense?

00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:03.570
Cool.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:04.810
Yeah, Luke.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.618
STUDENT: Where did that n go?

00:45:07.618 --> 00:45:09.160
PROFESSOR: It should
have been there.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.320
Thank you.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.755
pi n.

00:45:13.755 --> 00:45:14.880
Should absolutely be there.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.290
Anything else?

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.910
Yeah, Dan.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:23.756
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:23.756 --> 00:45:25.390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.680
PROFESSOR: The
charge per atom is

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.130
big Z. The charge
on the particle

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.320
is little z, because both
of them actually matter.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.950
So little z tells
you the strength

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.220
of the interaction between the
particle and each electron.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.730
Big Z tells you how many
electrons are there per atom.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.720
Big N tells you how many
atoms are in the way.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.720
And in that way, you have
a complete description

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.530
of the material.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.170
Curious that the mass
of the charged particle

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:56.290
is absent from this formula.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.390
Isn't it?

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.220
Yeah.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.280
The mass doesn't matter.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.190
You will certainly
change the momentum of,

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.320
let's say, a charged
particle less.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.250
But in the end, it's just
non-contact Coulomb forces

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.230
that determine the
energy transfer

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.810
between the electrons in there
and the charged particles

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.730
slowing down in the medium.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.680
So that is a curious thing to
look at, but it is intentional.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.110
For the case of this ionization
or electronic stopping power,

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:30.250
the mass does not enter into
it at least in this formula.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.220
There is another version
derived that's in your reading

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.380
that they just kind of
plop it in front of you

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.720
that's got the mass somewhere
in the natural long term

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.095
somewhere where
it really doesn't

00:46:39.095 --> 00:46:41.845
change much at all, except
for really high energies.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.160
So if you want to
think about, well,

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.130
what do I want you
to know, I would

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.340
want you to be able to go
through this derivation again,

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.670
so that I can know you can
go from a intuitive example

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.520
to an actual equation
you can use, graph

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.010
what that equation
should look like and talk

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:05.210
about where it really matters
and where it breaks down.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.750
Like mathematically speaking,
if this natural long term

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.110
is negative, you're not going to
have a negative stopping power.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:15.560
Something else has got to
occur, and what's happening here

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.640
is neutralization.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.720
And that's why the stopping
power curve diverges

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.470
for really low energies,
because sometimes

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:28.428
electrons get captured.

00:47:31.817 --> 00:47:33.400
Any other questions
on stopping power?

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:39.320
Cool.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.220
This is a good place
to stop for now.

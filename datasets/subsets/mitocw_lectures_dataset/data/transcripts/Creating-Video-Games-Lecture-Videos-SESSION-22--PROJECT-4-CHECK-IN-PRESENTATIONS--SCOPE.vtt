00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.160
PROFESSOR: Schedule for the
remainder of the semester.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.090
Today is a short week.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
Normal day today, slightly
different day on Wednesday.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.180
I'll talk about that
in the lecture today.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.910
Basically we hope to have the
official class ended by 2:00pm.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.630
So 1:00 to 2:00 will
be class on Wednesday.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.040
After 2:00, working
in your groups

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.230
or taking off early if
you need to take off early

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.414
for a flight or whatnot.

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:55.080
So it's up to your
teams, whether or not

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.990
you're working in here
or not on Wednesday.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.890
This is also going to be
the last lecture by us,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.590
I believe, on the schedule.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.890
Next week we've got
two guest lectures.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.539
One, on December 1
we've got a panel

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:11.830
from the Indie Game Collective.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.413
They're going to be talking to
us about the business of making

00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:15.880
Indie games.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.070
Two people who have their own
businesses, their own studios,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.760
and how their studios
work together.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.830
So that should be
interesting for you.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.230
And then on December 3,
on that Wednesday, we

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.870
have Sean Baptiste from
Fire Hose Games talking

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.080
to us on marketing,
communication, and community

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.850
management for games.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.280
Because we're seeing you can't
just put out a PR release

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.040
and buy some
advertising, you need

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.820
to build a community if you're
making games professionally.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.736
You need to find your
players, because there's

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:49.190
lots of games they could be
playing besides your own.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.330
So he'll be talking
to us about that.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.810
The week after that
is entirely based

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.610
around your presentations.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.670
So December 8 is a rehearsal
in class, live reversal

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.420
with your game.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.070
If your game works on
that date-- hopefully

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.259
it will-- but
definitely your slides

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.381
and your spoken presentation.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.880
We will give you feedback, you
will then take that feedback,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.650
improve your presentation,
improving your grade,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.340
and give it as the final
presentation on Wednesday,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.890
December 10.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.250
At the end of the class on
December 10 it'll be open play.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.990
So after all the
presentations are over

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.532
we're going to have
some guests here.

00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:30.990
You'll be able to
open your laptops

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.560
and play each other's games and
have guests play your games.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.740
So that should be
fun and exciting,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.350
and maybe a little
scary, which is good.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.239
So plans for today then.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.280
I got caught on that--
not 5 minute, but 2 minute

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.870
presentations.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.750
Basically short,
informal presentation

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.290
just like we did a few
weeks ago, I believe.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.750
We'd like to know about the
status of your game, what

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.250
features you're working
on, what features are not

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.200
being worked on right
now, what features

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.000
might be dropped and cut, and
I'd also like to see your game.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.920
So if you have got
one person talking,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.180
maybe another person showing the
game, maybe playing the game.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.060
This could be what the
game looks like today.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.610
This could be the version of
the game you tested last week,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.419
but have something
show-able, something

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.460
visual for us to see so
that we can-- when you're

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.127
talking about your
game we understand

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:26.210
what you're talking about.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.530
With no slides, of course,
for this presentation.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.820
For presentation on
8th-- on the 10th

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.459
that is more formal,
slides, all the good stuff.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.250
There's a description
about that in Stellar

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.470
and we'll talk more
about that next Monday.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.810
After that I'm going to
give a short, about 30

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.260
minute, lecture on
cutting features,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.730
some strategies on how to
do it, why you should do it,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.480
things like that.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.250
Might be obvious,
may not be obvious.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.450
After that is work in class.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.771
Pablo is here to give you
feedback on your games,

00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.020
so we'll be giving you
feedback on your presentations.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.100
If we have questions about
what you just talked about,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.830
but also he'll be going
around and available for each

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.955
of your teams to talk about
the status of your game

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:13.340
and what's going
on with your game.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.800
That is class today.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.593
Any questions?

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.870
All right.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.300
So it is 1:10.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.070
Are all the teams feel ready
to give presentations right now

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.619
or do you need a couple minutes?

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:29.017
AUDIENCE: Couple minutes.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:30.100
PROFESSOR: Couple minutes?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.445
All right.

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:31.986
So we're going to
give you 5 minutes.

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:34.270
1:15 I'm going to come
back up here and Snap

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.519
is going to start.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:37.435
TEJ CHAJED: All right.

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:38.409
Hi everybody.

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:39.870
I'm Snap-- I'm from Snap.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.331
I am not Snap.

00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.100
I'm Tej.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.690
And so we've made a lot
of progress on our game

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.820
and we've been able
to run it a few times,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.270
but it has not changed a lot
since probably anybody who's

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.920
played the game has seen it.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.840
So I'll just go ahead and
play one round of the game

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.090
just to show off what we
currently have, and then I'll

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.350
talk a little bit
about what we're

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.650
planning to do in the future.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.430
So everybody from the
team, you want to play?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.025
And can somebody start the game?

00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:15.995
AUDIENCE: I got it.

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.260
TEJ CHAJED: All right so the
way this game works is we're

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.530
going to throw out a topic.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.980
In this case it's animals.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.972
We're all going to try
to enter as many animals

00:05:25.972 --> 00:05:28.430
as we can think of, and we'll
get points whenever two of us

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.380
enter the same animal.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.240
All right.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.152
And they can obviously
all cheat, but let's--

00:05:34.152 --> 00:05:35.610
AUDIENCE: Wait, we
already started?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.776
TEJ CHAJED: Yes, we started.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.170
Obviously I would not be
showing this normally.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.099
This is a little bit
easy to cheat on.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:50.974
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.880
TEJ CHAJED: Although we've had
some other forms of cheating.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.399
When Andrew was here,
they just entered A, B, C,

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.565
in a row next to each other.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.957
Anybody want to help?

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:18.540
AUDIENCE: Cow.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.620
TEJ CHAJED: Cow.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.870
I guess this is also cheating.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:24.822
AUDIENCE: Lemur.

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:26.304
Snail.

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:29.268
AUDIENCE: Scorpion.

00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:30.750
AUDIENCE: Amoeba.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.232
AUDIENCE: Jaguar.

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:33.714
AUDIENCE: Chicken.

00:06:33.714 --> 00:06:34.613
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:34.613 --> 00:06:35.196
AUDIENCE: Pig.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:36.184
AUDIENCE: Paramecium.

00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:37.371
AUDIENCE: Veal.

00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:37.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.286
TEJ CHAJED: Veal
is not an animal.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.126
I guess baby deer is.

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:47.114
AUDIENCE: Geese.

00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:47.614
Human.

00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:53.450
TEJ CHAJED: All right.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.825
So I think that
gives you an idea

00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:56.530
of how this game plays out.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.412
Can somebody stop the game?

00:06:58.412 --> 00:07:00.720
AUDIENCE: I got it.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.722
TEJ CHAJED: So
right now we have--

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.011
AUDIENCE: [? Yes. ?]

00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:06.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.000
TEJ CHAJED: So right now
we have the game completely

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.980
manually controlled.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.420
And this is because current use
case-- in our current use cases

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.140
for the client
we've been playing

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.140
the game with a limited
number of words input

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.260
and without a time limit.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.830
So we let the client
just implement

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.205
whatever time they want by
starting and stopping the game

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.510
appropriately.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.200
But we plan on also supporting
an actual strict word

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.040
limit as well as a natural
time limit that can

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.150
be displayed on the front end.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.999
We initially went
with Phaser because we

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.540
had a much different idea of
how we would represent the game.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.750
But we ended up
focusing more on words

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.726
and, like, a more
bare-bones representation.

00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:48.600
And so we're actually
going to remove Phaser.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.370
Right now this is
a Phaser window,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.100
but it's not really
helping us at all.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.190
We're just entering
words into a list.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.960
So we're dropping all
of that and moving

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.420
to just normal CSS, HTML.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.800
We are also planning on-- we've
experimented in our thought

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.000
processes about
what sorts of ways

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.150
we want to show
scores and activity.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.275
We want to be able to show not
just what words you're scoring

00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:15.760
and submitting, but also when
are other people submitting

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.926
words, when are other people
scoring, how am I doing

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:19.540
relative to everyone else.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.490
So we have a couple
ideas around that.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.950
We also would like to show
you a word cloud in real time.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.730
We currently have a word
cloud for the back end.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.760
So this is the game
we just played.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.110
And this is a-- and
this is something

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.270
that you can watch
actually as a moderator,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.090
while you're playing,
in real time.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.140
And then here's
another game which

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.500
is an actual game that the
client ran in Berlin a week

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.657
or so ago.

00:08:47.657 --> 00:08:49.920
So that was kind of
cool that we actually

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.510
were able to do a real
playtest with the actual client

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.138
in the real world.

00:08:56.138 --> 00:08:57.846
But in the future we
definitely want this

00:08:57.846 --> 00:09:00.800
to look more interesting and
to feel more competitive.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.445
We want people to be able
to see what else is going on

00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:05.695
in the game, whereas right
now you really can only see

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:06.200
your scores.

00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:10.295
Any questions?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] questions
or comments, [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:18.620
AUDIENCE: What's your
biggest risk right now?

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.802
Like, what's the thing
that's most catastrophic?

00:09:21.802 --> 00:09:23.510
TEJ CHAJED: I think
since we're switching

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:28.580
the front end over to sort
of new technology we need

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.250
to make sure that a, that
transitions over well,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.530
and b, that we have enough
time to finish something

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.960
new and useful rather
than just reverting back

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.920
to what we have now.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.530
AUDIENCE: How does Snap happen?

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.390
TEJ CHAJED: So we
have a server that

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.810
is receiving all the words.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.610
And whenever it gets
a word it adds it

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.190
to a list of words for a player.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.160
And then every time
it gets a word it also

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.190
checks against all other lists.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.440
AUDIENCE: So it's
basically any other player

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.790
types the same word?

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.510
TEJ CHAJED: Yes.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.960
In the same game.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.610
So for example, the
game is now over.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.300
If you started a
new game, that's

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.720
an independent word list.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.830
Yeah?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.310
AUDIENCE: Just for curiosity,
so let's say you put in "dog"

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.790
and [? Priam ?] put in "dog"
and then Sam put in "dog"--

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.960
TEJ CHAJED: Everybody
gets one point right now.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.930
We're thinking of
changing that and letting

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.985
people get more than
one point, or maybe even

00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:24.230
making it configurable.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.987
Most likely--
intuitively it seems

00:10:25.987 --> 00:10:28.570
that you should get more if more
people have entered the word.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.638
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:10:33.638 --> 00:10:34.634
TEJ CHAJED: All right.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:39.116
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:39.116 --> 00:10:43.598
PROFESSOR: Next up
is Awesome Cholera.

00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:46.586
Yes, that is not the real title.

00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:50.830
PABLO: While Awesome Cholera
or other real title shows up,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.920
we will have a long
conversation about details,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.122
but I'm very excited
about the fact

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.830
that it's already
being used and working.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.690
And now the question
will be how many features

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.780
you want available to
the [INAUDIBLE] player.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.780
And that selection
process will be

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.965
based on both client need,
playtesting, and also

00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:14.030
your ambition on how much can
be accomplished in this time.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.727
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:14.727 --> 00:11:16.435
STUDENT 1: Do you want
to do the talking?

00:11:16.435 --> 00:11:17.400
STUDENT 2: Yeah.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.860
So this was the last build
to the game we playtested.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.350
We hadn't changed a lot.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.280
We tried to add
instructions so that people

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.686
kind of knew what was going on.

00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:26.810
And this is running, right?

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.590
Can you click Start?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.370
So right now this is what people
saw. they saw their villages,

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.220
and some health bars.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.490
It was still kind of unclear.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.580
And over here you can see, like,
the text is still really small.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.810
And when people
clicked something

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.430
to do education or
something they either

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.360
thought that, like, when
they clicked that button

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.551
it instantly did it.

00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:49.050
They didn't know
that was a button--

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.550
like Educate About Soap was
a button they could click.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.450
Also we had this really
terrible pop-up bug

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.986
that we're still trying to fix,
but hopefully that'll be fixed.

00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:00.580
And so because we were having
so many problems with the GUI

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.610
we finally sat down and
tried to redesign it.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.770
And so I haven't actually--
we haven't done this yet,

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.010
but here are some really
great drawings-- A plus,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.140
I said-- of what the
new GUI will have.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.050
So above each locality we're
going to have this little box.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.450
I kind of stole
it from [? Civ ?]

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.510
and a few other
places, but-- So it's

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.320
going to have the
name of the locality.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.690
And it's even worse
because it's going

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.970
to look different from what this
is because we've already talked

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.540
about how we want to change it.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.220
And so behind the work
locality is going to be a bar,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.190
and the bar is going
to have a percentage

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.694
green and a percentage red.

00:12:34.694 --> 00:12:36.652
And the percentage green
will be the percentage

00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:38.575
of people in that
locality that are healthy,

00:12:38.575 --> 00:12:39.991
and the red will
be the percentage

00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:41.636
of people that are unhealthy.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.066
Above that-- sorry.

00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:46.690
Above the word Locality, there's
a little arrow that represents

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.850
the infection rate,
which is something--

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.144
a lot of people used that
word and thought that was

00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:53.310
the information they were
getting, but they weren't.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.692
They were getting the
percentage of people infected.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.233
And so a lot of
people wanted to know

00:12:57.233 --> 00:12:59.700
how's the infection
rate being changed.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.200
And so we're going
to have an arrow.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.964
And right now it's just going to
be, like, up if it's positive,

00:13:03.964 --> 00:13:04.880
down if it's negative.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.005
But we want to also change
it so that they can tell

00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:08.672
the magnitude of that as well.

00:13:08.672 --> 00:13:10.130
But we're also
trying to keep it so

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.588
that people aren't getting too
many numbers thrown at them.

00:13:12.588 --> 00:13:14.820
So we're still trying
to iron that one out.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.760
Below the Locality
are a bunch of symbols

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.070
representing the different
things you can do.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.570
What we thought we
were going to do

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.230
is if you've implemented them
they'll be there in color,

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.860
and they'll be counting down
so you know how much longer

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.520
that will be in effect.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.970
And they'll also have a gold
ring around them or something

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.386
to say, like, if you've educated
[? them ?] about it which

00:13:37.386 --> 00:13:39.611
means it's more effective.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.030
And then the other
screen is the screen

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.520
you get when you click-- there
will be a little thing that

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.490
says Aid Locality above
the Locality thing

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.320
for each of the
different localities.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.861
And over [? on this ?] screen--
[? which ?] [? got kind of ?]

00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:54.640
messy-- but it'll show all
the things you can do instead

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.260
of just the ones
that are unlocked,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.900
because a lot of people didn't
know that things unlocked over

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.420
time.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.394
So we'll have it
showing everyone,

00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:03.560
hey, these are all the
things and they'll eventually

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.860
unlock, either over time or
if you do a certain thing.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.124
And there will be
two columns, one

00:14:10.124 --> 00:14:11.290
for educate and for prevent.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.720
And as you mouse over everything
on the right-hand side

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.920
of the screen, the
description will come up

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.430
telling you about the
effectiveness and the duration,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.757
and giving you a description
of what it's doing.

00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:22.590
We're hoping that this'll
make it more clear

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.451
as to what everything's
doing, and it'll

00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:27.400
be easy to read chunks.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.190
So if they want to
know more about it

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.190
they can mouse over it
and just kind of read it.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.170
Or if not they can just
kind of quickly say,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.180
hey, this is pretty
effective but the duration's

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.900
short so I'll just use this
for a bit because it's cheaper

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.860
and then maybe I'll
use the thing that's

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.943
even more effective and
has a longer duration when

00:14:42.943 --> 00:14:45.580
I have more money.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.120
The other thing on the
map that I didn't scan yet

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.240
is, on the map, on
the very top of it,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.240
we're going to have a bar that
tells you about what day it is

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.100
and when you're getting
money, because a lot of people

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.155
were like, why am
I getting money?

00:14:58.155 --> 00:14:59.750
And they didn't know
time was passing.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.500
So we want to make all
these things clear.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.760
And so I think the GUI
redesign will help with that.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.280
Hopefully we should have
it done after Thanksgiving.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.070
But yeah.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.945
That's where we're at right now.

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.879
Any questions?

00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:17.324
PABLO: I have one,
but you guys first.

00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:18.614
Anybody?

00:15:18.614 --> 00:15:19.280
STUDENT 2: Yeah.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.790
AUDIENCE: Is your goal for
people to win this game

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.450
and then have done
the right things?

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.920
Or is it for them
to lose the game

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.686
and then, based on that know
what the right thing they

00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:29.707
should have done is?

00:15:29.707 --> 00:15:31.540
STUDENT 2: Right now
the game's really hard,

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.190
and it ends up you kind of lose
if you just leave it alone,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.356
which is not what we wanted.

00:15:35.356 --> 00:15:39.480
STUDENT 1: As you saw, earlier,
it just went to game over.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.890
STUDENT 2: We want them to
realize the different things

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.370
they can do.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:48.090
I don't think it's going to be
superbly challenging right now,

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.290
is what I'm imagining.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.289
Because you don't want
people to do these things

00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:52.874
and then be like,
oh, these things

00:15:52.874 --> 00:15:55.040
obviously don't work because
I keep losing the game.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.456
We want them to know that,
like, hey, if I do these things

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.394
it will help.

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:00.310
And so that's what we're
trying to get across.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.160
STUDENT 1: Another idea I think
that we're not communicating

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.440
effectively but [? is ?]
[? an ?] idea we also want

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.490
to communicate is that
the position on the map is

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:06.990
important.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.100
So like if the village
is-- upstream villages--

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.310
stuff you do there compounds
to the downstream villages

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.170
just because, like, the water,
you know-- if you're not

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.620
treating the water correctly
in an upstream village

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.280
that water is going to
be contaminated down

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.370
to the downstream village.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.870
And at the end we also want to
communicate through this game

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.692
is that, like, if you focus
on the upstream villages

00:16:25.692 --> 00:16:27.900
you'll have better results
in the long-term because--

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.770
AUDIENCE: So I guess how
would I discover that?

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.800
Is that just playing the
game many, many times?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.060
STUDENT 1: Exactly.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.018
So that's something we
have yet to communicate.

00:16:34.018 --> 00:16:36.435
And we should figure out
a way to communicate that

00:16:36.435 --> 00:16:39.020
to the audience.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.720
PABLO: So thank you.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.802
Good luck reconfiguring
the things

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.010
that need to be reconfigured.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.800
My intuition is that you would
be better off [? amputating ?]

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.755
choice, and leaving somewhere
very visible [? other ?] that

00:16:54.755 --> 00:16:57.213
says, these are other things
that could be done but are not

00:16:57.213 --> 00:16:58.370
represented in this game.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.500
Because otherwise it will
be just too [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.510
And unless you make
a really awesome game

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.290
that people want
to play and play

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.357
until they've tried everything,
it can be too intimidating.

00:17:07.357 --> 00:17:07.940
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.023
PABLO: One of the options
for your consideration--

00:17:10.023 --> 00:17:13.409
because right now you
have the options of soap

00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:17.939
and the latrines and vaccination
and so on-- you could reduce it

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:21.569
to the things that the
player, the macro-decider

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:25.130
could do in terms of
public awareness campaigns.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.339
So it could be about
[INAUDIBLE] the water,

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:31.555
about washing your
hands campaign and maybe

00:17:31.555 --> 00:17:32.480
one more thing.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.500
So limited to three things
that are of the same kind--

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.650
you know, radio advertisement or
sending people to [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.530
And maybe less villages.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.850
Again, just reduce choice.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.850
Reduce features so the gameplay
experience is more engaging.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.840
I just want you to
know this is also

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.540
applicable to the
other Cholera team.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.370
The Ghana team is now really
interested in promoting hand

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.490
washing because it's beneficial
both to cholera and to Ebola,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.330
which is a serious
threat in the area.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.277
So you are [? already know ?]
doing what you're doing

00:18:01.277 --> 00:18:03.860
and if hand washing does not fit
in the game, that's fine, OK?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.277
You are doing what we
asked you months ago,

00:18:06.277 --> 00:18:07.110
not what we say now.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.037
But if you find a
way to make hand

00:18:10.037 --> 00:18:12.340
washing fit as one
of the choices,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.490
it's much better than
having three vaccination

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.245
choices and two moving waste
choices and stuff like that.

00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:17.828
STUDENT 2: OK.

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:18.328
PABLO: Good.

00:18:18.328 --> 00:18:19.373
And good luck.

00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:20.248
STUDENT 1: Thank you.

00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:22.184
STUDENT 2: Yeah, thank you.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:27.508
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:28.980
PROFESSOR: Hello Waves.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.247
STUDENT 3: Our game
is called Hello Waves.

00:18:31.247 --> 00:18:32.830
We don't have the
title screen in yet,

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:37.810
but the idea is still
forecast-based financing.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.100
So it's a little
washed out on there.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.900
But if you can see there are
these five different sand

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.020
castles with workers
associated with each.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.630
And up here in corner
we have a forecast

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.570
of what the water level will
be like in a couple days.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.036
This is the water level right
here, and throughout the game

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:56.570
it'll rise and fall.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.750
And the idea is not to
let your workers get

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.737
drowned by the rising water.

00:19:01.737 --> 00:19:03.320
The other aspect of
the game though it

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.420
that you have a certain
amount of supplies

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.419
and whenever you move
someone from their castle

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:10.960
in order to prevent
them from getting

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.610
drowned, they will consume
supplies from that stock.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.380
And if you don't have
enough supplies then

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.300
they all take damage.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.017
So as you can see,
right now everybody's

00:19:21.017 --> 00:19:21.850
in their own castle.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.660
If we click Next Turn the
water level will change

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.980
and we'll see that the
forecast will update.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.750
We have a range of
values on this forecast,

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.634
a high prediction
and a low prediction,

00:19:32.634 --> 00:19:34.300
and if you mouse over
any of the castles

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.470
you'll see a red line
appear on the forecast

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.040
just to help you orient what
heights are on the forecast.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.860
Or if you're looking
at the forecast, what

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.680
it is in the real world.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.220
So you can see the water move.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.887
For these couple days right
now the forecast is pretty low.

00:19:49.887 --> 00:19:51.470
If we see that's
kind of getting close

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.886
and we're worried about someone
we can click and drag them

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:58.840
to another castle, and on the
next turn they'll move over.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.460
You can also click
people to toggle

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.459
between building and gathering.

00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.000
It's very hard to
see the status text

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.208
right now because it's small.

00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:07.550
We threw that in
quickly for right now.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.625
But he is set to
building and these three

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.000
are set to gathering.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.010
So we'll see that each
turn these three will

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.340
gather one supply each.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.290
This teddy bear
will consume one,

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.160
so we'll see supplies
go up by two,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.100
and victory progress
will go up by one.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.060
What we have planned
for the rest of the game

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.960
is we've made a lot
of progress in terms

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.290
of the intuitiveness of the
game, once you understand it,

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.850
but right now, there's a
lot in the game that isn't

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.600
explained from the get-go.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.240
And so if I give
that spiel to anyone

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.850
they can play the game fine
and they do pretty with it.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.760
But if you just open up
the game, you're lost.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.339
So a lot of our work is
going to be on the UI,

00:20:46.339 --> 00:20:48.100
of making things
more self-evident

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.240
and making sure that people
can understand what's going on

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.935
and what their actions
will do without me having

00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:55.650
to stand there and tell them.

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:00.060
PROFESSOR: Any questions?

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:03.980
All right.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.085
So I'm going to ask you again,
what is the biggest risk going

00:21:07.085 --> 00:21:09.294
forward?

00:21:09.294 --> 00:21:11.270
STUDENT 4: I mean,
I think in terms

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.870
of our technical
implementation we've already

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.750
got good playtests
of our work done

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.960
and we have, like, all
of our major graphics in

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.270
and things like that.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.500
So I think our major
risk going ahead

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.920
is not being able to
explain the game properly.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.670
And so even if we
have finished product

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.690
it may still not
be playable if we

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.222
don't write good introductions.

00:21:32.222 --> 00:21:33.150
PABLO: All right.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:39.010
So on that front think
of incremental additional

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.510
features.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.010
So the games with the
super simple, even

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.820
maybe too boring choices,
but then a new choice arrive.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.450
So the learning
be playing can be

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.620
staggered in a way that
is [? enjoyable ?].

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.120
Good.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.590
Good luck to you, and we'll
talk more about choices later.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.850
I should say that this
high versus low prediction

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.790
is something that I
wish scientists did,

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.540
like you're doing.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.460
Because most people
say one value,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.496
then it's not that
value [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:05.496 --> 00:22:07.948
earlier that
[INAUDIBLE] forecast.

00:22:07.948 --> 00:22:08.448
Good.

00:22:08.448 --> 00:22:09.924
Thank you.

00:22:09.924 --> 00:22:13.368
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:13.368 --> 00:22:15.830
PROFESSOR: Heat
Wave, come on down.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.390
STUDENT 5: So the main
things that Heat Wave

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.080
is focusing on right now are
playability and education.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.320
As you can see this
is our start screen.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.730
It doesn't have
any instructions.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.881
It's very lame.

00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:28.130
We're completely redoing that.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.040
We're also redoing our end
screen and our forecast screen

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.730
because we want visual
consistency and just

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.370
overall improved
playability by making

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.890
the gameplay states more
clear and more connected

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.830
to each other.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.070
The other thing we're working
on is we don't currently

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.410
have an explicit end condition.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.590
You kind of just play for
however you want to play,

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.990
and we're going to add in
like a something happens

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:55.146
that eventually too many
people faint, get heat stroke,

00:22:55.146 --> 00:22:56.520
the game's over,
so you have more

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.200
of an incentive to play well.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.380
And then finally something we're
working on is user investment.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.160
So we are actually--
where's my mouse?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160
Sorry.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.520
We are currently working
on redoing pretty much all

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.380
of our character
graphics because we

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.400
think that having better
character graphics

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.090
will make the game
more intuitive.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.800
So one of the ways you play
this game, if you haven't played

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.240
it before, is you have
a bunch of characters--

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.781
I'll show in a
second-- and you click

00:23:21.781 --> 00:23:24.080
on them based on different
characteristics to try

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.810
and offer them
water or tell them,

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.160
maybe you should go inside,
it's really how out today.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.845
And different people will
react differently to you.

00:23:31.845 --> 00:23:33.995
And right now you have
a bunch of characters--

00:23:33.995 --> 00:23:35.530
where's my mouse?

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.590
And I'm going to play this.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.220
They all look pretty
much the same.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.130
And we have labels--

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.010
Uh, you're already laughing.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:45.784
Did something--

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:46.950
AUDIENCE: There was a flare.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:47.783
STUDENT 5: Oh, yeah.

00:23:47.783 --> 00:23:50.345
So I'll talk about that
in a second as well.

00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:53.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.690
So we wanted to increase
emotional investment

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.280
in this game.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.770
So one thing I talked about
was an explicit end condition.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.020
The other thing is-- we
know that setting on fire

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.050
is extreme and, at this
point, kind of funny.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:06.070
We all just laughed.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.654
It's not meant to scare you, but
it is meant to make you care.

00:24:08.654 --> 00:24:10.320
Before, we just had
people disappearing.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.351
And, number one, people
didn't know that people

00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.600
had disappeared on the screen.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.100
Players were like,
what happened?

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.550
Suddenly there are less people.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.340
And then they'd get
to the newspaper scene

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.680
and they'd say seven
people have fainted.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.410
Nothing.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.760
So we added the fire just as
a somewhat comedic element,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.740
somewhat just emotionally
investment element.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.102
I don't want my people to
get set on fire, you know?

00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:31.560
So that has to do
with playability.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.580
And also the same thing with
the graphics and the fire,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.860
is education.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.910
We wanted to make this
stick with people long-term

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.490
and we thought
that maybe having,

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.030
like, a more surprising reaction
to them not doing anything

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.027
would make it stick with them.

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:48.610
Something else we're working on
[? with get ?] education is we

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.160
need better and more dialogue.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.680
So we redid the backend of
our system for dialogue,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.526
and it doesn't-- uh-oh.

00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:00.026
Sorry.

00:25:00.026 --> 00:25:01.480
I'm really bad at this.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.650
We redid the backend so that
it would support better choice

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.380
trees.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.300
We haven't actually
added the content yet,

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.216
which is something we're
working on right now,

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:11.120
but we have the
whole backend working

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.910
so that you can make decisions
that actually really do

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.437
effect what happens next.

00:25:15.437 --> 00:25:17.270
Something people
complained about throughout

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.030
is they felt like their decision
weren't having an impact.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.760
That's going to be a
lot more clear now.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.680
And then finally we're
implementing on setting up

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.660
longer-term choices.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.980
So right now you
can click on people

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.930
and you might talk to
them and they might not

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.880
accept the water, they
might accept the water.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.130
You might have a discussion
with them and make them drink.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.550
But we wanted to have
longer-term choices.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.190
So what if you wanted to set
up a public water fountain

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.150
or something like that?

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.415
And another thing that
we're talking about

00:25:48.415 --> 00:25:50.070
is setting up
umbrellas and it might

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.540
be worth more of
your time to just,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.410
you know-- the forecast
for the next day

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.130
it might say it's going to be
108, but today it's only 80,

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.240
so let's set up a
water fountain today

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.850
so that tomorrow all the people
can just get water and be

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.829
a little healthier.

00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:03.620
So that's the two things
we're focusing on,

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.440
playability and education.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.851
And we still have a lot of
work to do, which is obvious,

00:26:08.851 --> 00:26:10.850
but we've done a lot of
the backend work already

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.788
and we think it's
going pretty well.

00:26:13.788 --> 00:26:15.732
Any questions?

00:26:15.732 --> 00:26:17.676
PROFESSOR: Questions anyone?

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:18.648
STUDENT 5: Yes?

00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:19.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.390
STUDENT 5: Oh, Julia did this.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.569
Isn't it pretty?

00:26:21.569 --> 00:26:22.535
AUDIENCE: That's dope.

00:26:22.535 --> 00:26:23.018
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:26:23.018 --> 00:26:23.934
STUDENT 5: It is dope.

00:26:23.934 --> 00:26:24.467
I agree.

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:25.916
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:28.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.710
STUDENT 5: Any other questions?

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.470
PABLO: Thank you.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.400
Quick comments.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.280
I agree with the idea of making
something like the flame that

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.470
is visually compelling.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.160
You may want to think-- if
that's what you end up, fine.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.870
But beware that the idea
of fire is very much

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.520
elicits a hazard,
something external,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.510
whereas the nature
of the heat wave risk

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.745
is a combination of the
hazard like the fire

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:55.710
and the vulnerability
of the player.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.500
How susceptible
are you, which is

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.920
different from an
elderly asthmatic person

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.660
versus a healthy sports person.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.530
So if you can brainstorm
about how to depict that,

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.685
which can be more
evocative of the fact

00:27:07.685 --> 00:27:09.870
that it depends on
the person and not

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.930
just some external thing.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:11.210
STUDENT 5: OK.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.293
PABLO: I have no idea how.

00:27:12.293 --> 00:27:14.460
Maybe it's not doable,
but if you can,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.414
that would be
[? an invitation. ?]

00:27:17.414 --> 00:27:18.830
STUDENT 5: And
even if we can't do

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.330
that we're going
to try to implement

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.310
that same concept
through the dialogue

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.308
by making the dialogue very
specific, based on the person.

00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:26.016
PABLO: Excellent.

00:27:26.016 --> 00:27:26.480
Great.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.979
STUDENT 5: Yeah,
you had a question?

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.818
We found the fire funny.

00:27:30.818 --> 00:27:32.990
Do you think everybody
would find it funny?

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.120
STUDENT 5: So you have to
think about the audience

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.100
for this game.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.800
The audience for this game
is the Red Cross worker.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.276
Now I don't necessarily
think that all of them

00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:43.150
will think it's funny,
but they'll definitely

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.319
elicit some reaction, and I
think that's what's important.

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:47.860
Because before in
our game we weren't

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.560
eliciting any sort of reaction,
so it wasn't memorable.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.567
The fire might be funny to some,
it might be scary to others,

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:56.650
thinking about people going
on fire, I don't know.

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.070
Me, personally, I think
it's a little terrifying.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.270
But either way it
elicits a reaction.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.550
That's really what
we're going for.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.070
Any other questions?

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.210
PABLO: One minor comment.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:06.966
STUDENT 5: Yes?

00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:08.466
PABLO: Most of the
rest of the world

00:28:08.466 --> 00:28:10.599
uses degrees Celsius as
opposed to Farenheit--

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:11.182
STUDENT 5: Oh.

00:28:11.182 --> 00:28:13.599
PABLO: So consider having
a choice for [? that. ?]

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:15.140
STUDENT 5: That's
a great suggestion.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.030
Thank you.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.075
We'll take that
into consideration.

00:28:17.075 --> 00:28:17.866
You had a question?

00:28:17.866 --> 00:28:20.040
PROFESSOR: And
your biggest risk?

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.900
STUDENT 5: Our biggest
risk is-- so we're not

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.510
adding any features, but
from our product backlog

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.960
it's just we're redoing a lot.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.530
So just the sheer amount
and the breakdown of work--

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.258
it's just we're redoing a lot.

00:28:36.258 --> 00:28:37.719
PROFESSOR: And
that's content work,

00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:39.684
or is it front and
backend work still?

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:41.850
STUDENT 5: So we redid a
lot of the backend already,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.310
but in terms of the adding of
objects, that's more backend.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.320
But in terms of the dialogue
and stuff, that's more content.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.158
So we have work on both sides.

00:28:50.158 --> 00:28:51.592
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:51.592 --> 00:28:53.026
STUDENT 5: Thank you.

00:28:53.026 --> 00:28:53.982
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:55.894
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:55.894 --> 00:28:58.907
Next up is Saving
the Animal Village.

00:28:58.907 --> 00:28:59.490
STUDENT 6: OK.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.200
So I'm just going to start
talking while Justin sets up.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.370
We are a subset of Saving
the Animal Village.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:09.790
And our game is trying to
teach cholera prevention

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.370
through a series of
minigames, three.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:16.670
And then the story
is that the mayor

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.130
needs help deciding
whether or not

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.680
cholera is what is
plaguing the city

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.160
or if it's this monster that
you encounter in the beginning.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.950
And so the player will go
through, explore the town,

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.870
and try to convince the mayor
that it is, indeed, cholera.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:38.580
The most prevalent
things that we

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.000
need to fix, I guess-- the
prevalent problems that we need

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.490
to fix are-- when we playtested
with Pablo some time back

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.340
he noted that our minigames--
for example, the filtration

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.210
minigame-- wasn't
really something

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.090
that would connect to our
audience, which were children

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.940
who were in affected areas,
like Ghana, from the ages of 8

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.250
to 13.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.760
And we had this, like,
factory setting before

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.980
and it was not something a
child would encounter ever.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.520
So what we're changing it to is,
it's going to be inside a home

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.610
and a mother's going to be the
one that's bringing the water.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.890
And it's going to
be basically things

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.890
that children that will
be playing this game

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:28.650
can relate to.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.610
And we're still in the
progress of changing that.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:38.280
And we're also in the progress
of adding conversation UI

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.750
that's functional
and that we can

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:46.380
use while not alienating the
lower range of our age range.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.160
Because Pablo mentioned that the
children in Ghana [? who are ?]

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.970
8 years old might not be
able to read as well as

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.320
we want them to.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.390
So we're going to have
more visual instructions

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.290
as well, which is important.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.310
And that will probably
be the deciding factor of

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.320
whether or not this
game will be successful.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.530
I would say the
thing that is keeping

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:15.000
us back the most right now
is the art, which we have

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.190
to synthesize to
match Ghana culture

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.384
and communicate our
message as well.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.920
We're also attempting to
implement a way to integrate

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.480
the minigames more
through our main scene,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.852
but we'll see how much progress
we get through [? and ?]

00:31:34.852 --> 00:31:36.810
[? we'll have ?]
[? to correct ?] that feature.

00:31:40.205 --> 00:31:41.175
Any questions?

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.870
PABLO: Just one clarification.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.910
When I referred to
matching, I like

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.480
what you just showed way better
than what was there before.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.615
And I think if this
is the end aesthetic

00:31:54.615 --> 00:31:57.800
of that minigame, that's fine.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.810
My inclination is to
think not so much matching

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.330
to Ghana culture, but making
it more adequate or suitable.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:09.380
So if it looks like science
fiction to a Ghanaian child,

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.100
that's fine.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.370
There must be someone from
Ghana around the Boston area.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:20.070
Send an email, talk to
taxi drivers, I don't know.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.000
Just like you're doing
playtesting with kids,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.840
try to find someone from
West Africa, if not Ghana

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.850
so that they can
tell you, no, cats

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.189
are actually
spiritually poisonous

00:32:30.189 --> 00:32:31.230
or whatever they may say.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.930
I have no idea.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.462
But you want to get
some kind of feedback.

00:32:34.462 --> 00:32:35.380
I love cats.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.481
I hope they're not
spiritually poisonous.

00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:38.980
Good.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.580
And then there were
many, many games.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.500
We will converse later,
but this core idea I think

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.670
is a very useful one.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.910
I'll be keen to learn more about
how the game can be adjusted

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:55.872
in terms of speed of learning
and the speed of-- as you

00:32:55.872 --> 00:32:57.580
master it and it
becomes more complicated

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.930
because of things moving
faster or some kind

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.290
of additional complexity.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:01.940
But good.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.600
Well done.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.760
PROFESSOR: So biggest risk?

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.010
Are you going to say it's art?

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.690
You mentioned the art.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:07.980
STUDENT 6: Yeah.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.230
PROFESSOR: What about the art?

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.406
Is it the UI art or the
representational art

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:12.280
that we talked about?

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:12.946
STUDENT 6: Yeah.

00:33:12.946 --> 00:33:16.840
So it's mostly making sure
the representational art

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.310
aligns with-- what
we think of it

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.700
aligns with what our
intended players think of it.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.204
And also just, like, we
have so much art to produce.

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:27.120
Like, getting it done.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.890
PROFESSOR: The gameplay is
there, all the buttons work,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.600
it's just getting
stuff onto that?

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.016
STUDENT 6: Also the conversation
UI, but our biggest risk,

00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:34.900
I think, is the art.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.860
STUDENT 7: It's
mostly functional.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.767
There's a few bugs to iron out,
but the structure's all there.

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:39.701
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:33:39.701 --> 00:33:42.920
Last questions?

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.317
Thank you.

00:33:44.317 --> 00:33:50.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.520
All right.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.770
Any generalized feedback you
want to give the whole class?

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.380
PABLO: Yeah.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.330
You're now in a place where
you have on one hand more

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.040
to do than probably
you think you can,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.200
but also more temptation to
do more things, new things,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.860
explore new ways of
representing, et cetera.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.909
It will be a balancing act.

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:10.800
In order to get a
passing grade you

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.219
have to deliver something
that works well enough.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:14.780
I'll let them define that.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.830
I invite you to
remain inquisitive

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.190
as to those simple-to-implement
new ideas that can help

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.600
something be really better.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.300
So don't try to do
something really better that

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.679
require starting from scratch.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.540
That'll be suicidal
at this stage.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.829
But that balance is
a balance that you

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:37.120
will be experiencing throughout
the rest of your lives,

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.328
whether it's designing a
video game for the Red Cross

00:34:39.328 --> 00:34:42.408
or designing, you know, rockets.

00:34:42.408 --> 00:34:43.949
Good luck with it
all, and we'll have

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.489
more personalized conversations
after the half hour

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:48.190
presentation.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.400
Thank you.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:48.889
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.014
PABLO: And I'll be outside.

00:34:50.014 --> 00:34:51.190
You let me know when.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.874
PROFESSOR: We're done?

00:34:53.874 --> 00:34:56.040
Do you guys need to take
a-- should we take a break?

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.790
Should we just keep going?

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
10 minute [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.828
So we're going to take
a quick 10-minute break.

00:35:01.828 --> 00:35:03.190
It's 1:50 right now.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.360
So 2 o'clock.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.680
If you want to talk about and
synthesize the feedback we just

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.260
gave you, do that right now.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.170
On the presentations
you just gave.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.510
You did really well.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.140
You knew the problems that
you had, which is good,

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.319
because I was worried on
playtest that you might not

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:24.860
know some of the issues that
you were seeing in the playtest.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.485
So that's good.

00:35:25.485 --> 00:35:27.340
We're really glad to see that.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.740
The big challenge I
see for your future

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.990
is planning for fixing those--
responding to those problems

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.949
that you know.

00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:37.740
There's just a lot of
unforeseen stuff that

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.000
can happen between now
and the end of class,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.060
and that is what my talk
is going to be about,

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.950
is how to plan for disaster.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.910
And part of that is, just
don't have the disaster.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.980
Cut it from the get go.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.930
So let me just make
sure this is up.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.410
Next.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.910
All right.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.060
You have deadlines.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.840
This is the creative process.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.790
Deadlines happen at
the end of the process.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.740
Hopefully work happens
before the process.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:12.330
In this class your deadline is
the last day of class, right?

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.535
Double check your Stellar,
you might be surprised.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.955
In the real world
some of your deadlines

00:36:19.955 --> 00:36:21.160
are going to be demo days.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:21.750
E3.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.880
Anybody heard the term E3 demo?

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.616
And soul-crushing-E3
demo, and studio

00:36:26.616 --> 00:36:30.440
closed after failure of E3 demo?

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.600
Basically, show your game
off to a bunch of press

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.870
and hope it works.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.077
Usually that means don't
allow any press to play it.

00:36:40.077 --> 00:36:41.160
You just play it for them.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.100
And by playing it for them,
that might be just showing them

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.170
the video while you
manipulate the controller.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.150
You don't get to do
that in this class.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.024
Other terms you might
hear from the industry.

00:36:49.024 --> 00:36:50.420
Going gold.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.770
It's not just for disco.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.300
It is-- the Gold Master
there on the left side,

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.060
that's a game that went gold
and actually was canceled.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.255
It got all the way
to Gold Master,

00:37:00.255 --> 00:37:02.380
and then they said, no,
we're not going to ship it.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.630
We're not going to produce it.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.950
It's just not good enough.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.970
That can happen.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:06.670
Ship dates.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.990
Back in the day games
came in these things

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.240
called boxes made out of
cardboard with printed

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.899
graphics that were in
interesting-- Eidos

00:37:13.899 --> 00:37:15.690
would make them in
these trapezoidal things

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.880
so they wouldn't quite
fit on the shelf.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.560
So you would see--
that's an Eidos product.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.290
Thief-- were you on this
one, Thief, The Dark Project?

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:24.180
SARA VERILLI: Yep.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.080
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.380
Tomb Raider as well.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.260
Again, you don't exactly
have a boxed ship date,

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.010
but you have a give us a
playable version of the game

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.920
ship date.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.840
So how much time
do you have left?

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.900
December 10.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.660
You have 17 days
left between now

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.850
and then to finish your game.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.070
Well, let's assume you
don't work on Thanksgiving.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.254
Anybody going home to
see family or anything?

00:37:48.254 --> 00:37:49.170
A good portion of you.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.447
Are you going to work while
you're with your family?

00:37:52.447 --> 00:37:53.530
Maybe you're going to try.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:59.239
Maybe you're in a turkey coma,
or veggie turkey coma for me.

00:37:59.239 --> 00:38:00.780
But what about the
presentation week?

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.930
So December 8 and
10, you're actually

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:05.040
in class working on
your presentations.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.160
Hopefully your game works by the
start of class on December 8.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.179
Hopefully.

00:38:10.179 --> 00:38:12.220
We're actually going to
recommend that you do not

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.340
change your game on
December 8 and December 10,

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.770
and you do a thing
we call "soak,"

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.110
which I'll talk about later.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.540
It's totally up to you to do it.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.990
I offer it every year.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.550
It's almost never taken.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.720
But I'm offering it.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.580
So actually, was that 13 days
or was it really 30 hours?

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.156
You've got 12-- this is
a 12-hour-a-week course.

00:38:31.156 --> 00:38:33.780
I took out the time that you're
actually spent here in lecture,

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.904
that I'm stealing from you.

00:38:34.904 --> 00:38:35.440
Sorry.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.330
I like talking sometimes.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.190
So you really have
less than 1 work week

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.314
to get all this stuff done.

00:38:40.314 --> 00:38:43.150
So think about that when you're
thinking about your projects.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.080
Can you do all this in
one regular professional,

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.000
less than 40 hour work week?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.101
So that's scary.

00:38:53.101 --> 00:38:54.350
How do you meet your deadline?

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.830
Do you crunch or do you cut?

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.945
Who's heard the
word crunch before?

00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:01.130
Just raise your hand
it you've heard it.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.826
All right.

00:39:01.826 --> 00:39:04.450
Raise your hand if you do crunch
right now, if you are actually

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.408
in the middle of crunch,
not even on this class

00:39:06.408 --> 00:39:08.140
but in other classes.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:08.857
Yeah.

00:39:08.857 --> 00:39:10.690
As students, you already
know how to crunch.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.620
You do this.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.370
This is your daily life.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.160
And it's expected in some
cases, it's some problems

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.610
with the system, guess what?

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.040
The same problems in
the game industry.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.030
There is a way to do crunch--
to do a viable crunch.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.380
And that's actually what
next week is probably

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.710
going to be for you,
is your crunch week.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.930
So ways you can do
crunch and ways crunch

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:37.000
is viable in the actual,
real world industry.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.940
You spend a limited
time period in crunch.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.487
So if you hear
about death marches,

00:39:42.487 --> 00:39:43.570
that's not a limited time.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.820
That can be months,
years spent working

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:52.760
80-hour days on some studios,
unnamed, in Australia.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.660
We're recommending
spending one sprint.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.452
If you do a planned
sprint we say, in advance,

00:39:58.452 --> 00:40:00.160
that we are going to
crunch on this week.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.181
That means we're going to spend
that week picking up the slack

00:40:03.181 --> 00:40:04.680
and getting through
a bunch of stuff

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.210
and we're going to work
a long period of time.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.030
And it's going to be awesome.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.821
Because guess what?

00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:08.800
It's voluntary.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.010
It is team-driven.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.270
We decided, as a
team, to do this.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.600
The management did not say, you
are going to crunch right now.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.582
And in fact, a lot of
game industry would say,

00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:18.540
that's not even crunch.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.720
You're having too much fun.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.980
That can't be crunch.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:25.500
For them crunch is
compulsory, unpaid over-time.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.324
Three words that I despise.

00:40:29.324 --> 00:40:31.365
So if you are going to
crunch and it is voluntary

00:40:31.365 --> 00:40:32.915
and you plan for
it in advance, you

00:40:32.915 --> 00:40:35.660
would follow it by deep soak.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:40.310
Deep soak, in this case, means
test, play, itemize bugs.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.640
It means you are
playing your game,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.820
you are understanding every
subtle nuance of the user

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.600
experience of your game.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.490
You probably have a very good
understanding of the programmer

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.707
experience of your game, of
the artist, of the producer,

00:40:53.707 --> 00:40:54.790
of the person on the team.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.425
You know how your game ticks
from your point of view.

00:40:57.425 --> 00:40:59.800
But you don't yet know it from
the players point of view,

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.690
even after focus testing,
even after seeing

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:02.789
other players play it.

00:41:02.789 --> 00:41:04.330
You probably haven't
played your game

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.163
enough to really
understand what's going on.

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:08.170
What it actually
does from the get go.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.850
So you play it a lot,
you itemize bugs,

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.850
you prioritize bugs,
you write bugs down,

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.800
but you don't actually fix them.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.380
You just see what they
are, see how bad they are,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.051
decide whether or not afterwards
you want to fix them or not.

00:41:21.051 --> 00:41:21.550
All right.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.770
So that's how you do crunch.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:24.570
I give that to you.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.920
You will probably do it.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.130
That is OK.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.420
Good luck.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.720
But, advanced course.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.610
If you want to cut features,
this is how you cut features.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.260
So from now until
December 8, ask yourself,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.939
can you ship your
game right now?

00:41:37.939 --> 00:41:39.730
That's part of the
aspect of sprint, right?

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.350
At the end of a
sprint you should

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.560
be able to ship your game.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.540
It's a viable product.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.040
I can send it over the
wall, someone can play it,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.020
and it is good and ready to go.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.090
In order to do that--
and in this talk

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.232
I'm assuming that,
in order to do this,

00:41:53.232 --> 00:41:55.440
you're going to need to
reduce the scope of your game

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.690
because you need
to ship it soon.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.900
So what can you cut?

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.260
Some developers say these are
the only things you should cut.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.290
Features that are not
fun and features that

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.900
do not advance the game's goals.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.360
So play the game a lot.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.410
Decide whether or not
those features are fun,

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.120
collect evidence for it, have
a theory about what is fun

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.360
or what is not fun,
identify those features

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.320
that go towards that
theory and remove them.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.359
Just don't even continue
working on them.

00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:25.150
In this case you're
thinking about the game

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:27.275
from the idea of your player
and your stakeholders.

00:42:29.135 --> 00:42:31.510
These are basically features
that if you spent more time,

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.090
it would not be time well-spent.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.390
But there's some other ones.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.848
There are features that are
too big to be finished in time.

00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:41.290
Really take a realistic look at
your product backlog right now

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:44.260
and decide if you can
finish it in time or not.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.330
Could you cut those features?

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.760
Just give it a moment's thought.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.030
Think about it.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.020
Features that just don't work.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.500
Why bother fixing something
if it's just going

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.115
to stay broken in two weeks?

00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:56.740
Can you cut it?

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.698
Can you just remove it?

00:42:57.698 --> 00:42:59.320
Does it change the game or not?

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.980
Can you even fix
these in time anyway?

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.438
You just have to
look at it and you

00:43:02.438 --> 00:43:05.600
have to analyze it and decide.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.830
So how would you actually
go ahead and do that?

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.780
Hopefully you can say
yes to these things.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.800
Is your product backlog
currently prioritized

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.810
right now?

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.390
Did you estimate
your features well?

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.223
So did you estimate the
size and the time it

00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:23.020
takes to create the features?

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.410
And did you create good blocks
of work in your sprints?

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.820
And my guess is, probably not.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.900
And that's OK.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.140
We talked to you about Scrum,
we talked to you about Agile.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.050
The thing is, Scrum
is not a process.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.820
Scrum is people doing a process.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.890
You could be the best
person, the best programmer

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.380
in the world and
be put onto a team,

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.890
and still have all the problems
that you're having right

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.580
now because the team doesn't
know each other that well.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.980
That's one of the things we
try to do on the first couple

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.634
projects, is get
you used to working

00:43:53.634 --> 00:43:55.050
with the other
people in the class

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.133
so you can find people
that you've compatible work

00:43:57.133 --> 00:43:57.810
styles with.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.570
So that when you're
in project four

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.930
you have a chance at
forming a good, solid team

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:04.180
and having some team dynamics.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.096
And remember when I
talked about team dynamics

00:44:06.096 --> 00:44:08.040
earlier in the semester?

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.710
Would anybody say that they
are in the performing mode?

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.094
Like, do you feel like
you are performing well?

00:44:15.094 --> 00:44:16.260
Do you have an engine going?

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.670
Do you see tasks get done?

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.651
Do they just fall off the list
because, oh, that was done.

00:44:21.651 --> 00:44:22.400
That was verified.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.290
That was awesome.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.365
Has that happened yet?

00:44:27.179 --> 00:44:27.720
Probably not.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.940
That's OK.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.440
Yeah.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.356
A lot of head-shaking.

00:44:30.356 --> 00:44:30.940
That's OK.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.950
So we need something
else we can try out,

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:36.632
because that's
not going to work.

00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:38.090
And even in the
ideal world, you're

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:39.215
still going to have to cut.

00:44:39.215 --> 00:44:42.591
Like, developers cut
features every day.

00:44:42.591 --> 00:44:44.340
Those are the tools
they have to use them,

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.790
but when those fail
we have other tools.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.730
So based on what I read
from your project three,

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.260
some people think
cutting features

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.220
means dropping features.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.140
That's slightly different.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.472
It's not exactly the same.

00:44:57.472 --> 00:44:59.930
The difference between a cut
feature and a dropped feature?

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.100
A cut feature has intention.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.017
You've planned for it.

00:45:03.017 --> 00:45:05.183
You're going to tie up loose
ends around the feature

00:45:05.183 --> 00:45:07.150
after you've removed it
from the feature list.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.890
You'll actually even delete
the feature from your product

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:13.080
backlog, and feel
really good about it,

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.820
and not have to ever worry about
it again because it's gone.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:16.880
It's no longer going
to be in there.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.110
Dropped features
are those things

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:19.125
at the bottom of
the backlog that

00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:20.750
just don't get into
the game at the end

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.900
and could cause major
issues if they're

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.380
connected to other systems.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.390
So how do you have
that intention?

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:30.930
You think through
the dependencies.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:35.830
Scrum does not have a good tool
for identifying dependencies.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.320
It's actually one of
its weakest points.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.400
It assumes that, if you
do all the other stuff

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.870
your dependencies will just
fall into place because you've

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.640
created really
good backlog items

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.319
and you've organized them well.

00:45:47.319 --> 00:45:48.860
So this is one of
those things where,

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.050
if you had a couple
more weeks maybe

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.675
you would want to
switch to waterfall

00:45:52.675 --> 00:45:55.790
or go into a Gantt
chart or figure out

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.675
a way to graph every
little thing that's

00:45:58.675 --> 00:45:59.550
going on in the game.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.680
And I'm going to
say, don't do that.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.826
But think about that
and get in that mindset.

00:46:04.826 --> 00:46:07.200
So take a look at your code
and backlog for dependencies.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.020
And here's one really easy
thought experiment to take.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.390
look at your biggest
unfinished feature

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.010
and just think what would
happen if you just didn't do it.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:23.159
So in one of the games
I saw-- this team here.

00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:23.950
One of these teams.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:24.950
You two teams over here.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.980
What's your biggest
unfinished feature right now?

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:28.500
Either team.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.120
Somebody just say it out loud.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.090
Maybe Matt, while he's chewing.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.148
Or somebody else.

00:46:35.148 --> 00:46:38.070
AUDIENCE: Our time to gather
all the clues in our endgame.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:39.540
PROFESSOR: Time to gather
all the clues in the endgame.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.670
That's your biggest
unfinished one?

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.691
What would happen if
you just didn't do that?

00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:45.400
AUDIENCE: There would be
no purpose to the game.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.440
So is it still the same game?

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.790
Not really.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.540
Would the other features
feel its absence?

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.480
Hells yes.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:53.980
All right.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.345
So trace your dependencies,
take a look at that thing,

00:46:58.345 --> 00:47:00.720
go down the line and see, what
all the other systems that

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.090
are tied into it?

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.085
This is where graphing
could be helpful.

00:47:04.085 --> 00:47:05.990
A little mind map, node map.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.540
If I wasn't crunching and
actually made this presentation

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.120
this morning, I would
have had that graph.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.340
But can you identify
the loose ends?

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.840
And then if you've cut those
loose ends off of that feature,

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.107
is your primary feature usable,
understandable, and polished?

00:47:20.107 --> 00:47:22.190
You don't have to do this
for every single feature

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.810
on your feature list, but
identify one or two really

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.810
big ones and just do a
little thought experiment

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.450
and see what would
happen if they went away.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.116
Because they're going
to go away at some

00:47:30.116 --> 00:47:31.970
point in the next
week and a half.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.027
So you've identified a feature
and you're going to say,

00:47:36.027 --> 00:47:37.360
we're going to cut this feature.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.443
We're not going to drop
it, we're going to cut it.

00:47:39.443 --> 00:47:42.260
What exactly does that mean?

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.630
So think cut plus.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:47.720
So cut the feature, replace
it with a different, smaller

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.440
feature.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.040
Key word there is smaller.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.051
Based on new knowledge
you know your game

00:47:52.051 --> 00:47:53.800
better now than you
knew it when you first

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.760
made that product backlog.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.230
That fits a similar purpose.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.464
This is an OK solution.

00:47:59.464 --> 00:48:01.380
It takes a little bit
of time and you actually

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.010
might be too late to
do that right now.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.830
An example could be, you've got
a first person shooting game

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.530
and you have rocket
launchers, but you

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.240
don't have animated missiles.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.900
Cut the rocket launcher.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.460
You have-- what
else do you have?

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.460
You need another weapon.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.626
You need another big weapon.

00:48:18.626 --> 00:48:19.800
Maybe you have a ray gun.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.434
Maybe you can already
animate things

00:48:21.434 --> 00:48:22.600
on top of another character.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.070
So you have a ray gun that
if you press the button,

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.510
anybody in front of the button
has a little animation that

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.970
vaporizes and dies.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.200
You've got a very
similar feature going on.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.410
It's a cool weapon.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.824
It's damage heavy.

00:48:34.824 --> 00:48:36.240
You don't need to
do that animated

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.650
bullet, that animated
missile, and you save yourself

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:39.670
some time.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.705
And you haven't hurt the game.

00:48:41.705 --> 00:48:44.080
The player doesn't even know
that that wasn't even there.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.770
You didn't give the
player a rocket launcher

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:48.103
that didn't fire missiles,
and just made people randomly

00:48:48.103 --> 00:48:48.770
blow up.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:52.390
You've given them something
different and new and exciting.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.540
Next one, cut and redesign.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.650
So take the same feature
and then shrink it.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.890
Redesign it for a smaller scope.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.010
Again, based on new knowledge.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.660
I'm playing the new
Pokemon right now.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.280
Pokemon, that really
outrageous, complex, matrix

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.340
of strength and weaknesses.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.890
When you break it down
it's rock, paper, scissors.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.670
I'm trying to make a game and
I want to out-Pokemon Pokemon.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:18.810
I'm going to have
modifiers for everything,

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:24.490
I'm going to have even longer
lists of different enemy types.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:26.280
Maybe I just need
to go back to rock,

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.530
paper, scissors, do
a thought experiment,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.960
create a short little prototype.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.020
That's one thing
you can do right now

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.350
is you can create paper
prototypes on your own.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.164
You've got big enough teams that
one person can say, let me do

00:49:36.164 --> 00:49:38.080
a really quick paper
prototype of that feature

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.450
to see what it would look like.

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.680
Let me look at all the
previous features we have,

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.170
make sure it matches, and
come up with a little paper

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.670
version of it and
see, is that going

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.980
to fit the same thing or not?

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.140
And if it does, great.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.149
You've saved yourself
a ton of time.

00:49:50.149 --> 00:49:52.690
[? Today in ?] content, as we
saw in the presentations today.

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.570
Content is ginormous.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:57.530
Churning through
that is really hard.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.720
Lastly, cut and amplify.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.920
Take an already developed
feature and make it better.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.950
So did you promise 32
guns for your shooter?

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.390
Could 20 just be enough?

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.840
And then spend that time
you have with those 20 guns

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.580
to make them better
and more polished.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.221
So I already went back to guns.

00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:16.720
That's just where
my head was today.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.160
If you think, if
you had one good,

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:27.390
really, awesome weapon-- double
sawed-off shotgun in Quake,

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.210
maybe.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.170
That was pretty cool.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:30.700
I used that one a lot.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.025
And then a bunch of poorly
developed ones-- BFG.

00:50:33.025 --> 00:50:35.490
I don't even understand why
they even put that in there.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.380
Was that in Quake or
was it just in Doom?

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:37.660
AUDIENCE: Doom.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.540
PROFESSOR: But
either way, though.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.700
You rarely saw it.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.240
It was cool for one second.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.990
Maybe if that was a hugely
important, expensive thing,

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:46.040
maybe cut it and the player
doesn't even feel it.

00:50:48.281 --> 00:50:49.780
So in all three of
these things when

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.905
we're cutting the feature
what we're thinking about

00:50:51.905 --> 00:50:53.840
is, what does the player see?

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.790
Does the player
have-- what did I say?

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.530
Expected feedback.

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.119
If you drop a feature
might the player

00:51:00.119 --> 00:51:01.910
still expect some
feedback that they're not

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:04.330
getting because that
feature's no longer there?

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:05.917
If you cut it the
player should never

00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:07.000
know that it wasn't there.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:11.770
Here's a game where
they dropped features.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:18.600
This is one of our favorite
examples from 2003, Big Rigs.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.670
Where's my mouse?

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.535
Anybody played it?

00:51:22.535 --> 00:51:22.790
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:23.480
-Hey, kids.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.610
Strap yourself in for
some action-packed racing.

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:28.420
It's Big Rigs.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.100
18 wheels of thunder,
and we got trucks.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.070
Yeah, trucks.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.820
Big Rigs.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.500
Off-road traction.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.670
More power for non-stop
driving action.

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.820
Big Rigs.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:43.570
PROFESSOR: It's Big
Rigs off-road driving.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.440
You can drive off the road.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.760
-Who knows?

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.370
Big Rigs.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:49.750
Never lose a race again.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.076
You're always winner
with Big Rigs.

00:51:52.076 --> 00:51:54.450
PROFESSOR: You always win,
every time you get through it.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.252
There's no timer.

00:51:55.252 --> 00:51:57.460
-Phasing molecular mechanics
to pass through solids--

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:57.930
PROFESSOR: Whoa!

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.096
- --so as not to interrupt--

00:51:59.096 --> 00:52:00.860
PROFESSOR: Is this the future?

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.300
-Nothing stands in your
way when you're Big Rigs.

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.285
Rear-spinning tires
with warp-drive velocity

00:52:07.285 --> 00:52:08.969
for inter-dimensional exploring.

00:52:08.969 --> 00:52:11.510
Leave the game behind and exceed
the boundaries of existence!

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.520
PROFESSOR: This game shipped.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.580
This game was put on a
disk, was put in a box,

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.660
was delivered to your local
game store and Walmart.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.750
People bought it, I think.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.893
-Big mother-fuckin' Rigs!

00:52:24.893 --> 00:52:26.342
-Big Rigs.

00:52:26.342 --> 00:52:27.310
[END PLAYBACK]

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.476
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that was
advertised as the trailer.

00:52:29.476 --> 00:52:32.330
I quickly found out it
wasn't, but I kept it anyway.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:33.260
Humor.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.581
Oh, where's my mouse?

00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:35.080
No!

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:44.710
[INAUDIBLE] speaker notes.

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:46.560
[INAUDIBLE] back.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.331
Apologies.

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:48.830
There.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.110
[INAUDIBLE] here, down there.

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:53.610
All right.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:53:00.060
So that is the ultimate
expression of dropped features.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:06.670
And-- oh, and I
forgot to copy this.

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:07.170
All right.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:11.430
So another example
of cut features.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:12.346
This is The Sims 4.

00:53:12.346 --> 00:53:14.470
This is a quote from the
executive producer, Rachel

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.600
Franklin.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:20.297
Basically what happened was,
when the game shipped-- well,

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:21.880
right before the
game shipped, players

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.580
identified that
through whatever they

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.747
did-- I think through
watching community forums,

00:53:26.747 --> 00:53:29.330
listening to what the developers
were talking about the game--

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:33.960
they identified 89 features
missing from The Sims 4.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.620
89 features that were not
in Sims 4 when it shipped.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.147
How did they know
about those features?

00:53:40.147 --> 00:53:41.980
Well, they were in Sims
1, 2, and 3 but they

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.020
didn't put them in 4, so
they should be in 4, right?

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.820
Basically, she says "I want
to put everything we've ever

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.860
created in the last 14
years into a base game,

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.314
but we simply can't.

00:53:51.314 --> 00:53:53.730
What we have done instead is
to create an incredibly rich,

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.007
robust experience.

00:53:55.007 --> 00:53:56.590
If we didn't build
the core foundation

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.430
but I gave you pools, that
wouldn't be the right thing

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.570
to do."

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.960
They didn't quite meet
the player experience.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.350
There could've been some
things that-- maybe there

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.800
were some problems
going on the production,

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.800
but they decided that they
still needed a core game that

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.740
could work because they
could always add some

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.977
of those features in later.

00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:13.810
There are some people
on the forums who say,

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.393
no, that's actually not going
to be working in the game engine

00:54:16.393 --> 00:54:18.835
because I'm the nerd on the
internet knows everything

00:54:18.835 --> 00:54:20.460
and I know you can't
do that, developer

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.640
who actually made the game.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.410
So that is a problem that they
knew they were going to have.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.010
They know that they have
it when they ship the game.

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:28.690
They have to come up
with a community response

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:29.550
to figure that out.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.220
And actually, that's something
we'll talk about next week when

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.810
it comes to
community management,

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.018
is when you're creating this
game and people find out

00:54:35.018 --> 00:54:37.659
about this game, how do
you then talk them down?

00:54:37.659 --> 00:54:39.200
But actually, in
the most part you'll

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.041
be talking about
bringing them up.

00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:42.540
All right.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.362
So we're going to
cut some features.

00:54:44.362 --> 00:54:45.570
We're not going to drop them.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:49.752
So who decides which
features are going to cut?

00:54:49.752 --> 00:54:51.210
Who decides what
and when, and then

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.376
who's going to implement it?

00:54:52.376 --> 00:54:54.680
How are we going to do this?

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.830
So the people who decide
which features get cut usually

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:59.167
are the stakeholders.

00:54:59.167 --> 00:55:00.750
In the professional
world that's going

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.750
to be that executive producer.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:05.200
For you that could
be your client.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.780
That could be your
product owner,

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.640
if you have a product
owner on your team,

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.930
if you have someone you consider
a vision owner on your team,

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:12.950
it could be that person.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:15.930
It could default down to
producer or Scrum Master,

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.550
if that's the
person we're saying

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.450
that we're following
their lead, they're

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.480
going to make that decision.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.277
It could be your game designer.

00:55:23.277 --> 00:55:25.110
But it's going to be
somebody on your teams.

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.568
One, maybe two
people on your teams

00:55:26.568 --> 00:55:30.339
who are coming up at least
with the what and the when.

00:55:30.339 --> 00:55:32.630
Not everybody on the team
knows the schedule as well as

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.420
maybe the producer does.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.510
But the who implements and
how it's implemented-- that's

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:38.700
the entire team's job.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.087
This is why we have those
long, boring Scrum meetings

00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:42.920
at the beginning and
the end of each sprint.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.586
It's because that's
the time period when

00:55:44.586 --> 00:55:48.000
we have all the team together to
make these kinds of decisions.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.420
It's definitely not the
producer and Scrum Masters' role

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.317
to decide how you're
going to cut that feature.

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.150
They're there to
facilitate it and make sure

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:59.710
that everybody who's attached to
that feature can talk about it,

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.550
can explain why, can
give some argument,

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.466
can give some defense.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.980
Rather than giving the
entire team the need

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.640
to decide everything,
one or two people

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.100
decide the initial part
and then the whole team

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.180
focuses on just how we're
going to cut those things.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.070
And that's because
how you implement

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.250
it requires knowledge of
both code and content.

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:24.960
It's more than a feature list.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.720
A feature list can't
do this for you.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.320
It can do the top, it can show
you the what, but never the

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.690
how.

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:32.190
All right.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:33.810
Last little section.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.860
So you were working on a feature
and your feature was cut.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.242
You spent a lot of
time on that feature.

00:56:40.242 --> 00:56:41.825
Your roll was to
implement networking.

00:56:41.825 --> 00:56:44.560
And this is actually an
example from two years ago.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.180
But was cut.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.770
In that case, it wasn't cut
because of these things.

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:50.860
I don't want to cut it.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.026
I want to see this finished.

00:56:52.026 --> 00:56:54.080
I put some commitment
into this thing, dammit.

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.650
I want to see this
all the way through.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.140
I feel guilty about cutting it.

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.450
I really let my team down.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:05.010
I was just working on
networking the entire semester,

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.890
and it's not going to
make it into the game.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.034
What have I been doing?

00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:10.200
I feel sad about cutting it.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:10.790
It's not fair.

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.300
How dare you cut my feature?

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.240
You're going to see a lot of
that, if you haven't already.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.449
But that's OK.

00:57:17.449 --> 00:57:18.990
One thing to keep
in mind when you're

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.698
cutting a feature--
and this is one thing

00:57:20.698 --> 00:57:23.330
that we told that person--
was, your work needed

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:28.700
to happen because otherwise you
wouldn't know that we needed

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.060
to know about your work.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.880
You described this
better, by the way.

00:57:33.745 --> 00:57:36.120
SARA VERILLI: I'm trying to
remember exactly what I said,

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.730
but it's something
to the effect of,

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.150
sometimes the work that
doesn't make it into the game

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:43.190
had to happen anyway
because you had

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:45.060
to do the work to
explore networking

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.110
to find out if it
wouldn't work or not.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.190
Just like you had to
do the work to explore

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.890
several other features
that did go into the game.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.044
But you didn't know
that the-- I don't

00:57:55.044 --> 00:57:56.960
know-- you didn't know
which of those features

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.797
were going to work out well.

00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:00.630
But you were hoping
that some of them would.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:02.870
Some of them did,
some of them didn't.

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:05.355
The fact that one
particular feature-- the one

00:58:05.355 --> 00:58:08.510
that you worked on-- is
not a reflection on you.

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:09.410
Not at all.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:11.780
It's a reflection on the
game, and the project

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.830
needs to go forward.

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:13.880
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.050
So yeah.

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.691
Work that gets cut
is never wasted work.

00:58:17.691 --> 00:58:19.190
And that's actually
a problem I have

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:21.480
when game developers
do their postmortems

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.274
and post in the Gamasutra is
they always talk about it as

00:58:24.274 --> 00:58:25.190
if it was wasted work.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:27.606
But really, again, they wouldn't
have had that information

00:58:27.606 --> 00:58:28.990
had they tried it.

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:31.370
Work well-cut is
exploratory work.

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:34.470
It means that you cut it early
enough that it was exploratory.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.225
You got your feelers around it.

00:58:36.225 --> 00:58:37.600
You figured out
that was probably

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.141
a direction you didn't want to
go into, and you pulled back.

00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:41.890
And actually you did
that in the beginning

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.460
with your paper prototypes.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.220
I don't think your
games now actually are

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.410
one-to-one relationships
to those paper prototypes

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.760
you created at the
beginning of this project.

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.270
And you threw those
away, and it was OK.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.570
So why is this important?

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:59.000
Because the team is more
important than the product,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
which is, unfortunately,
more important than you.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.520
But that's OK, because
the team equals you

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.970
plus others in the
same situation.

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:08.386
You are actually
part of the team.

00:59:08.386 --> 00:59:09.830
So just keep that in mind.

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:13.130
This is where I go to my
Goodfellas-- was it Goodfellas?

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:17.230
There's no I in
team, baseball bat?

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:18.271
You are on a team.

00:59:18.271 --> 00:59:19.520
Everyone's contributing to it.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.687
Everyone's doing
good work for it.

00:59:21.687 --> 00:59:23.770
All right. so that's my
spiel on cutting features.

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.860
Here is my-- what I'd
like to do on Wednesday.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.730
So Wednesday is going
to be a short class.

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:31.511
We're just meeting
from 1:00 to 2:00.

00:59:31.511 --> 00:59:34.010
You'll have the remainder of
the time to work in your group,

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.510
in your teams you as you like,
but if you want to take off,

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:39.294
you can take off.

00:59:39.294 --> 00:59:40.710
What we are going
to do-- and it's

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.960
going to be me, Phillip, and
Drew, because unfortunately

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.260
Sara won't be here--
is we're going

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.510
to meet with each of your teams
individually for about five,

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.470
seven minutes tops.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:55.680
What we'd like to do is look
at an updated vision statement.

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.200
So between now and then take
a look at the vision statement

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.480
you turned into
Stellar, compare it

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.080
to the game you have
right now, and modify it.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.424
The vision statement is your
publisher contract with us.

01:00:06.424 --> 01:00:08.590
That vision statement that
you actually finally turn

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.170
in on December 10
with your game,

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.370
is the thing that we are
judging your game by.

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.930
If your game has
all the features

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.867
that are described in that
vision statement, then aces.

01:00:18.867 --> 01:00:20.450
If you created a
vision statement that

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.120
doesn't have the
features are in the game,

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.130
or if you don't describe the
features well in the vision

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.970
statement then we're
going to use that

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.160
as an understanding of
what could have gone wrong

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.082
with that game.

01:00:30.082 --> 01:00:32.040
This should be a really
quick thing you can do.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.990
You can probably do this in five
minutes today with your team.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.920
You have everybody
here right now.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.020
You just had your presentations
about your products.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.340
So if you can take five minutes
today, reassess your vision

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.939
statement, take a look at your
product backlog, change it.

01:00:45.939 --> 01:00:47.230
We're going to talk about that.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.646
You can re-turn
that in to Stellar

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:51.982
or you can bring in a
paper version on Wednesday,

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.440
so long as we can
see it when we're

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.150
sitting with you on Wednesday.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.670
That's all we ask.

01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.290
And again, like I
said earlier, plan

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.760
as if nothing is being done
over Thanksgiving, just in case.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.380
If work happens over
Thanksgiving, cool.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.350
You did good.

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.980
That's bonus work.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.646
So just keep that in mind.

01:01:12.646 --> 01:01:15.780
Any questions?

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.410
All right.

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:18.710
Pablo is back in the room.

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:22.050
And you're working on your
teams for the rest of the day.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.656
Thank you.

01:01:23.656 --> 01:01:28.850

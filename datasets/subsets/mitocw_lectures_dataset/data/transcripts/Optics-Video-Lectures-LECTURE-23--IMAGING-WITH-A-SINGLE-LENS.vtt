00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.830
GUEST SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.480
Today we're going to
start with a demo,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.120
and we're going to
show experimentally

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.710
some of the principles
we've learned

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.439
about 4F systems in
the past classes,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.820
and actually we're going to see
a comparison of an incoherent

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.670
versus a coherent 4F system
when imaging resolution target.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.470
So but since now we have
all the tools to understand,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.900
finally, the set up here,
let me just describe it.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.650
I've been showing some
of these components

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.680
over and over the
past demos, but I

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.020
guess now we can
understand it, so

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.930
let me try to focus the camera.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.600
So let me start with
this is a green laser.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.550
So the first component
that we have here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.910
is [? anti ?] filter
that its job--

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.910
thank you-- so this
component, its job

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.130
is to control the
intensity of light

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.650
so we can attenuate it in
this case for experiment.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.410
This is an interesting component
called a spatial filter

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.130
that is composed of a microscope
objective and a pinhole,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
and now that we know what
Fourier transforms are,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.890
the microscope
objective is essentially

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.710
taking the Fourier transform
of the laser beam, which

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.830
ideally is a plane wave, so
it should be a delta function.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.095
However, since this plane
wave is not perfect,

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:42.420
it has high frequency noise.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.070
So then the pinhole,
what it does

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.380
is it does a low-pass
spatial filtering.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.680
So it basically removes all
these high frequency signal,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.720
and after these we have a nice
spherical wave coming out.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.380
This component here
is an iris, control

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.510
the diameter of
this spherical wave,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.720
and this element here
is my collimating lens

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.720
that will transform this
spherical wave into a plane

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.500
wave.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.030
In this case, this is
just a beam splitter

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.930
that will allow me to
couple from this side, where

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.060
I have a white light source.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.000
In this white light source,
we have a green filter,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.870
so then we only have
green light coming out.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.850
We have an iris again
to control the diameter.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.190
Right now I'm blocking
it, so it is a beam block.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.960
And these are collimating lens.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.480
So here it should be
the planar equivalent

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.650
of the incoherent side.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.350
This is the planar equivalent
of the coherent side.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.930
This mirror here bends the
light 90 degrees to send it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.330
to the side from here.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.340
This is the one line
of the incoherent line,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.680
and then should go
into the common path

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.500
of the coherent line.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.080
Then they basically
bend again 90 degrees,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.660
and this is the
4F system section.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.710
So here we have first an
element, which is the object

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.390
that we want to image.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.640
The object is called
the resolution target,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.150
and it's a clear substrate,
so a piece of glass

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.510
that has patterned chrome lines
of smaller and smaller sizes

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.090
that we're going to see.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.000
Then we have our first
lens of the 4F system.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.620
This is a non-magnifying
4F system,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.950
so these two lenses are
exactly the same focal length.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.170
So first lens.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.020
Then this is an aperture
in the Fourier plane

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.260
because we're going to start
with low-pass filtering.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.200
The second lens, and
then we're imaging this

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.010
into our detector, which
uses CCD seamless array.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.170
So now we're going to
switch to the camera

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.790
and start with a coherent case.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.440
So the first case, it's like
what we've seen in class.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.980
We're going to illuminate this
object with an inline plane

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.480
wave.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.740
OK, let me just zoom
in a little bit.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.210
So this is the
resolution target,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.130
and it's in imaging
condition, right?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.010
So the object is in the front
focal plane of the first lens,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.580
and the detector is in the back
focal plane of the second lens.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.940
So what you can see
here is we are actually

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.400
imaging all the way to
groups two and three.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.900
This resolution target
has lines even larger,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.400
which are one and two
that we don't see here.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.650
And the first thing we
see is the following.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.310
We see some fringes,
which are produced

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.860
by the interference
from the glass,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.500
so it's basically the reflection
of the plane waves interfering

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.340
with each other.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.760
So this is very typical
in coherent imaging.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.860
We see other rings that are
produced by dust particles

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.490
maybe along the way.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.360
So all these fringes right now
look destructive to the image,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.770
and perhaps they are for
certain applications.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.120
However, for those of you
doing digital holography,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.240
you notice that these fringes
contain a lot of information

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.030
that is encoded about the
amplitude and the phase

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.760
of the signal that
we can exploit.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.870
So just for
comparison, I'm going

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.030
to zoom in and see what is the
maximum that we can see here.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.100
So you can see that we can have
a resolution now that we know

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.770
what the optimal resolution.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.690
With good accuracy
we see maybe down

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.330
to this side of the
group number five.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.550
All right, so in the
homework we learned

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.673
about the low-pass
filtering in Fourier domain.

00:05:53.673 --> 00:05:55.090
So just to remind
you, essentially

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.120
what we're going to do
is that the first lens

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.980
is taking the Fourier
transform, and it

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.110
happens in the Fourier plane.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.260
So then in that plane
we put an aperture,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.630
centered, and then
what we do is we're

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.080
going to start reducing the
diameter of the aperture

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.930
to try to low-pass filter
the signal more and more.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.500
So what do we
expect to see here?

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.720
Well, you did it
in the p-set, so we

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.480
expect to see some blurring,
progressive blurring.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.160
So I'm going to do
it, and hopefully you

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.220
can see it from there.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.963
So right now it's all open,
and I'm going to blur it.

00:06:31.963 --> 00:06:33.130
So I'm going to do it again.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.150
This is clear.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.650
Blurry.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.590
So I'm controlling
with this iris.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.760
And you can see how the signal
that contains the higher

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.360
spatial frequency in
this area goes first,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.200
then this one and this one.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.850
But all of them now--

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.230
in this blurry condition,
if I try to zoom back again,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.220
now we see how the
signal is really blurry.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.430
If I open the aperture,
it becomes clear again.

00:07:12.268 --> 00:07:14.560
So now let's do the comparison
of the exact same thing.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.800
What would you think it would
happen if I switch illumination

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.300
now to incoherent light?

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.790
So I'm going to block the
coherent light here, and then

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.270
the first thing that we
notice is that we don't have

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.040
those fringes anymore, right?

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.400
So it looks like a
very clean image.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.680
So again, in this case,
you can think about

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.500
that for microscopy,
this is very nice.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.350
However, from the digital
holographic point of view,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.330
we don't have that
extra information

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.620
that we can use in
encoding of the signal.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.890
Now let me zoom in to compare
the resolution in this case.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.350
So you can see it's
hard to tell if we don't

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.900
do a quantitative study to see
exactly what is the smallest

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.500
line that we can
see in each case,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.230
but we can see the
comparison again

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.400
versus the resolution in the
coherent and incoherent cases.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.800
And now let's do the
low-pass filtering.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.140
So again, this aperture
right now is fully open,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.390
and then I started closing it.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.280
And I'm closing and
closing and closing it.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.630
Open again.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.470
Close it.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.820
So we see two things.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.809
Remember that the incoherent
system is basically regulated

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.685
by the OTF, as opposed to the
ATF in the coherent system.

00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:46.060
So now that you
can think of it--

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.230
the easy terms is it's a
[? combo ?] because the OTF is

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.510
a normalized cross
correlation of the ATF, which

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.450
means that when I
close this aperture,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.200
you can see how the
signal becomes weaker

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.950
and weaker because essentially
I'm restricting the DC

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.250
component that happens to
be in all the signal there,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.600
but also gets blurry.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.370
It's hard to see, but
it's getting blurry.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.780
It is getting blurry
at a different rate

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.710
as the other system.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.890
So now let's go to
high-pass filter,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.490
and I'm going to switch
back to the coherent case.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.900
So this is the coherent case.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.275
So right now what
I'm going to do

00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:36.640
is that I'm going to remove the
aperture in the Fourier plane,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.880
and I just did a very improvised
high-pass filter, which

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.150
basically is a microscope slide
that has a little piece of tape

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.020
in the center just to block the
basic component, or kind of,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.980
but anyways, it works.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.690
Somewhere around here--
let me crank up the light.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.770
And we can see how basically
we remove the DC term.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.090
And you see the high-pass
filtering effect,

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.480
which is essentially
accentuating

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.740
all the edges of the signal.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.070
Now I'm going to put
the incoherent case

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:39.697
and the coherent superimposed
just to show edge detection.

00:10:39.697 --> 00:10:40.780
So this is a normal thing.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.442
We can accentuate the edges.

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:43.900
So what is interesting
also here is

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.990
that if you move the
filter in different places,

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.890
you can, say, just
accentuate the edges

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.520
in the horizontal direction or
in the vertical direction, et

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.270
cetera, et cetera.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.270
We see that the
incoherent case, we

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.510
don't see the same effect,
which is as expected.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.850
Again, it's a normalized
cross correlation.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.780
But with a coherent case, we
do see these drastic change.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.480
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Thank you.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.110
Any questions about the demo or
about coherence, incoherence?

00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:54.330
AUDIENCE: How do you
tell whether something's

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.930
partially incoherent or
completely incoherent?

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.430
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, so the test

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.990
is with one of these
interferometers

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.020
that Se Baek showed last time.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.820
You basically measure
the fringe contrast.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.740
For example, if you're worried
about spatial coherence,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.590
you set up a [INAUDIBLE]
interferometer [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.380
and the fringe
visibility will tell you

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.000
the degree of coherence.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.518
If it is full contrast,
it is fully coherent.

00:12:20.518 --> 00:12:22.310
And of course, you
never see full contrast.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.290
You never see-- it's always
somewhere in between.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.170
OK, so today we'll
have a flashback

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.250
of geometrical optics.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:45.570
I will go back to something
we saw in geometrical optics,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.430
and that's the single
lens imaging system.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:53.910
Oh, and before I
forget, on Wednesday,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.900
it is the project presentation
for the graduate version

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.060
of the class, so I
wanted to remind you.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.630
I will also send an
email from the website,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.540
but if you haven't
done so already,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.570
you should have a meeting
with your project mentors,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.510
finalize your
presentations, and then

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.710
on Wednesday, what we'll do is
it'll be a conference style.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.110
Each group will have about
15 minutes, approximately 12

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.163
for the presentation,
approximately 3 for questions.

00:13:24.163 --> 00:13:24.830
How many groups?

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.330
I think we have six
or seven groups.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.300
So typically, these
things run over,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.080
so we'll take
probably the full two

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.750
hours with the presentations.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.790
So for those of you in the
2.71, you don't have to attend,

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.407
but I think it would be very
useful if you do because it's

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.240
sort of interesting.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.270
It is more advanced material.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.440
The graduate students
will present some topics

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.390
from current
literature, and you'll

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.170
get an idea not only over the
basic optics that we'll do here

00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:00.750
but also what kind of things
happen in the research front.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.050
For example, last
week several of us--

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.020
Pat, Yuan, and Sean--

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.560
were at the conference
in Vancouver,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.810
so some of the topics that
were represented on Wednesday

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.650
were actually big items
in the conference.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.500
The conference was
actually called Advances

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.580
in Imaging, this spring
congress of the optical society.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.080
Anyway.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.150
So going back to
the lecture, this

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.340
is something that
we've seen before,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.840
but with geometrical optics.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.000
Now we try to understand
how the same system works

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.160
but with the wave optics.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.560
And if I could have the
tablet again, please.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:53.290
So the way we analyze the
system, of course, is we'll

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.070
basically have to propagate
using Fresnel diffraction

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.370
to propagate the field from
one element to the next

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.510
until we reach the
end of the system.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.483
So for example, at the input
we have the input field.

00:15:06.483 --> 00:15:07.900
I will write it
in one [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.070
so we don't write too much.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.190
The input field is
simply the product

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:22.920
of the illumination field times
the complex transmittivity

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.750
of the input transparency.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:30.380
I will do everything
for a spatially coherent

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.600
illumination, and we know now
that if the illumination is

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.805
spatially incoherent,
if we have already

00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:39.680
solved the coherent
case, we're in good shape

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.735
because we can simply take the
modular square of the point

00:15:42.735 --> 00:15:44.360
spread function and
the autocorrelation

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.240
of the coherent amplitude
transfer function,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.520
and then we can compute the
correspondent quantities

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.710
for the incoherent case.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.350
So the coherent is the one
that we'll always start with.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.540
OK, so doing that now, we
can calculate, for example,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.280
the field immediately
to the left of the lens.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.650
So let's call it g
sub L minus for left,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:21.660
and I think I still use x
double prime as my coordinate.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.940
So this is now a Fresnel
propagated version

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.560
of the input field, so we'll
write out the big, bad Fresnel

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.680
integral.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.320
e the i 2 pi z1 over
lambda i lambda z1.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.080
So this is the
[? prequel, ?] and then we

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.400
write our big
integral here, g sub

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.340
in of x, and then the quadratic.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.250
And of course, two things
happen at the lens plane.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.840
First of all is the lens itself.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.900
That will impose an additional
quadratic phase delay

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.970
upon the signal, but
now it's a little bit

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.339
different than the
geometrical optics case.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.440
I forgot to mention
earlier that I

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:14.480
have added a thin transparency
in front of the lens.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.450
So this is again a pupil mask.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.400
As we will see in
a moment, it does

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.339
pretty much the same
job as the pupil mask

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:25.640
did at the Fourier plane of the
4F system, but in this case,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.067
we actually put it sort of
in contact with the lens.

00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:31.150
In fact, we don't have to.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.340
We can put the mask
anywhere we like,

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.690
but anyway, it makes the math
a bit simpler in this case.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.580
And in most implementations,
for practical reasons,

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.950
they also do it this way
because it is much better

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.410
to have everything
stacked together,

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.450
as opposed to having
different elements

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.070
sort of floating around
in an optical system.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.320
OK, so this means then that
the field to the right hand

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.310
side of the lens, so the
plus now means to the right,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.500
still x double
prime coordinates,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.040
is going to equal to
the field that was

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.480
on the left multiplied by 2.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.680
Two functions now.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.960
One is the thin
transparency itself,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.800
which I denote
there as g sub pm.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.720
pm, of course, stands
for pupil mask,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.570
like in the previous cases.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:25.730
And then times another
complex quadratic

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.860
exponential that corresponds
to the lens itself.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.880
So this would be e
to the minus i pi x

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.300
double prime square
upon lambda f,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.610
where f is the focal
length of the lens.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.565
And finally, the
field at the output.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.410
Now the output
coordinate is x prime.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.190
It's going to equal
another Fresnel propagation

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.250
from the pupil mask
to the output plain,

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.820
so I have to write another
propagation term here.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.470
This would be z2 this time.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:12.980
And what I will put now is gL
plus because this is the field

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.340
to the right of the right of
the composite lens and the pupil

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.990
mask, so that would be
x double prime and then

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.015
another quadratic exponential.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:42.978
OK, so this is it, and when
you plug in all this math--

00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:44.520
this is something
we've done already,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.380
so I will not do it
in the class again,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.000
but there is a supplement.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.400
There is a scan of
my handwritten notes

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.310
in the website where you will
see a little bit more detail

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.257
on how I did the
derivation here,

00:19:56.257 --> 00:19:58.090
but I will skip some
of the immediate steps,

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.110
and I will show the result here.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.590
So the way you handle this
kind of-- as you imagine,

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.360
when you combine all
of these integrals,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.700
you will get a sort of
integral that involves all

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.990
of these functions, g sub
in, g sub pm and so on,

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.060
but also you will have a bunch
of quadratic exponentials.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.480
So what you do is you
expand the exponents

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:26.620
of these exponentials,
and you rearrange terms,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.120
and you write it out this way.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.670
So these are the
output coordinates.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.720
They don't participate
in the integration,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.440
so we can knock them
out of the integral.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.020
And then of course, we cannot
do much about this thing

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.460
because, well, we don't know
what these functions are yet,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.940
but we can certainly try
to see what we can do with

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.150
the remainder.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:52.600
So what is sort of glaring
here is that in the exponent,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.650
you have quadratic terms, and
you also have linear terms.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.630
The linear terms, we
know from experience

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.030
that they lead into Fourier
transform, so they're nice.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.560
We'll know what to do with them.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.420
The quadratic
terms, they usually

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.960
correspond to nasty things like
the focus, but in this case,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.380
you can see that the
quadratic term is multiplied

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.990
by a coefficient
here, which allows

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.030
us to knock it out if
we select the distance

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.740
as z1 and z2 judiciously,
and of course that

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.290
is the result of the lens law.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.330
This is the same
equation that we

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.070
derived using
geometrical optics,

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.180
and we'll call it the
imaging condition.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.600
So you can see here that when
you satisfied this imaging

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.620
condition, then you essentially
knock out the focus term

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.450
from the diffraction integral.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.060
So that is gratifying
because we actually

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.390
derived a result from
geometrical optics,

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.510
but this time it is perhaps
more rigorous because it

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.328
is based on electromagnetics.

00:21:51.365 --> 00:21:52.240
What is the rest now?

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.880
Well, we'll deal with
the rest in a moment,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.710
but you see that there's another
quadratic here that we cannot

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:05.530
quite so easily get rid of,
and this extra quadratic that

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.750
popped up there is interesting
because it is not predicted

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.900
by geometrical optics.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.988
So this is something that--

00:22:13.988 --> 00:22:16.030
well, it will happen only
with spatially coherent

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:21.750
illumination, and geometrical
optics cannot predict it

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.560
and actually cannot
deal with it.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.830
And in fact, not so
long ago, about the time

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.793
I was born in the
early '70s, this

00:22:29.793 --> 00:22:31.960
was a topic of research,
what to do about this term.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.550
In fact, Professor Goodman,
who wrote your textbook, one

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.680
of his early results
as a young scientist,

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.160
he wrote the famous
paper about this term,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.120
what this term means.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:46.828
And he wrote it--

00:22:46.828 --> 00:22:50.140
I believe he wrote it in 1971,
exactly the year I was born.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.750
I'm not that old, so I
guess that you can still

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.300
call it a relatively
recent development.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.980
So again, we're talking
about this term over here,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.290
what to do about this one.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:08.650
And then of course, there's
an entire section in Goodman

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.050
that talks about this
term, and I would encourage

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.480
you to read the section.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.120
I will show a summary here.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.705
Something got messed up that
with my animations here.

00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:20.580
This was not supposed
to be here, but anyway.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.750
So Goodman actually
goes over three methods

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.440
that you can use to eliminate
this unwanted quadratic.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.180
One of them is you lay out the
input transparency as a sphere,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.680
or in a spherical
surface, instead

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.210
of the typical planar surface.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.710
That may sound a
little bit strange,

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.992
and it's probably very difficult
to implement in practice,

00:23:43.992 --> 00:23:45.450
but conceptually
you can see what's

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.440
going on because now these
points in the transparency

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.930
start with an
original phase delay,

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.700
you can work out the
curvature right here.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.075
In fact, the
curvature would have

00:23:55.075 --> 00:23:57.480
to be exactly z1, the
areas of curvature,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.760
so that it cancels this
unwanted quadratic.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.770
So that's one way.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.590
The second way is
to actually stick

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.830
a lens in front of
the transparency.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:12.390
This is actually very often done
in geometrical optics as well.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.890
This is called the
condenser lens.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.130
So for example, we
don't have this anymore,

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.710
but actually, we do have
one in the classroom.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.330
We used to use these projectors.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.650
Basically, if you look at the
top surface of this projector--

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.450
I don't know if I can
take it out here--

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.790
but if you look at it,
it's actually a lens.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.570
After class, come over and look.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:39.240
There is grooves on
it, and basically,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.590
sort of the grooves implement
equivalent of a lens surface.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:56.730
If you do the operation modulo
2 pi on the surface of the lens,

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.350
instead of having this
surface that we typically

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.867
think of as a lens, if you
do a modulo 2 pi operation,

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:05.700
you will get something
like this, of course.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.800
OK, so that's a way
to make a thin lens.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.050
That is called a condenser.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.520
The reason we put
it in a projector

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.530
is not to eliminate
this quadratic factor,

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:29.750
it is simply because it makes
the illumination uniform.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.143
So when you project
the slide on--

00:25:32.143 --> 00:25:33.560
I don't know if
you guys are maybe

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.480
too young to have
ever seen anything

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.002
like this in operation, but
the next time if I remember,

00:25:38.002 --> 00:25:39.710
I'll bring an old
fashioned transparency,

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.260
and I will show you
how people of my age

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.820
used to give talks
at conferences

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.040
when we didn't have PowerPoint.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.350
But anyway, this is done
actually very commonly,

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.300
to stick a lens in front of--

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.707
just attached to a thin object.

00:25:55.707 --> 00:25:57.540
But there are some cases
you cannot do that.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.957
For example, in
the microscope, it

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:00.890
is very difficult
to imagine sticking

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.640
a lens behind the glass slide.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.890
So in some cases,
this is applicable,

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:07.960
and in some it is not.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.720
Anyway, a big application
of this type of lens

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.120
is of course in
overhead projectors.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.830
Does anybody know
another application

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.630
where people use
this kind of lenses,

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.527
or what might motivate you
to make this kind of lens?

00:26:21.527 --> 00:26:22.110
Can you think?

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.170
These lenses are commonly used--

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:30.980
actually, you know?

00:26:33.887 --> 00:26:35.470
AUDIENCE: Do they
sometimes stick them

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.413
on the backs of vans or
cars to make it wide angle?

00:26:38.413 --> 00:26:40.080
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right, yeah.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.160
That's another application.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.163
Exactly, to improve the
rear view of the driver.

00:26:46.163 --> 00:26:47.080
And that's a good one.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.330
I wasn't thinking of that.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:54.970
Yet another one is in very
high power illuminators,

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:59.350
which are most commonly used in
photography in shooting movies

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:06.460
because the glass, as you know,
is not a very good conductor,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.610
so it would hit up very
badly if you illuminate

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.590
with very high power.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.350
They're called,
actually, babies,

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.830
these really big
light bulbs that they

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.780
use when they shoot movies.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.490
So they actually use these.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.590
It is called a Fresnel
lens, the same Fresnel

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.550
lens in Fresnel propagation.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:34.280
So they use the Fresnel lenses
in these so-called babies.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.170
All right.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.200
And lighthouses also, yeah.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.890
So again, every time that
you have a really huge light

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.390
source.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.598
Of course, it's a matter of
practicality also, right?

00:27:45.598 --> 00:27:48.680
If you have a major
lens, as you can imagine,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.470
if the diameter is big,
then also this size

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.750
would also be very big, right?

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.170
So in a lighthouse,
you might have

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.980
a lens that is maybe 1
or 2 meters in diameter,

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.947
then it would have to bulge
over another half meter or so.

00:28:00.947 --> 00:28:02.030
That's not very practical.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.252
It is heavy, fragile,
blah blah blah.

00:28:04.252 --> 00:28:06.710
So they make the Fresnel lenses
to get around this problem.

00:28:09.805 --> 00:28:11.420
A good thing to
remember about those

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.330
is that they generally give
very poor image quality.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.850
So if you try to use
this as an imaging lens,

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:23.180
you typically get a very bad
blur and a very bad image

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.530
quality, but obviously in the
lighthouse you don't care.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.540
In an illuminator,
you don't care.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.470
And also the projector, it is
not used as an imaging lens.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.990
The imaging lens is a
real lens, this one.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.270
This is simply collimating
the illumination

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:43.220
so you get a uniform
image at the image plane.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.890
So for jobs like this
one where you basically

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.830
want to take a light bulb
that is highly un-uniform.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.300
It has filaments,
all kinds of crap.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.080
So this is a very
nonuniform field.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.200
This type of lens is
very good to uniformize

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.940
the intensity,
and then of course

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.343
if you need to image
a sharp object,

00:29:01.343 --> 00:29:02.510
then you need the real lens.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.550
You cannot get around that.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.540
OK, that's a bit
about Fresnel lenses.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.180
So that's a bit
of a detour, but I

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.760
wanted to point out
some practical ways

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.030
that you might be able
to do this kind of thing

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.860
if you need to get
rid of the lens.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.980
And finally, what John Goodman
proved back when he was young

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.710
is that there's a
condition that you can

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.453
neglect this nasty quadratic.

00:29:31.453 --> 00:29:33.120
Again, we're talking
about the quadratic

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.330
that you see at the
top of the slide.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:41.280
So it turns out if the
field of the object--

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.950
when we say the field,
sometimes in geometrical optics

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.000
we mean the size of this.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.950
So if the field is smaller
than about a quarter

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.220
of the imaging lens,
then it turns out again

00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:01.380
that the effects of this
term are negligible,

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.680
and therefore we can get rid
of it in clear conscience.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.580
So I will not go
into the details.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.140
There is discussion
in the book and also

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.830
reference 303 from
the book is an article

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.040
that Goodman wrote
back then, and he

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.140
goes into this in a
little bit more detail.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.622
It's a pretty
interesting article.

00:30:21.622 --> 00:30:23.830
I'm going to leave a post
on the website if you like.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.520
It's pretty interesting to read.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.580
So assuming then that will get
rid of this extra quadratic--

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.450
let me go back one.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.820
So we got rid of one
quadratic from the lens law,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.560
and I spent a lot of time
arguing about this quadratic,

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.200
that maybe you can
get rid of that

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.980
then as well, assuming you
can get rid of that as well.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.930
Well, anyway, even
if we don't get rid

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.290
of that, what is left in here
is actually Fourier transform.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.060
I think I pointed
that out before.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.290
A Fourier transform-- why?

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.480
Because you have
linear now, linear

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.520
exponents times
some coefficient,

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.580
and then here you
have the pupil mask.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.330
So again you recognize
something familiar.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.210
The same thing happened in
the case of the 4F system.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.580
We again got a
term like this one,

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.690
but it was slightly different.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.660
Instead of z1 z2 in
the denominators here,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.880
it had f1 and f2, the
two focal lengths.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.210
Here we have the two distances,
but it's pretty much the same,

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.680
and again the pupil mask
appeared in the kernel here.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.130
So this is a Fourier
transform, and of course we

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.890
get rid of this term, and let
me jump through these animations

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.390
now.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.010
OK, so if we're doing that,
then what we finally get

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:54.480
is this expression
here, where, again, this

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.690
is the Fourier transform
of the pupil mask.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.540
I wrote it in a form that
looks a bit more like a Fourier

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.360
transform, and of course u and
v are now arbitrary arguments.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360
These are the spatial
frequencies in the Fourier

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.720
transform, but what
actually goes in there

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.390
is these parameters over here.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.550
So basically we get again a term
that looks like a convolution.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:23.930
So we see that the image,
the complex optical field

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:32.260
at the image is a convolution of
the input field times something

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.555
that again we will call
the point spread function.

00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:37.180
And this point spread
function, just as

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.210
in the case of the 4F system,
again here the point spread

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.050
function is given as the
Fourier transform over

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.830
the pupil of the
pupil mask scaled

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.200
with appropriate coordinates.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.520
OK, and there is various
scaling forms and factors here.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.570
For example, this one again
ensures energy conservation,

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.140
which is kind of
important, but very often

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.270
in optics we don't care so much
about the absolute intensities,

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.850
which means that we don't
really care about this term.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.720
What we really care about is
about the spatial distribution,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.560
like the type we're solving,
whether features make it

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.830
to the image or they get
lost due to spatial filtering

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.860
and so on and so forth.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.360
So very often these
multiplicative constants,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.880
we just drop them.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.560
That's sort of convention.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.520
Now, to get a little
more insight out of this,

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:38.000
imagine for a moment that
the point spread function

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.620
becomes extremely narrow.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.240
It becomes a delta function.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.330
So if you substitute
the delta function

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.130
into the expression
we had before,

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.780
then you get this
expression, which

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.780
is of course again
very gratifying

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.300
because now the output
really looks like,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.720
again, some multiplicative
term, but then it really looks

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.500
like the input,
except in the input

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.870
now, the coordinates
have been scaled,

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.120
so therefore you can immediately
see that this term is

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.210
the magnification.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.239
In fact, the lateral
magnification of the system

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.960
is given by this expression.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.739
So we basically
rederived the same result

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:21.290
that we got from
geometrical optics--

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.469
namely, the lens law that
is the imaging condition,

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.300
the magnification and
so on and so forth.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.480
Now we've got them back from
our wave optics approach,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.219
but we had to do
some approximations.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.280
For example, we had to
pretend that the point spread

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.020
function is a delta
function in order

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.688
to get the geometrical
optics result. If it's not,

00:34:41.688 --> 00:34:42.980
which is never the case, right?

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.679
Delta function is a
very good approximation.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:50.270
So if it's not a delta
function, then the result

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.940
is not exactly like this,
but it is a convolution.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.550
That is, basically this
will become blurry.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.650
Like [? Pepe ?] showed earlier,
you will get a blurred vision--

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.040
or in general, an
especially filtered version

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.080
of the original
input will actually

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.270
survive through to the output.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.510
What I would like
to point out now,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.940
this is something that I
believe Se Baek also showed

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.360
last time, the same slide.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.750
What I would like to
do is basically pay

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.080
a little bit of attention
to the scaling factors here.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.450
These scaling factors are
actually very important.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:34.530
So I mentioned that to drop
multiplicative factors that

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.150
appear in the front here.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.103
This, it is OK to drop,
but these scaling factors

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.520
that go inside the
argument, these

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.080
are very important
because they determine

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:48.240
the amount of spatial filtering
that goes on inside the system.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.770
So what I will do
actually for a while

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:54.170
is I will compare the 4F
system with a single lens

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.180
similar system.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.180
So the scale factors,
again, they are different.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:03.470
You see f1 is inside the
transfer function, and z1

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.160
in the case of the single lens.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.950
So what is the
effect of that one?

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:10.390
Also in the incoherent case.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.730
Of course, in the
incoherent case,

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.540
the transfer function
is the autocorrelation

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.220
of the coherent
transfer function,

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.380
and since the coherent
transfer function is basically

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.430
proportional to the
pupil mask, then what

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.060
we call the optical transfer
function, the incoherent case,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.520
is an autocorrelation of
the pupil mask itself.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.780
This is again a very basic
result, but again, be careful.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.390
When we compute these
autocorrelations,

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.880
we have to apply
different scaling factors

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.210
in the argument.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.710
OK.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.650
So I will show in a second how
this works, and I will show it

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.360
in two cases.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.895
One is what we called before
the Zernike phase mask.

00:36:53.895 --> 00:36:55.520
Actually, this is
not exactly accurate.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.355
Zernike did not
invent exactly this.

00:36:57.355 --> 00:37:00.395
He invented another one
that has pi over 2 phase

00:37:00.395 --> 00:37:01.300
shift at the edges.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.290
It's like a ring.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.360
But anyway, the
function is the same,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:09.220
so everybody refers to all of
these types of masks as Zernike

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.080
nowadays.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:11.980
So this is familiar.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.320
We saw a few
examples in the past

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.570
when it was in the middle in the
focal plane of the 4F system,

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:24.950
and this is the case when
we put it as a pupil mask

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.510
in a single lens system.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.100
It's the same mask.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.100
It will do a very similar
thing, but there's

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.110
a subtle difference, so this
is what I want to point out.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.920
So this is the
subtle difference.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.960
What you see here is, of
course, the schematics,

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.320
so you see it is opaque
outside some amplitude.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.930
Then inside, you have
this little extra phase

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:48.730
delay near the optical
access in a small region.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.430
And OK, this is the
mathematical expression

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.050
that I don't want to dwell upon.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.460
I'd rather focus on
these plots here.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:01.450
So these two plots
are the magnitude

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:03.550
and the phase of the mask.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.200
So the magnitude is the top.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.680
The blue plot it
goes from 0 to 1.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.800
So it is 1 within the amplitude,
so let's see if that's correct.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.380
The amplitude has a
size of 1 centimeter,

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.060
so indeed this is 1
between minus 0.5 and 0.5.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.190
And the phase, well, the phase,
nobody knows what the phase is.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.450
Where the magnitude
is zero, we can not

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.810
define the phase for a complex
number that equals zero.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.810
Nevertheless, let's
set it equal to zero.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.470
But what I want to emphasize
is that within the past band

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:40.360
of the system, the phase is
0, except for a small chunk

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.730
of width of 0.2
centimeters where

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.230
the phase jumps to pi over 2.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.570
Pi over 2 is of course i.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.490
And this is the real
and imaginary part.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.350
These two are
actually equivalent.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:58.030
So the real part,
it is 1, except at

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.500
the little extra phase
protrusion there where

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.350
the real part goes to 0,
and the imaginary part

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:12.010
becomes 1 because of course
when the phase equals pi over 2,

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.010
then the actual complex
amplitude equals i.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.170
So that's what you see here.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:22.570
So these two pairs describe
both of the phase mask.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.550
So the [INAUDIBLE] transfer
functions of course

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.250
are the same.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.730
I only plotted them here as
a real and imaginary part,

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.570
but they have the same shape.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.330
What is really different--
and unfortunately,

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.240
my plot is a little
bit too small here.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.620
You cannot see very well--

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.810
is that they actually
have different sizes.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.430
This one, if you do the scaling
factors here for the numbers

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.815
that I used, I think I used--

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.870
so I used lambda
equals 1 micron.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:07.880
Lambda equals 1 micron,
f1 equals 10 centimeters,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.210
f2 equals 1 centimeter
for the 4F system.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:15.630
And then z1 equals
11 centimeters,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:23.750
z2 equals 1.1 centimeters, and
f1 equals still 10 centimeters

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.060
for the single lens.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.050
And I worked those out
so that in both cases,

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.570
you get the demagnification
of a factor of 10.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:33.100
That's why the numbers are
a little bit strange there.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.057
So in both cases, you get a
demagnification factor of 10,

00:40:36.057 --> 00:40:38.390
and I did that deliberately
because the two systems give

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.060
you the same effect
kind of, but you

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.940
can see in terms of geometrical
optics, they are identical.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.070
They both give you
a demagnification

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.518
by a factor of 10,
but you see here

00:40:48.518 --> 00:40:50.060
that in terms of
wave optics, they're

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.430
slightly different
because one of them,

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.160
the 4F system is scaled
by the focal length.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.290
Its spatial frequency
extends, goes

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.650
from minus 50 to 50
inverse millimeters.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.450
This is what you see here.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.960
Whereas in this case, it goes
from approximately minus 48

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.020
to 48 inverse millimeters.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.610
So the single lens actually
does a slightly more severe

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:20.428
spatial filter than the
case of the 4F system.

00:41:20.428 --> 00:41:22.720
That is to be expected, of
course, because the distance

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.240
z1--

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.880
you can see from here--

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:34.520
the distance z1 that you subtend
from the object to the aperture

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.710
is longer, so
therefore this system

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.830
is cutting off more
angles, or more spatial

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.100
frequencies than this system.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.980
We will see that in
more detail in a second.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.730
The other thing I want
to point out to you

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.390
is that if you take
that autocorrelation

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.380
of this function, which
is the coherent transfer

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.070
function or the ATF, if you
take its autocorrelation,

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:03.930
you obtain the OTF, which is, as
Se Baek demonstrated last time,

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.230
it is the transfer
function for spatially

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.060
incoherent illumination.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.130
So again, this is a
little bit of an exercise

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:15.720
that I will not do here,
but it is in the notes.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.230
I have posted another
set of practice problems.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:23.180
So it is in pages 16
and 17 of the last set

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.140
of practice problems.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.120
I have gone ahead
and derived this one,

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.360
and I would encourage
you to go through.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.700
It's a little bit
of algebra, but you

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.610
can think of it as
mental fitness right

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.210
because you might say, why do
I need to do all this algebra?

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.540
When would I ever have
to do so much algebra?

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.670
I can just plug it into
Matlab, and I get it.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.290
Well, I'm sure all of you
do some kind of fitness.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.332
You go to the gym, right?

00:42:46.332 --> 00:42:48.860
When you do bench presses,
what is the probability

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.290
that you need to do a bench
press motion in real life?

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.940
It's actually very small.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.370
So you do bench presses
in order to keep fit.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.650
So the reason we do these
kind of calculations

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.260
is it's the equivalent of
mental bench presses, right,

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.760
so I would encourage
you to do it.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.010
Because presumably you are
at MIT because you have you

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.830
want to have mental fitness
as well as physical fitness.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.110
Let me talk a little bit more
about these scaling factors.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.580
So in this case, this is just a
clear aperture that I put here,

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.980
and you can see that in the
case of the clear aperture,

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.950
it's actually very easy to
do sort of the ray diagrams,

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.470
and you can see also here that--

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.810
well, let me back
up for a second.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.810
So you remember from
geometrical optics,

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.850
we had the definition of
the numerical aperture.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:47.140
So we defined the numerical
aperture as the angle

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.740
that we subtend towards
the optical system

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.460
if we place a point
source on axis.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.570
So therefore, the
numerical aperture

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.680
is limited by one of the
physical apertures that

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.040
are in the system.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.450
So in the case of the 4F system,
that would be the pupil mask.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.270
At some point in
any physical system,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.920
the pupil mask
cannot be infinite.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.890
It has to be finite, so the
physical diameter of the pupil

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:16.180
mask, assuming the lenses
themselves are large enough,

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.130
the pupil mask will become
the limiting factor.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.040
And so we can compute the
numerical aperture then.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:27.430
It is the ratio of
the radius of the mask

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.110
over the focal length, f1.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:33.460
You can see it very easily
from this triangle over here.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.840
And of course this is an
approximate expression.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.180
In reality, the
numerical apertures

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.250
would be the sine over
the inverse tangent

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.200
of this quantity,
but of course we're

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.730
doing [INAUDIBLE]
approximations here,

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.950
so we can drop the
trigonometric functions.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:01.050
In the case of the single lens
the numerical aperture is--

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.290
again, you can get it from
this triangle over here,

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:09.975
but now the one of the
orthogonal sides is z1, not f1.

00:45:09.975 --> 00:45:11.850
So you can see that the
numerical aperture is

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:18.630
r over z1, and of course if this
system is supposed to produce

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.350
a real image, as opposed
to a virtual image,

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.290
then z1 must be longer than f1.

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.010
You can see very clearly
from the imaging condition,

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.460
1 over z1 plus 1 over
z2 equals 1 over f.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.170
If you want z2 to be positive--

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:40.200
so for z2 to be positive, it
means I have a real image--

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.060
for this, it is required
that z1 is bigger than f.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.780
So because of that, you can see
that if you have the same size

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.810
pupil mask, the single lens
system would have a smaller

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.400
numerical aperture.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.240
That is sort of an
unfortunate fact of life.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.650
So another thing I
want to point out here

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.620
is that the numerical
aperture actually

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.350
changes when you go to the
second leg of the system

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.110
because, of course, the system
has angular magnification.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:14.130
So what started as a numerical
aperture at the input

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:16.230
is of course an angle.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.570
If you take the
marginal ray, it is

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.700
propagating at a given
angle with respect

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.940
to the optical axis.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.410
By the time it comes out,
this angle will have changed.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:26.100
By how much?

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.070
By the angular
magnification of the system.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.090
So therefore, the numerical
aperture at the output

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:32.970
is not the same.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.800
It equals the numerical aperture
at the input times the angular

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.910
magnification of the system.

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.810
So this is not a
cause for confusion.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.380
We can use either one.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.490
We'll get actually the
same conclusions whether we

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.010
use the numerical
aperture or the input

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.470
or the numerical
aperture at the output,

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.090
but we have to be a
little bit careful

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.340
that we don't confuse
things, as long

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.800
as we remember this
simple relationship

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.120
that the two are connected
by the angular magnification.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.560
So the reason the numerical
aperture is so important is

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.088
because if you consider
a circular-- of course,

00:47:13.088 --> 00:47:14.380
you cannot see the circle here.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.820
This is just the projection.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:20.590
But imagine that I
have a circular pupil.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.290
Then recall that the point
spread function of the system

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.270
is actually the
Fourier transform

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:29.770
of that circular pupil because
this is a clear aperture now.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.860
And we learned sometime ago--

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.120
I don't remember when--

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.130
but we learned that
the Fourier transform

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:41.180
of a circular function
is this crazy [? zinc ?]

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.310
so-called function that is given
by a ratio of a Bessel function

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.220
to its argument, and
it's probably better

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.560
to think of it as a
plot like this one that

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.790
has a main lobe and then
a smaller side lobe.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:55.490
And actually, it
has a lot of lobes.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:48:00.340
It continues on forever, but the
size of the lobes decays away.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.810
How fast it decays away
is 1 over the argument.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:08.988
So what I want to point out
here is that in both cases,

00:48:08.988 --> 00:48:10.780
the point spread the
function of the system

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.390
looks like this
[? zinc ?] functions.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.245
Sometimes it's also
known as an Airy disk.

00:48:16.245 --> 00:48:17.620
Not an Airy
function, by the way.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.380
Airy function is different.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:24.313
This one is referred
to as Airy disk.

00:48:24.313 --> 00:48:25.980
If you're curious
what Airy function, is

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.930
you can open the
table of formulas.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.810
Abramowitz and [INAUDIBLE],, and
you'll see a monstrous thing.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.935
That's called the Airy
function, and this turns out

00:48:32.935 --> 00:48:35.070
to be a special case
of an Airy function.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:38.410
But anyway, this
is the Airy disk,

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.190
and what I want to emphasize
is that in both cases,

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.650
you get the same shape of Airy
disk, but different in size.

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:51.040
And you'll get different size
because in the case of the 4F

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:56.690
system, the size of the
aperture is the same,

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.260
but because the scaling
factor is smaller--

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:04.090
it is f1-- then you
actually get a bigger ATF.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.980
The size of the disk in the
frequency domain is bigger.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.980
Therefore, it will give you a
slightly narrower point spread

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.750
function.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:17.260
If you work out these
ratios over here,

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.760
and you work out
these coefficients,

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.190
you will see that
very clearly, but I

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.500
want you to get it
sort of intuitively

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.910
by using the scaling theorem
of Fourier transform.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:31.510
In both cases, you start with
the same physical aperture,

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.780
but what matters is not the
physical size of the aperture,

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.490
but the numerical aperture.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:40.860
So in one case, you have
this numerical aperture.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.750
This is a f1.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:44.950
This is the physical size,
and numerical aperture

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.240
is R over f1.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.570
In the other case, you have
again the same aperture,

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:55.220
but now you have a
longer distance here.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.500
This is still R. So now
the numerical aperture

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.430
would be R over z1.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:05.030
So the same physical
aperture in the two cases

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:09.020
will actually give you a
different size in the ATF.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.475
This will have a bigger ATF.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.350
So the size of the ATF,
if you work it out,

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:26.680
it will be proportional to
actually 1 over lambda f1,

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.220
and the size of the ATF here--

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.230
I'm exaggerating, of course--

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:35.140
will be proportional
to 1 over lambda z1.

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:44.080
OK, so since we've got the
smaller size of the ATF

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.120
in this case, it means that
we'll get a broader PSF.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.220
So which system is better?

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.630
Well, obviously this
one because this one

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.610
will give you a narrower PSF.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:57.260
Therefore, it will give
you a smaller blur.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.510
So of course there's a caveat.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:01.360
I sort of took it for
granted that the desirable

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.210
in an optical system is to
minimize the blur, which

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.800
in most cases it's true.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.990
If for some reason someone
asked you deliberately

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:10.750
to produce a system that
causes a lot of blur,

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:13.600
then of course you would go for
this one, but in most cases,

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.910
we try to minimize blur.

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:19.300
So this means, given
our resources--

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.410
that is, given our physical
size of the numerical aperture--

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:27.008
we should try to maximize
the numerical aperture,

00:51:27.008 --> 00:51:28.800
and that is what the
photo system is doing.

00:51:34.702 --> 00:51:36.910
So there are a few comments
about the resolution that

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.200
are in the rest of the slides.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.242
I don't want to destroy
the rest of your morning.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:47.930
Because the PSF
is finite, you can

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.520
imagine that if
you have two point

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.213
sources that are at distance.

00:51:51.213 --> 00:51:52.630
So now this is
like an experiment.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.950
I'm moving two point
sources together.

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.410
There will come a point
where the two point

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.120
sources will merge.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.730
And if this is
your image now, you

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:05.067
don't really know whether you
had one point source or two.

00:52:05.067 --> 00:52:06.650
Now, of course you
say, well, you also

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:08.030
get twice the intensity.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.520
That's true, but very
often you don't know

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.940
the intensity you started with.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.180
For example, if you're
looking at the sky,

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.680
and you're looking
at the bright dot

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.770
and you're trying to decide,
is it one star or two stars?

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.160
Well, so far we cannot yet
go to the stars and measure

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.020
their brightness, right?

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.700
We can only measure
the total brightness

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.192
that we receive here.

00:52:27.192 --> 00:52:29.150
So therefore, if you're
looking at a telescope,

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:31.850
and you see this, you
don't know if there's

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:36.380
one star or two stars that
are too close to be resolved

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.480
by your telescope.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.000
So actually, this
sort of situation

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.550
was dealt with by a fellow
called Rayleigh, and of course,

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.280
the size of the
PSF, as I worked out

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.960
before, it depends on
the numerical aperture.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.950
So I will go over
this in more detail

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.990
later, but this
is just a preview

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:00.605
that the numerical aperture
actually gives you an idea--

00:53:00.605 --> 00:53:02.480
I actually believe also
Professor [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.520
mentioned it in one
of the past lectures.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.040
The numerical aperture
gives you an idea

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.980
about the capability of your
system to resolve point images.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.890
So imagine that each
one of these lobes

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.190
here corresponds to the point
spread function of one point

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.360
object.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.300
So in this case, they were
resolved because I spaced them

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:28.580
so that the diameter
of the main lobe

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.570
falls exactly on one
null of the other lobe.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.700
So if you work it out,
and you take into care

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:38.000
into where the zeros
of the Bessel function

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.830
are located and
so on, you come up

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:41.880
with an expression
that looks like this.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.760
The space in between
the two sources

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.210
is 1.22 times the
wavelength divided

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.130
by the numerical aperture.

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:53.510
And of course this would
be at the input plane.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:57.980
So this would be the spacing
at the input required

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.740
so that the two sources
can be resolved.

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:04.400
But when you look at the
output, the distance of course

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.980
would be given by a
similar expression,

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.680
but the numerical
aperture at the output

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.330
would appear in this case.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.720
And of course this is sort of
the most common definition.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.120
Some books define
the resolution--

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.430
instead of the diameter,
they use the radius,

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.550
so they come up with an
expression that is exactly 1/2.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:23.960
Which one is
correct, it actually

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.190
depends on your requirements.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.700
If you require a
very crisp image,

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.195
or if you're dealing with
a very noisy situation,

00:54:33.195 --> 00:54:34.820
then you go for this
one because as you

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.380
can imagine if you organize
noise into this one,

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.870
then it becomes
progressively more

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.480
difficult to resolve
the two spots.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.190
So in a very noisy
environment, when

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.840
you have a very
little light, then

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.088
you go for this definition.

00:54:46.088 --> 00:54:47.630
If you have plenty
of light, then you

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.690
can possibly resolve two sources
that are very close like this,

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.190
right.

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:53.210
Here you see you have
very poor contrast.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.800
You basically have to rely--

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.300
in order to resolve
the two sources,

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.610
you have to rely on this
little dip in density.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:02.120
So if your signal is
noisy, this may be lost,

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.277
and then you cannot
resolve anymore.

00:55:04.277 --> 00:55:05.860
OK, so that's a
preview of resolution.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.400
We'll talk about this
a little bit more.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.050
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:30.970
I know we're sort of getting
into the middle of the week.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.610
Some of you maybe want to
keep your laptops open to work

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.890
on other courses'
midterms, but I

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.940
will ask you to try to focus
on Blockchain and Money today.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.610
Today, we're going to
chat about permissioned

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.762
versus permissionless systems.

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:49.470
I want to thank--

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.060
I have a guest here.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.740
I call out guest when
they're here and I know them.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.060
Mark Snyderman, who runs
a fund at Fidelity--

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.110
Mark runs a 6--
about $6 billion?

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.725
Called the Real Estate
Income Fund at Fidelity.

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:07.100
And you might say,
well, why does

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.725
he want to come to a
Blockchain and Money course?

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:11.600
It's because we went to
high school together.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.490
So-- and I was at his wedding.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.120
And he's getting
married again next week.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.620
Yeah.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.750
But you can all inundate
Mark later about Fidelity,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.560
because he's been there
for a lot of years.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.510
See what I'm going to do?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.650
I'm shamelessly for
MIT and MIT students.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.790
So let's get going.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.380
I was letting a little bit
of time for a few more people

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.820
to wander in.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.120
Today, we're going to talk--

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.960
of course, we're going to chat
a little bit about the readings

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.610
and study questions.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.200
Going to go back
again to, what are

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.430
the technical and
commercial challenges?

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.100
And this is relative--

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.770
this is relevant for
all of our lectures,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.780
but it's particularly
relevant today,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.479
because we're going to
be talking about two

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.820
different database structures.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.490
One's the permissionless
blockchain of Bitcoin.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.370
But now, today, we're going
to introduce and go deeper

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.330
into the permissioned, or
private, set of blockchains,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.920
like the IBM
Hyperledger and Corda.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.163
But the technical issues
relate to all of that.

00:02:30.163 --> 00:02:31.830
And then, of course,
we're going to talk

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.090
about that against a
third type of database--

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.680
traditional databases.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.520
So aligning permissionless,
like Bitcoin, permissioned--

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.130
IBM Hyperledger type of--

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.760
and then traditional databases,
and why, in a business setting,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.300
you might think of one versus
another versus another.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.060
And I'm sure if I run
off the rails anywhere

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.370
on traditional databases, which
I have not personally studied,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.480
Alon will help bail
me out somewhere.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.950
Is that a deal?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.450
Maybe?

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.755
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:05.630
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.653
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.070
AUDIENCE: You asked for it.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I asked for it.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.640
Mark, Alon is a
computer scientists

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.720
from other parts of MIT, so
he helps me out in subjects

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.900
I don't know, and even in
subjects I think I know.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.700
So let's just start a
little bit with what did you

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.717
take from the readings?

00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:31.550
There were four or five
readings, of course.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.810
But what is a permissioned or
private distributed ledger?

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.080
Now, I can do this.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.590
I can light them up, as some
people said, because Toledo's

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.940
given me my list.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.540
But again, class participation--
anybody who hasn't spoken yet

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.930
might want to sort of chime
in and give it a shot.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.195
I'm not seeing any volunteers.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:55.560
If I can-- ooh, yes.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.790
Do you want to tell me
your first name again?

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.880
AUDIENCE: Jayati

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.710
PROFESSOR: Jayati.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.520
AUDIENCE: Jayati.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.980
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.480
AUDIENCE: So the
permissioned DODs,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.520
unlike the permissioned
[INAUDIBLE] Bitcoin,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.880
they limit the number
of participants.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.770
Essentially, they
require the participants

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.079
to be authorized
before they can enter

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.110
into this sort of technology.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.640
And in addition to that, they
are said to be stakeholders.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.350
And since they are
the only ones involved

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.860
in verifying the transaction--

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.540
unlike the permissionless
ones, where

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.270
it has to be verified
at all the nodes,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.680
this limits the
permissions required

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.230
[INAUDIBLE] stakeholders,
which increases,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.630
also, the transaction speed.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.320
So it's like the
triangular dilemma

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.770
we learned about, about the
security and decentralization

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.200
and scalability.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.690
So it moves away
from decentralization

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.937
and towards scalability.

00:04:57.937 --> 00:04:58.520
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.112
So Jayeta--

00:05:02.112 --> 00:05:03.360
AUDIENCE: Jayehta.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.230
PROFESSOR: Jayeta went
through a whole lot.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.950
It's about the number of
nodes and permissioned

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.950
into it, and that
it addresses some

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.820
of that Buterin's trilemma.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.720
So at its core, it
sort of addresses

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.890
some of the scalability issues.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.460
But it does that at a trade
off that it's not truly open.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.370
It's not, anyone can
write to the ledger.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.630
I mean, that's sort of
the fundamental things.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.910
Anything else that folks
took out of the core readings

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.750
as to how it separates
and how it's different?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.480
I mean-- all right.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.640
We'll get a chance
to add a little bit.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.790
And then we're going to dive
into Hyperledger and Corda

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.670
a bit.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.460
We'll talk about
Digital Asset Holdings.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.750
What's Digital Asset Holdings?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.535
Anybody know this company?

00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:00.380
Alon knows it.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.320
Brotish knows it.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.592
Eilon.

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:05.364
So Eilon.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.207
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:10.040
It's basically a
competitor of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.890
They're trying to build
a DLT protocol that

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.590
will allow financial
institutions to exchange

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.180
information and value.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.280
And they started,
to my understanding,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.480
in 2016, which is two
years after R3 Corda funded

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.310
by [INAUDIBLE]
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.170
They're basically the same
amount of money-- $110 million.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.860
PROFESSOR: And who,
other than Alon

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.350
can tell me who runs
Digital Asset Holdings?

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.262
Just, it shows that
you did the reading.

00:06:39.262 --> 00:06:40.820
Somebody out there.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.320
Yes.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.820
Priya?

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.600
AUDIENCE: It was--

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.840
AUDIENCE: Priya.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.920
Blythe Mas-- Blythe
Masters, or Blythe--

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.090
PROFESSOR: Blythe Masters.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.235
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:50.930
Does anybody know
who Blythe Masters is

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.250
and what she's famous for
beyond Digital Asset Holdings?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.740
AUDIENCE: She worked at
JPMorgan, and she [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.360
credit default swaps.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.310
PROFESSOR: So she
worked at JPMorgan,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.310
and she's known around the
world of credit default swaps.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.900
Gillian Tett, who some of you--

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.590
the Sloan Fellows
will get a chance

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.010
to chat with Gillian Tett
in New York in a few weeks.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.240
Gillian Tett wrote a whole
book about credit default swaps

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.340
and JPMorgan.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.080
And Blythe Masters is
a central character

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.770
in that whole narrative art.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.600
And this is what
she's doing now.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.290
She's brilliant, and she's
a very good businesswoman.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.510
I ran the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.480
and had an opportunity
to meet with her a lot

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.300
because she ran the swap dealer
association ISDA at the time,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.513
or was the outside chair
of ISDA, if I recall.

00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:52.930
And then we're going to talk
about the business trade-offs

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.110
as well.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.340
But what do you think some
of the central business

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.470
trade-offs, if I could
get two or three of you

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.870
to help me out on what
are the central business

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:09.560
trade-offs between permissioned
and permissionless blockchains?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.960
Let me see if I can get
somebody other than Pria.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.860
Yes.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.240
Remind me of your first name.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.740
AUDIENCE: Misha.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.370
So permissioned blockchain have
better privacy and protection,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.990
and better scalability.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.528
And no mining [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:27.320
PROFESSOR: Misha, let's
pause for a minute.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.510
So better scalability, better
privacy, and the third point

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.679
you're saying?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.520
AUDIENCE: No mining.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.419
PROFESSOR: No mining.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.200
Or, mining is associated
with this proof of work.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.826
Any other business trade-off?

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:43.909
AUDIENCE: So for
permissioned, you

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.897
have some more flexibility
with governance.

00:08:45.897 --> 00:08:48.605
If you need to make changes, you
don't need to rely [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:51.560
PROFESSOR: So more flexibility
of governance, in essence,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.830
because if you have a club
deal or group deal, maybe

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.140
you can do that
governance changes

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.690
amongst the group instead of
having thousands of people

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.020
participating.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.780
Kelly?

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.030
AUDIENCE: There's also a key
technological differentiator,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.780
which is the coding language
sort of that the inputs can

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.350
be made in.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.355
So with Hyperledger, they
can use the smart contacts

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:20.680
in any variety of them, versus
the alternative, which is

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.552
the domain specific language.

00:09:22.552 --> 00:09:23.260
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.550
So Hyperledger at least
promotes themselves in their own

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.600
write-ups-- because the
reading was really from them--

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.910
that their embedded language
is much more flexible,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.030
and that you can use Java,
you can use Go, and so forth--

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.320
at least they say they can.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.580
I don't know if it's really
as limited in Ethereum.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.390
But they think and they
promote that they're

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.550
more flexible than Ethereum.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.050
So Kelly's right in that, too.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.730
So these were the readings.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.850
And now, so we're
back to basics again.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.470
What is a blockchain?

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.690
I know we've spent four
or five lectures on it,

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.740
but these key components--

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.610
let's start.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.780
Append-only timestamped logs.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.990
Are they both--
by show of hands,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.500
are they in permissionless
blockchains?

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.760
I hope every single
hand goes up.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.900
Are they in permissioned
or closed blockchains?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.860
I'm watching.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.560
I'm not-- I'm just
going to watch.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.060
All right.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.130
Every hand should go up.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.670
So both sets of blockchains
have this concept

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.700
that goes back nearly
30 years to our friend

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.370
Haber, who started the
whole blockchain that's

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.200
in The New York Times.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.300
This whole concept is in
both sets of blockchains.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.069
Brotish?

00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:58.986
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about basically

00:10:58.986 --> 00:11:04.858
kind of [INAUDIBLE] append-only
[INAUDIBLE] of the ledger.

00:11:04.858 --> 00:11:06.400
I think I read in
one of the readings

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.930
that Corda has a
feature where you

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.380
can make some changes to
the history, which is not

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.680
equivalent to a hard fault.
So that will probably

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.870
be one example where
it is not purely

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.805
append-only in a
permission [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:20.680
PROFESSOR: So Brotish
is raising that there's

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.840
certain features
that are promoted

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.380
in one of the private
blockchains, Corda,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.450
that may allow you not to
append-only, but in essence,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.080
delete data, or
replace data, possibly.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.305
And I'm not-- because there's
also, in private blockchains,

00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:46.600
an inability to partition,
and in essence, sh--

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.760
it's kind of a
form of shorting--

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.380
but to partition the data.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.350
I don't know enough about
Corda, whether they literally

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.030
allow you to delete--

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.940
or is it something
in this partitioning?

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.120
But maybe Hugo?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.500
AUDIENCE: I was going to raise
a similar point that if--

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.250
I mean, to my understanding, if
you have a permissioned system

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.595
and there are only a small
number of-- we'll still

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:14.660
call them nodes, then if you
realize you did something

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.750
wrong, or something
needs to be changed,

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.926
can't they all go
in and change that?

00:12:19.926 --> 00:12:21.920
PROFESSOR: So Hugo's
raising the point,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.710
if you're down to,
like, three nodes--

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.180
as I've shared with you all,
the Australian Stock Exchange

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.400
is putting a
permissioned blockchain

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.600
up using Digital Asset Holdings,
which I think is backed by also

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.660
the Hyperledger
Fabric technology.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.030
But if it's just the
Australian Stock Exchange,

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.700
and it's one node,
or three nodes,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.330
couldn't they just
change it on all three?

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.860
And I think, in essence, yes.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.820
I mean, that may not be what
the database structure is,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.740
but I still think
it's potentially yes.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.850
So as you get more
concentration,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.640
you have more chance.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.800
But Brotish, I will try
to research the Corda

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.882
thing more specifically.

00:13:06.882 --> 00:13:09.480
Other thoughts?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.860
So then you create an auditable
database-- some database

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.960
with cryptography.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.840
Hash functions, which half
the class said they understood

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.096
and the other half
was sort of, you

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:29.450
know, a little rough on, all
is in permissioned systems,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.470
using cryptographic
schemes to ensure

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.560
for the validity of the
data and, so to speak,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.710
the immutable
nature of the data.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.760
What's different is
consensus protocols.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.640
In essence, it all goes down,
except for Brotish's point,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.630
maybe, about Corda, as
to who gets the chance

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.490
to add the additional data.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:59.000
Is it a small club deal,
or is it broad, wide open?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.300
Everybody together, roughly?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.200
So back to the
technical features.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.910
Remember, it's a
bunch of cryptography.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.850
Love it or hate it, it
actually allows us all

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.100
to use the internet--
well past, obviously,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.000
the blockchain that we're
discussing in this class.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.720
Network consensus, and
then all the ledgers.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.870
So both permissioned and
permissionless have ledgers,

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.240
have cryptography.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.170
It's that middle bucket that's
different between the two.

00:14:33.732 --> 00:14:35.190
So what were some
of the challenges

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.390
that we talked
about in blockchain?

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.490
We just talked about them
10 minutes ago, which

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.410
is, what's the list again?

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.700
See, this is the easy part.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.210
If you haven't spoken yet, this
is, like, the easy questions.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.200
Oh, I'm hopelessly shameless.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.450
Yes.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.920
Do you want to say your first
name so Toledo takes you

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.530
off the list?

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.310
PROFESSOR: Did you get it?

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.810
No.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.160
Do you want to say it louder?

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.460
Because Thalita [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.986
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:11.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:18.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] issue
about the scalability.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.125
PROFESSOR: Scalability.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:21.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
takes the time

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.195
to create the next
block about [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:25.070
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.470
So scalability and some time.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.420
So efficiency and scalability.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.970
Anything else?

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:31.790
AUDIENCE: Privacy?

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.582
PROFESSOR: Privacy.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.710
So it's basically
the scalability,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:43.140
the privacy are two big things
that permissioned systems

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.580
address.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.870
Interoperability-- basically,
how does this blockchain

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.600
talk to other blockchains,
or how does this blockchain

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.500
talk to other legacy systems?

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.540
Permissioned and
permissionless systems

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.710
both have issues of
interoperability.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.840
However, the smaller
the club deal,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.070
the more likely that a bank or
the Australian Stock Exchange

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.920
might address its
interoperability right within

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.790
the system, whereas if
it's a big open-sourced,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.800
open project--

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.480
so IBM would say, we can even
help you with interoperability.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.450
IBM would say, we can help
you with all four lines.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.060
We can help you with
scalability, efficiency.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.298
We can help you with privacy.

00:16:29.298 --> 00:16:30.840
We can help you with
interoperability

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.500
and governance.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.460
I think it's less clear
they can help with all four,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.390
but they can certainly
help with the first two.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.140
And Alon, you've switched
from using a permissionless

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.750
to a permissioned system--

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.500
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.150
PROFESSOR: --in
your startup, right?

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.390
Which of these four is the
reason why you switched?

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.012
AUDIENCE: So
actually, I switched--

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.220
PROFESSOR: Or something else?

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.262
AUDIENCE: Something else.

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:57.110
So for me, it was a
business use case.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.080
So I was trying--

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.615
my business is selling to banks.

00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:01.990
PROFESSOR: So that's the next
line-- commercial use case.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.310
AUDIENCE: There it is.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.420
PROFESSOR: There's a setup.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.214
So what was the reason
that you switched?

00:17:08.214 --> 00:17:10.589
AUDIENCE: So I was building
on Ethereum, which is public.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:14.579
And I thought that it's unlikely
that, in the near future,

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.170
banks are going
to adopt Ethereum

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.730
as their underlying technology.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.280
And then I learned
about R3 and Corda,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.040
and learned that banks
actually funded that project.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.845
So I switched to where
the banks put their money.

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:28.470
PROFESSOR: So I would
contend that it's

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.300
a bit about interoperability.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.240
You felt your
users would be more

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.470
likely to be able to
work with your system

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.640
if you were using Corda, with
which they were familiar.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.570
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.745
So there's a business reason
and technological reason.

00:17:45.745 --> 00:17:47.370
PROFESSOR: And then,
of course, there's

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.930
the public policy reasons.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.480
And IBM would even
say that they're

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.350
going to score higher
points on the public policy

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.000
if, for no other
reason, that there's

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.470
better privacy and security.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.710
Now, I'm not trying
to shill for IBM.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.800
I'm just saying these would
be their selling points--

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.816
or Corda, or elsewhere.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.810
We talked about
Buterin's trilemma.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.720
But in another way,
many people would

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.760
say decentralization competes
with scalability and security.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.630
If you want scalability
and security,

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.200
you can't have decentralization.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.320
I'm not a big believer
in this trilemma,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.510
even though I've
now raised it twice.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:36.250
But it's often talked about
at blockchain conferences,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.490
and blockchain papers,
and business discussions.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.690
So I've always told you I want
to be a fair representation

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.230
of the debate that's going on.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:52.390
I think it's more possible to
solve these three over time

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.150
together than some others.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.660
But maybe I'm just a cockeyed
optimist about technology.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.300
So public policy framework.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.800
What were the big
three slipstreams?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.670
So I went fast last time--

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.530
last class.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.846
Leonardo, what are you
going to tell me about the--

00:19:11.846 --> 00:19:14.090
it's because you were
adjusting your glasses.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.400
No, we spoke about
the difficulty

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.810
to implement framework.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.430
And you were talking more
about the need [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.617
offer security to
protect people.

00:19:29.617 --> 00:19:31.200
PROFESSOR: To protect
people-- so it's

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.670
sort of a privacy thing.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.860
I think I have a hand
up here from Catalina.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.260
AUDIENCE: There are three big
things that [INAUDIBLE] public

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.090
policy working against
illicit activity--

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.030
PROFESSOR: Illicit activity.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.360
AUDIENCE: --financial
instability, and protecting

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.751
the investors.

00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:53.751
PROFESSOR: There you go.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.700
All right.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.960
So you know my style.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.390
I try to drop things
into three buckets.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.810
But it's the only way I
can remember anything.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.920
But it is the three
big buckets, of course.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.028
And since I went
fast last time--

00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:13.070
and we're going to be
coming back to a lot of it,

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.047
but were there any
questions that you have?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.380
And this is just an opportunity.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.348
Brotish?

00:20:17.348 --> 00:20:19.390
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.320
stability point.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.600
Like, you mentioned that
because of the world

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.800
value of the digital currency
is very minimal compared to,

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.500
let's say, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.700
PROFESSOR: The value
of crypto finance

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.750
is about $220 billion right now,
compared to worldwide capital

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.215
markets that, in aggregate,
are over $300 trillion

00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:46.780
of debt, bonds, and equities.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.410
AUDIENCE: So my question was
more like [INAUDIBLE] opinion

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.880
on this, that this value is also
concentrated within a limited

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.970
number of people compared to
the other assets that we are

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.490
talking about, and hence--

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.610
I mean, it can still be
important to regularize

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.455
on the financial
stability side, because it

00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:08.520
can have a effect which is not
in proportion to just the size.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.920
PROFESSOR: So Brotish is
asking the question that even

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.460
though it's only $200
billion versus $300

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:19.900
plus trillion of worldwide
financial assets,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.860
couldn't it still be relevant
to financial stability?

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.360
And the answer is yes.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.830
But it's still relatively-- it's
less than one one-thousandths

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.960
of the broad size.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.520
PROFESSOR: Yes, please.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.560
Better you than me.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.100
AUDIENCE: So basically,
we did an analysis between

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.200
the correlation [INAUDIBLE]
public market [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.320
and basically there's a
correlation of roughly 80%

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.160
to 85% when the public--

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.820
when the Bitcoin market's
down, within the past year,

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.620
the public market's
likely to lift up.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.150
Because there's a lot of
leverage built into the system.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.070
And once the
volatility kicks in,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.410
a lot of the
investors [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.590
they have to get money out
from the public market,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.990
and that kind of
feeds into a loop.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.990
PROFESSOR: So you're
saying there's correlation,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.540
and there may be feedback loops.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.308
Tom?

00:22:16.308 --> 00:22:17.850
AUDIENCE: Sort of
a related question.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.940
So Mervyn King was in this
room a couple hours ago,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.430
and he was talking
about, in the '08 crisis,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:27.270
two issues of trust-- one where
there was a counterparty trust

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.650
issue.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.750
Even though the overall
derivatives market

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.230
was [INAUDIBLE],, banks
didn't individually

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.640
know which other bank
was most at risk.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.120
And so they wouldn't
trade with each other

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.590
or lend to one another.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.680
And then on the opposite
side, the solution--

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.040
the salvation-- was two
people in a room trusting

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.290
each other that the central
bank-- that the government

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:53.100
would fund tens of billions of
dollars [INAUDIBLE] capital.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.170
And so I wonder your
thoughts on blockchain's role

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.690
in addressing that
first problem of knowing

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.190
your counterparty,
or at least being

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.880
able to trust their
position, and then the risk

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.780
of eliminating the second
chance of injection of capital

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.730
into the financial
system in a blockchain.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.938
PROFESSOR: Russ, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:14.938 --> 00:23:16.063
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.010
It's related to this--

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.100
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.175
AUDIENCE: --which is--

00:23:18.175 --> 00:23:19.300
PROFESSOR: Thanks, Brotish.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.650
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.910
AUDIENCE: But the
question is this.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.410
It does strike me that you
only have a financial stability

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:32.400
problem if people are relying
on the value of people's

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.310
Bitcoin holdings, for example,
which is the bulk of crypto

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.230
assets, right?

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.480
The reason you have the
problem during the crisis

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.472
is you have all these banks.

00:23:41.472 --> 00:23:43.680
They're carrying these assets
on their balance sheet.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.138
And all of the
sudden, people think

00:23:45.138 --> 00:23:47.910
they don't know what
they're worth, right?

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.750
Who, if anyone, is actually
carrying a Bitcoin assets

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.607
on a balance sheet that
someone else is relying on?

00:23:54.607 --> 00:23:56.940
Or, to put it differently,
who's extending the leverage?

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.370
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.060
So let me--

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.950
PROFESSOR: Let me
wrap these together.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.640
I think that what many central
bankers and the Financial

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.190
Stability Board would
say, at 200 billion

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:14.170
versus 300 trillion, it's
probably not that financially

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.540
relevant at this point.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.310
Where it could get relevant is,
as Russ has sort of suggested,

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.410
is if there's
leverage behind it.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.975
If it's in a balance sheet, it's
an asset on a balance sheet,

00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:28.810
and there's a liability
on the other side.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.880
And thus it could
bring down that entity,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.950
whether it's a hedge
fund, whether it's a bank.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.090
But something that's relying
[INAUDIBLE] to tie it

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.020
back to the questions
that Tom raised

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.760
is, could blockchain
lower systemic risk?

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.320
Possibly, if it's a
better database solution.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.590
If it answers-- what Mervyn
King was speaking about,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.000
we also addressed
in the late 90s.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.680
I remember quite well
when Secretary Rubin

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.640
called a number of us
into his office and said,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.560
I don't understand.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.562
The banks can't tell us
their exposure to Korea.

00:25:08.562 --> 00:25:09.520
A number of countries--

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.610
South Korea was about
to have-- but they

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.230
didn't default on
their debt, but they

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.200
were coming close to
defaulting on their debt.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.480
And of course, it was
only a short while

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.210
before other countries,
like Indonesia and Thailand,

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:27.310
were getting into that
same debt challenge.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.080
But why couldn't banks tell
the US Department of Treasury

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.705
their exposure?

00:25:31.705 --> 00:25:35.080
It's usually
through derivatives.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.640
And derivatives,
both in the late '90s

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.230
and the financial
crisis, were often

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.340
something that propagated
risk through the system.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.590
Now, the numbers were larger--

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.510
I mean, depending upon the time.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.280
The '90s was less than this.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.910
But it was $300, $400
trillion of notional amount

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.390
of derivatives.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.040
So just the sheer
notional size, even

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.900
though the capital at
risk in derivatives

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.670
was much smaller
because the leverage

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.220
of this notional--
big, notional size.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.980
And the transparency
was pretty low.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.180
It wasn't zero, actually.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.560
It wasn't zero.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.180
But it was really low.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.490
And so I think that's
what Mervyn King would

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.540
have been mentioning.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.800
And I do think blockchain can
help in that transparency.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.720
But it takes a big
collective action.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.990
And so Europe, the US,
and Asia-- a lot of laws

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.930
were passed to get more
transparency in the derivatives

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.370
space.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.220
Brotish, I would say that
there could be problems.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.640
And I've had conversations
with elected leaders that

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.460
say, don't get
lulled into the sense

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.100
that it won't have
financial stability issues.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.830
Because that was what
happened in the 1980s and '90s

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.940
when people said, well,
derivatives will not

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:01.210
create instability,
because it's only

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:05.080
the institutional investors,
the sophisticated investors--

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.030
the so to speak big boys
or big girls, you know?

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:16.990
And I was part of those debates,
that consensus that formed that

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.690
it was only institutional
and it wouldn't--

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.170
but there was a lot of leverage
and a lack of transparency when

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.490
big leverage--

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.890
multiple hundreds of
trillions of dollars--

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.060
associated with it, of course,
was part of the crisis--

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.500
not the only part of the crisis.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.430
But any other
questions before Hugo?

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.752
On the protecting the
investing public front,

00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:42.310
I was just wondering,
like, a lot of people

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.940
are now using Robinhood and
zero fee things like that

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.130
to invest in the stock market.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.400
And companies like
Robinhood and Vanguard

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.420
often sell order book data
to high frequency traders

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.880
so that they can kind
of know what's going on

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.250
and maybe front run.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:05.320
So I was wondering how
that fits into what

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.000
we were talking
about last time where

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.440
there's no transparency on
many of the cryptocurrency

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.400
exchanges.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.380
And then in addition to that,
big institutional investors

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.690
can, I think, buy upwards
of 5% of any stock

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:28.100
and then wait a few days before
they have to report on that.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.540
So that can also have a
huge effect on stock price.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.380
And then they can,
afterwards, dump on people.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.830
So how is that different
from what's going on

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.120
in cryptocurrency exchanges?

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.390
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.980
So that's an investor
protection one.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.630
Was there another one in the--

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.040
is this investor
protection, or--

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.790
AUDIENCE: No, it's a
little bit different.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:47.880
PROFESSOR: A little different.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.210
All right.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.350
Any other investor protection?

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.610
Because I'm going to collect
them and then [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.170
AUDIENCE: It's about the former.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.460
I was a little bit--

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.120
it was kind of [INAUDIBLE] to me
when you say the blockchain can

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.100
help to stabilize the
financial markets--

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:00.210
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.540
So that's back to
financial stability.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.460
If it can--

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.335
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:29:03.335 --> 00:29:03.990
Can I hold it?

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.300
Let me just answer Hugo's
investor protection one.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:13.010
So all markets-- not
just crypto markets--

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.810
all markets are susceptible to
some forms of front running.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.380
In essence, if you have
a client relationship

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.470
and you get information
from your client that

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:28.100
might affect the
market pricing, you

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.480
might jump ahead of that
client with their information.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.200
Their information might be
a buy order, a sell order.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.850
Or frankly, it might be
some other information.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.170
But traditionally, if they have
a buy order or a sell order,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.790
you have information.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:49.300
And then you're sort of jumping
ahead and saying, all right.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.190
I'll buy or sell
in front of them.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.710
That's the classic
sort of front running,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.550
even though there's
other methods.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.050
It's not supposed to happen.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:04.870
On regulated exchanges, you
have some policing of it.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.640
Even before
governments stood in,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.110
you could have
some policing of it

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.590
in self-regulatory
organizations.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:16.600
In the crypto world, there
is Katy bar the door.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.670
Anything can really happen.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.820
And it's my belief
and understanding

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.940
that many crypto
exchanges-- not all of them.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.670
Not all of them.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.940
But many crypto
exchanges are basically

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.200
trading in front
of their customers.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.590
And in fact, most
crypto exchanges

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.190
make markets, as they
are both market makers--

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.430
meaning they are buying when
you're selling and selling

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.390
when you're buying.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.300
That's the nature
of a market maker.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.490
It's very typical, very
legal, very important

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.750
function of market.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.720
But the exchanges are
both market makers,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.790
and then they show order books.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:31:00.120
And so it sort of helps
them do front running.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.030
Not that a lot of people
necessarily agree with me,

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.250
I think these markets
would be better off

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.850
if there were some forms of
rules about front running

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.070
and manipulation in
markets and the like.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.320
On your 5% question,
can we take it up

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.760
in office hours or something?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.650
Because it's sort of
outside of crypto.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.320
But I would be glad to
talk about the SEC rules

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.168
about the 5%.

00:31:21.168 --> 00:31:22.335
Is this investor protection?

00:31:22.335 --> 00:31:23.270
And that--

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.210
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.390
The reading that we had
that talked about the Fabric

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.010
technology, it
mentioned something

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.950
about execute order validate.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.740
Does that mechanism
tie into the way

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.750
that front running
would work at all?

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.650
PROFESSOR: All
blockchain technology,

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.810
whether it's permissioned,
like Fabric, or permissionless,

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.690
can--

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.280
if it was efficient
and scalable--

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.480
could help out, because you
could actually timestamp

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.340
when did the order come in.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.310
When did the
client's information

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.180
get to the exchange, and is
somebody standing in front?

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.910
AUDIENCE: So it's
sort of like a cascade

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.450
that you can't necessarily
pause once it starts?

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:06.450
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:10.470
So if you look at the algorithms
at the New York Stock Exchange

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.382
right now, which
are not blockchain--

00:32:13.382 --> 00:32:15.090
they're not permissioned,
and they're not

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.390
permissionless blockchain.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.740
But if you look at both the
algorithms and the data flows,

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.023
they have very
good timestamping.

00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:23.440
I'm not going to
say it's perfect,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.940
but they have very
good timestamping

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.440
to ensure when are orders--

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.630
basically message timestamping
every message that comes in.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.300
And some order books, like
the New York Stock Exchange--

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.280
some order books are
price and time priority,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.960
price priority meaning high bid
gets hit before the next bid,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.800
or lowest offer
gets lifted first.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.720
That's price priority.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.670
But they might also
have time priority

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:57.570
for any bid that has the same
price and any offer that's

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.040
the same price.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.140
So they have to have
very good timestamping.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.040
I truly believe you could
not use a blockchain

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.540
solution for the New York Stock
Exchange order book right now.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.020
Whether you can in 10
years, I'm not sure.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.740
But time latency is so relevant
in the middle of those order

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.830
books--

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.860
you know, the
nanoseconds that matter.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.715
I'm going to take this
stability question.

00:33:24.715 --> 00:33:26.280
There were two
stability-- and then

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.610
we're going to move on to
the rest of today's lecture.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.760
You're having fun now.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.580
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain a little bit more

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.060
about, like, well,
say if blockchain

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.630
can be a better
database so it can help

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.340
stabilize the financial market?

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.110
Can you give some examples?

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.750
PROFESSOR: So how
blockchain could possibly

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.030
help-- be a stabilizer.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.840
A lot of financial instability--

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.640
or, beyond the
financial markets,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.970
instability is a
question of resilience.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.550
And when things are
centralized, you

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:04.490
create single points of
failure in any system--

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.020
really, in military
or financial.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.940
You centralize something,
you then, thus--

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.830
you know what to attack.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.860
You can also maybe have
higher walls or better moats,

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.199
but you still know of
something to attack.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.080
So blockchain, in its
decentralized nature,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.409
might be a more
resilient database,

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.239
because even if half or
two thirds of it goes down,

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:30.580
you still have the other third.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.080
I'm going to say something about
the New York Stock Exchange

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.969
again.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.920
Whether it's the New York Stock
Exchange, the London Stock

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.670
Exchange, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:43.449
they all are required by
their various local laws

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:47.449
to have backup data centers.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:52.380
And those backup data centers
even have to be lots of miles

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.936
away if, God forbid, a bomb
comes and takes out the center.

00:34:57.936 --> 00:34:59.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.210
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.830
It's called-- Its basically
disaster recovery.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.550
So maybe blockchain
will be more resilient.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.050
I'm going to take
two more questions

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.425
and then get back
to permissioned

00:35:08.425 --> 00:35:09.900
versus permissionless.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.195
Way back in the corner--
your first name, again, is?

00:35:12.195 --> 00:35:12.820
AUDIENCE: Matt.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.290
PROFESSOR: Matt.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.010
Thank you, Matt.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.585
I should know that.

00:35:15.585 --> 00:35:17.790
AUDIENCE: So I'm kind
of just curious how,

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.175
essentially, the nasency,
for lack of a better word--

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:21.300
PROFESSOR: The [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.920
AUDIENCE: Like, the nasency--

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.680
how kind of, like,
new this market

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.700
is and how that affects policy,
because when you're shaping

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.340
policy, and you
don't necessarily

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.150
have a bunch of years of
knowing how people are going

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.078
to react to that policy, I
feel like it could almost

00:35:38.078 --> 00:35:39.370
be a chicken and egg situation.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.920
PROFESSOR: OK, I understand.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.020
Anybody else with
the same theme?

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:43.710
No?

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:47.820
So the question is, how
does it affect policy makers

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.880
when a whole technology is new?

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.510
And I would say, we have a
lot of history with this.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.080
Whether it was railroads,
or the telegraph,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.665
or the telephone, or television,
we have a lot of history.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.150
Technology and
commercial applications

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:11.600
move ahead of the public sector.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.560
I mean, it's just inevitable.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.720
The official sector,
the public sector--

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.420
unless it just basically
does what Mark Carney says,

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.720
and the choice is to isolate
something, to sort of put up

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.580
the moats of a
society and says, we

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.220
can't use that technology here.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.570
Unless you have that, technology
usually supersedes the markets,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.080
and the markets and technology
come before official sector.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.990
Depending upon the
area, it can take

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.710
single digit years and sometimes
decades for public sector

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.280
to catch up, literally.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.220
But let's take the internet.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.340
The internet was being
worked on for 15ish years.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.030
But the protocol layer
that helped take off

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.290
was the worldwide web
in 1991 or '92, and then

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.210
the security protocols in '96.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.880
Just taking
financial regulation,

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:16.075
the SEC was asked in 1995,
could bulletin boards--

00:37:16.075 --> 00:37:18.540
there were electronic
bulletin boards

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.850
listing stocks and bonds--

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:25.890
be exempted from being
considered stock exchanges?

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.950
Well, the people
that were asking that

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.930
were the people putting
up the bulletin boards.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.280
They didn't want
to be regulated.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.670
The New York Stock Exchange
that was fully regulated,

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.500
and NASDAQ that was
fully regulated,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.180
was coming at the
other side and asking

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.640
the SEC to shut them down.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.610
They didn't want the
competition from the disruptors.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:49.480
It took three years for the
SEC to answer that question.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.680
I don't mean answer it,
like, with a letter.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.870
They had to propose a rule, and
they had to do a final rule,

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.840
and it was three
years to do that.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:04.310
And blockchain, I think,
we are through some

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.050
of the big questions.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.005
We know how most
jurisdictions tax--

00:38:09.005 --> 00:38:12.770
T-A-X-- tax it as property
and not as currency,

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.660
and some of the tax issues.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.150
We know, in most
jurisdictions, how

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.970
it fits into,
broadly, Bank Secrecy

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.440
Act and illicit activity.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.570
There's very choppy
implementation,

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.520
very spotty implementation.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.160
I would say the investor
protection side,

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.720
we're at the early stages.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.330
And it's going to take, in most
jurisdictions, another three

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:38.570
years, maybe, to sort
through some of how--

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.308
and this is just crypto finance.

00:38:40.308 --> 00:38:40.850
I don't know.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.530
Matt, does that--

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.470
I'm giving you some predictions.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.230
Some of it could be
multiple decades.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.160
We're still, today,
trying to figure out--

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.670
the public sector's figuring
out how to regulate Facebook

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.210
and Google.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.730
I'm going to take one last
question, because I've

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.720
got to do permissioned.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because I was kind of, like--

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.300
it kind of answers the side
following the technology.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.840
But I think, for
me, what I was kind

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.950
of wondering about was this, the
way we're like-- as soon as you

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.770
apply regulations to something
that at least a good portion

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.160
of the market seems to
value being deregulated,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.620
it seems like a lot of
the activity will change,

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.780
either in scope or scale.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.730
PROFESSOR: So Matt's
raising there's

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.980
a trade-off about
bringing something

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:27.850
under regulation or into
the public policy sphere.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.410
I'm probably just
one voice of this,

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.570
but I think it's probably true.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.970
There's very few
economic activities

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:38.860
that grow large that stay fully
outside of the public policy

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.560
framework of a society.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.230
It doesn't mean that public
policy frameworks don't change,

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.420
get adopted, get adapted.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.430
The internet comes
along, and at first, it's

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.650
a question of-- you
know, with Amazon,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.450
is it going to be taxed or not?

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.830
Is there sales tax?

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.290
And then later-- you
know, at first, it's not.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.570
Later, it is.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.490
And in some jurisdictions,
questions on the internet

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.760
was liability.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.040
And this was a very critical
question of early internet was,

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.370
was there liability for
any of the information

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.610
or the flow of information?

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.180
I'm talking about libel laws
and all the liability issues

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.800
and so forth.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.700
And so in the US, there's a
section of the law in 1996

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.350
was passed.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.810
And now we're coming back
and saying, wait a minute.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:29.560
That gave too broad-- it
basically exempted the internet

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.530
from liability as carriers.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.073
But now, that was
modified in 2018--

00:40:36.073 --> 00:40:40.100
22 years later-- to say, well,
if it has to do, I think,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.080
with basically children
trafficking and slavery

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.860
and everything, maybe we should
tighten that up a little bit.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:57.000
So I don't believe any
broad economic activity

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.155
is going to remain fully outside
public policy frameworks.

00:41:04.155 --> 00:41:08.160
And I'm glad to be
challenged on that.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.085
And I think blockchain, and
particularly crypto finance,

00:41:11.085 --> 00:41:13.740
is at this grappling
stage to get in.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.240
So let me move
forward, because this

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.160
is more about permissioned
and permissionless.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.410
I just wanted to
cover some of these.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.470
We will cover initial coin
offerings and the public policy

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.990
issues around initial coin
offerings in the Howey Test.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:26.780
We will cover crypto
exchanges, and we

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.210
will cover central bank
digital currencies a lot

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.710
in the second half
of this semester.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.810
So back to the trade-offs
that we talked about already--

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:41.960
the trade-offs of centralization
and decentralizations

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.430
and Coase's work from
the 1930s about the firm.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.960
This is the cost, remember.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.830
This is the cost.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.160
As we get centralized, there's
more cost of economic rents,

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.600
single points of
failure, and capture.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.780
Some fragility, in a
sense, in the system.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.990
But decentralization
has its cost as well.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.340
You'll notice that these two
lines are crossing somewhere.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.850
It was my failed attempt
to say, you know,

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.260
maybe there's a balance.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.130
Maybe overall, while
some organizations

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.530
will find all the way
to decentralization,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.780
and some to
centralization, I think

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.350
economic systems tend more
towards the centralized side

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.090
of things.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.310
But you can change the slope
of these two lines if you want.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:36.240
I'm just trying to give you a
framework of thinking about it.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.390
So as we've talked about,
the financial sector

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.840
pretty much favors
permissioned systems.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.590
The financial sector is
saying, going back, no.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:52.170
Too many costs of coordination,
governance, security, privacy,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.262
and scalability.

00:42:54.262 --> 00:42:55.470
We're over in the other side.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.390
And so that's where
they are today.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.040
I'm not sure that's where
they'll be in five or 10 years,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.870
but it is definitely
where they are today.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.983
So let's go back down
our list, in a sense.

00:43:13.983 --> 00:43:15.650
I'm going to have a
bunch of check marks

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:16.840
and x's on the right.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.580
Where do you think I'm going
to have check marks and x's?

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.600
This is the same
three big buckets,

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.040
because I can't
think of anything.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.823
Emily, do you have
a point of view?

00:43:27.823 --> 00:43:29.240
AUDIENCE: I mean,
I think in terms

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.480
of the permissioned technical
features, one of them

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.213
is obviously that it's not
using that proof of work.

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.130
PROFESSOR: Not using--

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.540
AUDIENCE: It's not using
the same proof of work.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.998
PROFESSOR: Not
using proof of work.

00:43:39.998 --> 00:43:45.040
So I had to give away-- you
know, reveal the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.430
All the cryptography that's
used in permissionless systems

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.310
is used in the
permissioned systems.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.430
It might be used a
little differently.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:59.080
I'm not going to say the Merkle
trees are exactly the same.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.880
But all that broccoli we were
eating a few lectures ago

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.465
are relevant on both sides.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.415
Sorry, Alin.

00:44:09.415 --> 00:44:10.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:10.860
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.090
You--

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:11.796
AUDIENCE: I like broccoli.

00:44:11.796 --> 00:44:13.004
PROFESSOR: You like broccoli.

00:44:13.004 --> 00:44:15.630
A computer scientist speaking.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.300
Everything, though, about
digital signatures and hash

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:22.480
functions and so forth are
relevant to both of these.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.870
But they're not
necessarily relevant

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.600
to every traditional
database, which we'll

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.320
talk about in 10 minutes or so.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.460
But as Emily said,
there's really not--

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.150
I said, no.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:38.180
There's not decentralized
network consensus.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.150
I'm stretching it a little bit,
because permissioned systems

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.600
can be decentralized.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.930
There could be five
or 10 or 20 nodes.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.730
And so that is decentralized.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.160
So I shouldn't have
really said no.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.560
I should have said
maybe, or hybrid.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.250
And instead of proof of work,
the permissioned systems

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.160
use a bunch of
consensus mechanisms.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.290
And I just listed
a couple notary

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:13.700
nodes or PBFT for Byzantine
Fault Tolerance again.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.380
But they don't have
native currencies.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.060
So that is a very
big difference--

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.560
no native currency.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.860
If you have a solution
for your final projects,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.878
or you have a solution for
some entrepreneurial business

00:45:27.878 --> 00:45:29.420
that you're going
to do in the future

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.420
that you want a native currency,
you're probably more over

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.777
into the permissionless world.

00:45:35.777 --> 00:45:37.860
You want to have an incentive
structure, something

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:43.080
to motivate customers or users,
or create token economics.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.290
Token economics is more
in the permissionless.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.460
I say more because you
can create a token even

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.680
in the permissioned space.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.670
We'll talk about it in a moment.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.880
And then transaction
script or UTXOs.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.700
They're not technically
UTXOs in a bunch

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.180
of permissioned systems,
but you need some ledger.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.540
This last box, if I
just called it ledgers,

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.360
you'd still have ledgers in.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.570
So it's really the consensus
mechanism in the middle,

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.610
as Emily said.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.030
A couple of key design features.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.900
First, membership's limited
to basically an authorized set

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.552
of nodes.

00:46:27.552 --> 00:46:31.640
So does anybody want to
say, if you were a bank,

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.150
who you might-- you know,
what might you do if you were

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.940
a bank, and who might you
authorize if you're doing

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.560
a bank--

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.410
I don't know.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:46.030
Let's say that it
was loans, or if it's

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.640
Mark Snyderman's real estate.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.340
It's real estate loans.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.930
Could you ever see
real estate loans

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:55.672
going on a blockchain, Mark?

00:46:55.672 --> 00:46:56.880
MARK SNYDERMAN: Loans, maybe.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.900
Loans could.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.140
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.650
So--

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.463
MARK SNYDERMAN: Loans
aren't traded as much.

00:47:01.463 --> 00:47:02.880
PROFESSOR: So if
real estate loans

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.080
were on a permissioned
blockchain,

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.870
who might be that
membership, the limited--

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:14.040
who would-- it's not just
a rhetorical question.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.742
Who would actually care about
the database of the loans?

00:47:17.742 --> 00:47:19.200
MARK SNYDERMAN:
Broker dealers that

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.280
are active in loans,
institutional investors that

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.380
are active in loans.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.230
PROFESSOR: So the
broker dealers who

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:31.563
are actually trading the
loans, and maybe the investors.

00:47:31.563 --> 00:47:32.075
Alon?

00:47:32.075 --> 00:47:32.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.338
Just rating agencies when
you securitize those loans--

00:47:36.338 --> 00:47:37.380
AUDIENCE: Loan servicers.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:37.760
AUDIENCE: Loan servicers.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.440
PROFESSOR: Amanda,
loan servicers.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.620
So maybe loan servicers,
maybe the rating agencies.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:47.870
So it's basically, who has
a need and needs that data?

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.450
I'm not sure that this
is the right community,

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.670
but it's the discussion
I'm thinking about.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.425
And again, as you're
thinking about--

00:47:54.425 --> 00:47:57.290
I'm jumping again to a little
bit final projects, but when

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:01.700
you're thinking about
who actually needs data

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.140
and who has a reason
to amend the data,

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.060
or write to the ledger--

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.980
because if you don't
have a desire and a need

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:18.300
to actually amend or change the
data, move value in the system,

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:22.190
you might not need
an open database.

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.690
Please.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.190
AUDIENCE: When we
were talking about

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.910
that additional layer of
blocks, is that layer also--

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:33.152
can you change the
membership with that layer?

00:48:33.152 --> 00:48:35.110
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure
I follow your question.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.726
When you say an additional
layer of blocks--

00:48:37.726 --> 00:48:39.670
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:40.860
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:41.505
Layer 2.

00:48:41.505 --> 00:48:42.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.220
Can you alter the--

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.750
because it's a different level
of refinement of information

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.310
that's stored.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.940
PROFESSOR: So what
Kelly is asking is,

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.270
we've talked about how
to make permissionless

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.240
blockchains more scalable
by having a layer

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.400
2, like the Lightning Network.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.800
That's what you're referencing.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.430
So in permissionless systems,
it's open to everyone,

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.860
even though if you're opening
up an individual payment

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.730
channel in the
Lightning Network,

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.550
it's really just
two counterparties

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.680
opening up a channel.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.620
So in a sense, you've
already narrowed the scope,

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.390
because you might
just have a payment

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.790
channel between two parties--

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.460
some side chains or
multiple parties.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.650
Lightning Network
and payment channels

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.627
tend to be two parties.

00:49:34.627 --> 00:49:35.460
So I don't know if--

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.660
was that what you're asking?

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.610
AUDIENCE: That network
in and of itself

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:42.308
is a mechanism of membership.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.940
PROFESSOR: The layer
2 can be a membership.

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.200
That is correct.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.800
But it's a technology that's
available to everybody.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:58.010
So it has attributes where you
can open up bilateral channels.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.510
James.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:59.050
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to say,

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.800
for permissioned
blockchains, couldn't you

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.330
imagine that the layer
1 would be, say, the Fed

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.125
with all of the big
commercial banks?

00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:08.500
But in effect, if
you're thinking

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.917
about a different
layer, you could

00:50:09.917 --> 00:50:12.180
have another layer
on top of that, which

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.310
[INAUDIBLE] central banks.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:13.890
So you could naturally--

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.280
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.072
AUDIENCE: --have two
layers of deals with--

00:50:16.072 --> 00:50:17.770
PROFESSOR: So where
we're headed is,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.970
is do permissioned
systems have the same need

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:26.080
to have a second layer
as permissionless?

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.000
And even if they don't
have the same needs,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.550
might it actually
provide something?

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.220
So I would say, I don't
think they have the same need

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.460
to have a second layer,
because they're more scalable,

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.430
they're more
efficient right now.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.230
And they're already
closed clubs.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:46.260
But even if they don't
have the same need,

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.230
they might actually want to
put a second layer on top.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:53.350
And some of them actually do
this right in their technology.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.510
And it's what I put up here
as the second and third bullet

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.390
point.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:01.620
The transactions can be
limited to only authorized

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.240
known participants.

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:08.932
So in many permissioned systems,
it's a one broad technology.

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:14.450
It might only be 20 people that
can authorize transactions.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.380
But now in some transactions,
it will only be Anton and May.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.940
And in other transactions,
it will be Alpha and Amanda.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.550
So I might not be able to--

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.590
by the way, Alpha
might be Goldman Sachs,

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.110
and Amanda might be Barclays.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:32.150
And then it might
make more sense.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:35.230
And Mark might be Fidelity.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.530
And I don't know, am I the
US Department of Treasury

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:39.030
in this one?

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.780
Mark and I both
started out in finance.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.740
I just went off to
public service later.

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:54.830
But so Corda and Hyperledger and
many of the private blockchains

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:59.210
literally allow for partitioning
right in the blockchain.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.980
I don't know if you'd
need to put a layer

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.630
2 on top, because they allow
for partitioning and segregated

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:09.060
pools of authority
inside of the blockchain.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:09.560
I'm sorry?

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.120
There was a question, I thought.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.374
Oh.

00:52:12.374 --> 00:52:13.210
Oh, yeah.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
see insurance companies,

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.773
like title insurance,
as part of this.

00:52:17.773 --> 00:52:18.940
PROFESSOR: Can you speak up?

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.457
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:19.457 --> 00:52:21.790
AUDIENCE: Insurance companies
for title for the houses--

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:22.670
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.010
AUDIENCE: --I think blockchain
could be really helpful,

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.250
because sometimes you have
the trust issue around who

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.160
owned the house before
you, or the title where

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.420
it goes backwards in history.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:37.700
So I think title
insurance companies

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.220
would be part of this blockchain
in terms of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.910
PROFESSOR: So your point is,
is that titling of real estate

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:49.065
could be an important part of
blockchains, and as [AUDIO OUT]

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:50.440
MARK SNYDERMAN:
Probably someday,

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.850
but every little town has its
own system for keeping property

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.200
records.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.850
And getting them all to
cooperate in a blockchain

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:05.233
kind of solution seems remote.

00:53:05.233 --> 00:53:07.150
They don't think they
have a real problem that

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.990
needs solving.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:10.640
So yeah, maybe someday.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.540
But I doubt it will
happen anytime soon.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.240
But it makes some logical sense.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.460
And that would probably be
a permissionless system,

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.880
because there's not a huge
amount of times a piece

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:27.480
of property transacts, right?

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.260
So it's not like moving
money around the world.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.063
It's a much simpler,
less frequent event.

00:53:35.063 --> 00:53:35.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah--

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.010
MARK SNYDERMAN: And
land records are public.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:42.710
People often have to go to the
town offices to look at them.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have to
pay a lot of transaction fees,

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:49.595
whether you're transacting on a
plant or anything that involves

00:53:49.595 --> 00:53:51.660
real estate here in the US.

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.420
You have to pay
considerable amount of fees

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.910
to the title
insurance companies.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.550
And in my mind, that
could eliminate that role

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:05.720
if you have blockchain and
[INAUDIBLE] where the system.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.580
MARK SNYDERMAN: Maybe,
but you're paying money

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.742
because you're asking--

00:54:10.742 --> 00:54:11.700
AUDIENCE: Somebody to--

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.820
MARK SNYDERMAN:
--them and lawyers

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.665
to make sure the
title's free and clear.

00:54:16.665 --> 00:54:17.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.967
MARK SNYDERMAN: And there's
all sorts of claims on a title

00:54:19.967 --> 00:54:20.580
to property--

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.900
somebody that fixed the
roof, or the utility company

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:28.050
that has an easement through
the middle to put lines

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:30.280
and so forth.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.450
So there are some
complications that

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:37.090
are different than just
transferring money.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:42.572
PROFESSOR: So to bring it
back, to broaden it out,

00:54:42.572 --> 00:54:44.060
the que-- it's Rahim?

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:44.927
AUDIENCE: Rahem.

00:54:44.927 --> 00:54:45.635
PROFESSOR: Rahem.

00:54:45.635 --> 00:54:47.760
Rahem's question
is, is, well, what

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.680
about real estate and title?

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.880
Might that be appropriate?

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.350
And as Mark has given us a
sense of, yes, it might be.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:58.620
But we're back to that sort of
thing of the collective action

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.680
issues that we've talked
about in previous classes--

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:07.140
the collective action of
many municipal authorities

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.485
that keep the land records, that
keep the real estate records.

00:55:10.485 --> 00:55:15.120
Yeah, it might help, but
why do I need to do this?

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.320
And it's also a [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.740
It's a low volume,
low transaction.

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.350
And yet, it could be
an enormous benefit,

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.630
because there's something
called title insurance.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.090
And title insurance trying
to clean up the title

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:32.030
and making sure that
something is free and clear

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.520
could be recorded in the future.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.620
So I'll be a long-term optimist.

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.410
I don't see this one being
solved in the next handful

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.480
of years-- single digit years--

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.000
particularly because of the
[INAUDIBLE] collective action

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.940
issues.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:46.440
I'm sorry.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.815
We have somebody
here who's going

00:55:47.815 --> 00:55:52.990
to take the other side before I
give my conclusionary estimate.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.490
Yes?

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:54.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:55.113
That's exactly my startup.

00:55:55.113 --> 00:55:59.055
The first phase is
collecting all the data

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:02.583
from all those munis
departmentals [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:02.583 --> 00:56:04.000
The information
is there publicly.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.820
So yes, they will not probably
immediately adopt a Corda node

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.050
and record their stuff.

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.860
But you can publicly
pool that information

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.650
and then use that information
and record that information

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:17.770
on the blockchain.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:21.720
And then once I become
stronger and bigger,

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.815
then they will probably
have to adopt it.

00:56:23.815 --> 00:56:24.690
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:25.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.900
So maybe I'll move
up my estimate

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.660
from double digit years
to single digit years.

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:35.527
But I think it's going to be,
with all respect, some time.

00:56:35.527 --> 00:56:36.860
Pria, then I'm going to move on.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.200
AUDIENCE: So I used
to work at Habitat

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.530
for Humanity International.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:43.190
So access to proper
land rights or land

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.590
title, that was a big
issue for us overseas,

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.480
not so much in the US.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.400
And so I could see a
real application there,

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.430
where in several countries
where there is no land record,

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:55.370
or there are no title
systems, or they're buried

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.630
in layers of obfuscation.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:59.990
This is a great solution
to get something

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:05.000
like that started in those
contexts, where there is--

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.330
establishing the
property right of record

00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:10.563
could be of immeasurable
social value.

00:57:10.563 --> 00:57:12.350
PROFESSOR: You
know, I agree, and I

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:15.080
think there's been a
tremendous amount of literature

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.840
in the last 24 months
around whether blockchain

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:25.100
can help free up a lot of
illiquid capital and assets.

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:30.350
I'm just saying I'm probably
closer to Mark's thinking

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:31.928
than to Alon's thinking.

00:57:31.928 --> 00:57:33.470
I think it's going
to take some time.

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.330
AUDIENCE: But depending
on the context, right?

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:35.997
In the context--

00:57:35.997 --> 00:57:40.580
PROFESSOR: Context, the country,
the system, the legal system,

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:44.150
how decentralized, and how
tough the collective action

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:45.380
issues are.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:48.560
So just going back to
private blockchains,

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.290
technical features--
let's go back.

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:55.790
Membership limited
to authorized nodes.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.910
Transactions can be
partitioned as well.

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:00.260
It's kind of Kelly's point.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.040
Right in the technology, you
can partition and segregate

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.300
information.

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:07.760
So data and ledgers
can be partitioned

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.090
because transactions
can be partitioned.

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:13.160
That doesn't mean you
can't have a layer 2.

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.830
I'm just saying there's a
lot less need for a layer 2,

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:19.590
because they do it in the
data structures itself.

00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:24.900
The consensus is permissioned
private protocols.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.310
They do have a consensus.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:28.320
Somebody has to agree
on the next block.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:35.080
But it's a tight, limited group.

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.260
It does use cryptography,
but often, there's

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.990
something called a
registration authority.

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:46.690
The registration authority
is helping mask data.

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:50.560
So they address
privacy two ways.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.830
They address privacy because
it's a smaller group.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.710
They can actually see
the whole network.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:59:00.090
But even within the network,
even on the network,

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:03.890
they're further
addressing privacy

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:09.590
that Alpha's and my
transaction, Amanda maybe

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:12.350
can't even see, even though
she's on the network,

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.330
because it's encrypted.

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:16.670
And then there's sort of
what's called a registration

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:23.910
authority, or authority within
the system, that can unmask it.

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:24.410
Yes.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.243
AUDIENCE: I just have
a question about the--

00:59:26.243 --> 00:59:32.330
how is a segregated system a
subgroup of two [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:33.810
different from a layer?

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:37.520
If [INAUDIBLE] is already doing
subnetting off of calculations,

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.500
or whatever it may
be-- transactions--

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.015
and then the net [INAUDIBLE]--

00:59:42.015 --> 00:59:42.890
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:45.057
So I've got another question
I have to follow up on.

00:59:45.057 --> 00:59:47.810
I have to follow up on
Brotish's Corda question,

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.030
and now James' question
about, well, wait a minute.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:53.368
How is this partitioning
different than a layer 2?

00:59:53.368 --> 00:59:55.160
And it's beyond my
knowledge, but I'm going

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.460
to see if I can get it for you.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:03.560
That's a good-- they're
both-- they're good questions.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.460
And then smart contracts--
yes, smart contracts

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:14.600
can happen on these systems as
well as permissionless systems.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.820
IBM-- they say
they use chaincode.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.570
But they say chaincode really
could be any language, at least

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:24.745
they advertise, and
no native currency.

01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:26.120
So that's kind of
the technical--

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.440
not deeply technical.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.120
It's not like learning
hash functions.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.360
But yes to cryptography.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.150
Well, they partition
the ledgers.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:37.100
The consensus is closed loop.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.950
Yes, they have smart contracts.

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:42.920
But they can even have
additional privacy.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.030
But it comes at a cost.

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:47.840
There's an authority
that has to protect

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.900
something-- a registration
authority inside of it.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.310
Oh, I forgot.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:54.870
The code is generally
open source.

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.700
It does not have
to be open source.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.430
Hyperledger is
open source, but it

01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:00.850
doesn't have to be open source.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.030
So this was from
one of the readings.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:08.530
I'm just putting up that
chart that was in the reading.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:09.960
And I just found it helpful.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.860
It's a different way.

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.090
It's not Gensler's way.

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:14.660
It's somebody else's way
of thinking about Ethereum,

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.870
Hyperledger, and Corda.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:18.480
I'm only using
Hyperledger and Corda

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.170
because they're two of the
biggest private platforms.

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.220
There are many others.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.600
Different programming
language-- you

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.120
might say, from a business
point of view, who cares?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.810
And to some level,
you're probably right.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:37.940
But you're not completely right.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.120
I mean, there's probably
more that people can write

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.190
on top of Hyperledger Fabric.

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:49.470
They say more developers could
work on that than Solidity.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:52.760
Governance-- that's
the governance

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.250
of the system itself.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.320
They all can do smart contracts.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.110
We've talked about consensus.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.740
And the scalability
is much harder.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.870
Ethereum, remember, almost
crashed on CryptoKitties

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:08.220
last December.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.820
And I shared that story about
one initial coin offering

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.900
was 30% of the Ethereum
network on the one day

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.995
it was closing [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:19.995 --> 01:02:25.190
DTCC, in a given day,
can do as much as 100

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.960
million transactions in a day.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.820
That's the Depository
Trust Corporation.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.460
Ethereum does about a million
and a half transactions a day,

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:42.040
and Bitcoin, about 400,000 to
500,000 transactions a day.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:49.120
So you know, we've still got a
ways to go on this scalability.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.340
So what about
traditional databases?

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.800
I think that to talk
about permissioned

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.780
versus permissionless,
a lot of people,

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.540
even some of my
colleagues here at MIT,

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.430
says, well, if you're talking
about Hyperledger, Corda,

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:06.220
and Fabric and Corda,
that's like Oracle.

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.350
That's just a
traditional database.

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:11.280
That's not really blockchain.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.390
The Bitcoin and
blockchain purist

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:20.160
would say, if it doesn't have
Nakamoto consensus, forget it.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.490
It's not a member of the club.

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:26.240
That's not how I've chosen
to teach that this class,

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.710
as you know.

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:29.960
I think both are
relevant, possibly,

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.750
to business solutions, and it's
worthwhile to think of them.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.950
But so what separates--

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.390
and this is not in the
reading, so I'm just going to,

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:39.800
you know, kind of--

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.640
but what separates it versus
a traditional database?

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.590
Well, back to the basics.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:50.160
Permissioned private blockchains
have append-only logs.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.320
You're adding-- I know.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.390
Thank you, Brotish.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:59.190
But basically, they
have append-only logs.

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:02.880
Traditional databases-- and I'm
at the edge of my knowledge--

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.870
you can create.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:04.710
You can read.

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:05.550
You can update.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.263
You can delete.

01:04:08.263 --> 01:04:12.490
Again, I'm taking the mainstream
traditional databases,

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:15.430
or what's called
CRUD, if you wish--

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:22.610
C-R-U-D. Whereas these,
you always are adding

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.010
to the database.

01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:28.790
Two, these databases
use cryptography

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:30.530
to have commitment schemes.

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:33.590
You may remember, what
is a hash function?

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:36.350
It not only compresses
data, but it means

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:39.430
you're committing to the data.

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:42.040
And when you finish The New
York Times crossword puzzle,

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.960
you can actually send it in.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.880
And if it's identical to--

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.140
and hash it.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.420
And if you remember our
discussion about The New York

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:53.110
Times crossword puzzle, if it's
hashed, and the hashes match,

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.250
voilá.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.610
You solved The New York
Times crossword puzzle.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:02.480
So you can have commitment
schemes for the data.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.190
And it can be distributed.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:06.220
Yes, Joequinn.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.040
AUDIENCE: So even
if it's append-only,

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.700
if you take away
the proof of work,

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.930
you can rewrite it in
a very quick manner.

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.700
PROFESSOR: So Joequinn's
raising a very important point.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:23.940
So even if it's append-only,
you get rid of proof of work,

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.700
can't somebody go
in and rewrite it?

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:33.480
Permissioned blockchains make
a different trade-off on trust.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.630
Permissionless system say,
we're going to address trust

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.850
through this proof of work.

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.480
And at least 51% of
all of the network

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.370
has to, in essence, agree
and validate, and the like.

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:47.970
Permissioned
basically are saying,

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:53.780
I'm going to trust
the 10 or 15 or 20

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:58.750
nodes that are in the system
can validate against each other.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:03.980
And so there's something
about the club that's

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.260
authorized in the network.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.390
But they're still
using append-only.

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:10.610
You're right that
within those 20,

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:13.250
somebody could try to
rush through and do

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:16.190
a whole entire new append-only.

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:22.345
But then within the
club, it's exposed.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.640
AUDIENCE: If the club
agrees that the last two

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.110
days have to be rewritten, they
can do it in a very easy way.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.100
PROFESSOR: Correct.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.650
But I would contend
that even in Bitcoin,

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:36.490
if 10,000 nodes decided to
rewrite the last two days,

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:38.220
they could.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:38.720
It's a--

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.265
AUDIENCE: Taken a lot of
time, because they have--

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:41.890
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:42.837
AUDIENCE: --to find--

01:06:42.837 --> 01:06:43.920
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.663
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

01:06:45.663 --> 01:06:47.940
So what Joequinn's
saying is in Bitcoin,

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.270
what protects against that
is partly the proof of work,

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:55.320
and partly that it takes
10,000, or at least 51% of them,

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.740
probably, to rewrite
the last two days.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.690
The economic
incentives in Bitcoin

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:04.980
is, is why waste all your
computer power and electricity

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.880
and so forth doing that when
you may as well just go forward?

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.050
I think Bitcoin could be
susceptible to state actors.

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:17.010
I think, you know, if
North Korea wanted--

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:21.210
or Russia wanted-- to spend
probably single digit billions,

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:24.870
but at most maybe 10 billion,
they could overwhelm the whole

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.270
system and bring--

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:29.790
they could do a 51%
attack by buying up

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:34.700
enough mining
equipment, the ASICs,

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.850
and just bigfooting
the whole system.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.800
But it's multiple billio-- and
there's academic papers on this

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.300
now.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.920
It's single digit billions.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.740
A state actor could--

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.330
an individual wouldn't
want to do it,

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:51.680
because you'd crush $110 billion
market cap down to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.885
So that would be kind of unwise.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:02.300
This is a very critical part
of what a private blockchain--

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.850
to me, economically,
what a private blockchain

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:09.200
can do and facilitate better
than a traditional database.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.630
I'm not saying this
list is the only list.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.990
I'm not even saying this list
is completely the right list.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.600
This is Gary
Gensler's list trying

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.600
to say, what's the
business that separates

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.340
traditional blockchains?

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.540
Append-only timestamping.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.020
Some cryptography
and schemes that

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:35.080
makes the data immutable so
you can put it in a ledger--

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.630
so it's back to
ledgers and so forth--

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:40.069
and thus, finality
of settlement.

01:08:40.069 --> 01:08:43.660
Does anybody want to remind the
class what settlement means?

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:47.510
Anybody?

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.990
Take a shot.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:52.147
Where's my accountant?

01:08:52.147 --> 01:08:55.270
Aviva's not here.

01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:56.150
Oh, please.

01:08:58.705 --> 01:09:02.633
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
do with the UTXO.

01:09:02.633 --> 01:09:04.970
PROFESSOR: No,
forget about UTXO.

01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:06.859
Just tell me what
settlement means.

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:09.865
AUDIENCE: Oh, like, making
off your debit and credit.

01:09:09.865 --> 01:09:12.229
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
debits and credits.

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:18.420
Settlement means changing
the data in a ledger,

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.720
and doing it with finality.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:26.120
In essence, do I
have $10 or $11?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.569
A payment settlement system
is when you finally say,

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:33.390
I've got $11, no longer $10.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:38.930
And Amanda's got
$9 instead of $10.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:39.649
You went down.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:40.409
I went up.

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:41.170
Is that all right?

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:42.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:43.870
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:46.210
You'll hear a lot about
clearing and settlement.

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:48.880
The word settlement
means to finally change

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.029
the data in a ledger,
and that we're not

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:53.830
going to come back to it.

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:54.750
It's done.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.680
It's final.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.600
If we're moving
something of value--

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.580
and the value could be grapes.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.080
The value could be diamonds.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.490
The value can be real estate.

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.780
The value can be money.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:08.000
But if we're moving
something of value

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.440
and storing it on a ledger, it's
more adaptable to blockchain.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.960
If you're doing
some database that

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.840
has nothing to do with
things of value and ledger,

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:26.250
you don't need final
immutable settlement.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.530
I would contend you
probably have less reason

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.420
to use any of this
blockchain stuff.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.610
Zan.

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:35.620
AUDIENCE: Can you
maybe talk a little bit

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.050
about a real-world
implementation of this?

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:41.470
So I saw recently that Walmart
is forcing their suppliers

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:45.840
to basically add themselves
into this private blockchain

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.198
to basically track
their supply chain.

01:10:48.198 --> 01:10:49.990
I'm having a really
hard time understanding

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:52.240
why that needs to
be on a blockchain,

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.010
whether permissioned
or nonpermissioned,

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:56.920
and why that needs to be.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.500
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, why is Walmart

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.290
putting supply chain with a
bunch of agricultural products

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:03.910
on a blockchain?

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:08.255
Agricultural products
are something of value,

01:11:08.255 --> 01:11:13.020
whether it's corn,
wheat, grapes.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.490
It's something of value.

01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:18.700
And when it moves from one
owner to another owner,

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.200
if you keep that
on a ledger, you

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.350
can record that
Amanda has the grapes,

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:26.450
and Gary no longer
has the grapes.

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:31.770
And another thing that
blockchains help with

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.030
is they lower the cost of
reconciling multiple databases.

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:39.780
We could keep-- as
in agriculture--

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.280
we can keep separate
ledgers, separate databases.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.720
The farmers keeping
their database.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.970
The wholesaler with
the grain elevators

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.240
are keeping their database,
and up the supply chain,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.280
from the farm, to
the grain elevator,

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.950
to the millers and
merchants, all the way

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:04.560
to General Mills, all the
way to Kroger and the store.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.400
Right now, those are multiple
databases that, by and large,

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.470
don't have to communicate.

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:14.070
So the question is, will
Walmart get to the place

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:15.900
where that's a good idea?

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:22.030
But I'm just pointing out if
you're moving things of value

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:25.870
where you want to keep final
settlement that you know who

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:29.650
owns that thing of
value in ledgers,

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:33.620
and lastly, if you want to
lower any reconciliation--

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.950
if you have multiple
ledgers and things of value,

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:47.170
blockchain, I think,
is more valuable.

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.448
Zan's asking, well,
is that Walmart?

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:49.990
I don't know.

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.090
We're going to find out.

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:53.148
Tom, and I've got about
seven minutes to finish.

01:12:53.148 --> 01:12:54.690
AUDIENCE: There was
a talk last year.

01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:57.070
Somebody [INAUDIBLE] came
in and talked about the--

01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:59.050
they were then
piloting this program.

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.780
But the example they used
was, in E. coli outbreak

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.830
in their spinach supply, rather
than taking a whole supplier,

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:08.050
an entire wholesaler
offline and recalling

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.300
all of that product,
through the blockchain,

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.760
they could trace it
to a particular farm

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.030
and a single point of origin
almost instantaneously

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:18.352
and just take off a much
smaller portion of it.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:19.560
PROFESSOR: So let me do this.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.320
Let me just-- hold on.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.885
I know we've got
two questions here.

01:13:21.885 --> 01:13:24.940
Let me just hold on, just
for-- is that all right?

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:25.440
All right.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.660
We got permission.

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:30.140
So this was what we
talked about earlier--

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:34.430
Coase's trade-offs of costs.

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:36.943
Let me try another
one, which is going

01:13:36.943 --> 01:13:41.310
to be my shot at blockchains
and traditional databases.

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:43.980
So one is access control.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.870
Who has access to the ledger?

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:50.060
Who has access, if I
might, to the data?

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.180
Three different types of
approaches we talked about--

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:56.420
open permissionless,
multiple permissioned,

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.410
and client server.

01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:59.090
I'm using the word
client server just

01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:01.190
to say traditional database.

01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:03.200
You can use another words.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.530
But I'm just trying to say
three different types of data

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:07.340
structures.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.410
And to Zan's question,
why would you

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.420
be in one bucket versus another?

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.710
And I'm saying this.

01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:15.170
If you're a venture
capitalist one day,

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:18.890
and somebody comes in to you
with a blockchain solution,

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.600
this is the same thing.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.400
Hopefully, you'll
make it better.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.890
This is just my approach to it.

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:29.360
Public blockchain-- do
you need, basically,

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.090
public write capability,
that lots of people

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:34.550
can write to these ledgers?

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:36.230
Do you need that somewhere?

01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:39.830
Secondly, do you want some peer
to peer transaction capability

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:44.040
across the distributed ledger?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.155
Do you kind of not want
any central intermediary?

01:14:46.155 --> 01:14:48.030
Maybe you don't want
the central intermediary

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.650
because they're
slow and sluggish.

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:51.525
Maybe you don't want
the central intermediary

01:14:51.525 --> 01:14:53.520
because they have a
lot of economic rents.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.590
It doesn't matter to me
why you want to get rid

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:57.072
of the central intermediary.

01:14:57.072 --> 01:14:59.280
But if you want to get rid
of a central intermediary,

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.630
or lessen their control,
or lower their control,

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:06.690
raise peer to peer transactions,
have a lot of public writing--

01:15:06.690 --> 01:15:09.810
oh, and by the way, if you
want some token economics,

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:11.700
you're probably
somewhere over here.

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.620
I'm not saying you
have to have all four.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.230
But to me, those are
the kind of three

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:18.360
or four things that
are floating around

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.520
why you might be over there.

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.860
Private blockchains--
well, maybe you actually

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:25.960
don't want public
write capability.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.050
You need private.

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:32.110
Whether it's just the Australian
Stock Exchange or 15 to 20 club

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:36.670
deal, you still want kind
of multiple people to write,

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.550
but you want it to be private.

01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:46.670
But if you still need finality
of data and an append-only log,

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:48.990
that you need this appending--

01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:53.090
the log, and you need
some public verifiability,

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.880
that you still need that
data to be verified amongst--

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.360
and this public means
15 or 20 players.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.280
But you need it to be
able to be verified--

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.210
so the trust mechanism is
not thousands and open.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:08.330
The trust mechanism is
15 or 20 or 5 parties.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.530
But you still need it--

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:11.600
you might be there.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.630
Where I come out is there's
some cases that you just

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:17.470
don't need any of this.

01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:21.190
There's a trusted party
that hosts the data.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:23.920
Your trust mechanism
is one party.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.570
The trusted party can do the--

01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.460
I use the letters CRUD.

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:36.390
That's the create, and update,
and delete, and so forth.

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:40.400
And that's based on client
service architecture,

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.170
this client server architecture.

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:45.260
There's always, in that
circumstance, somebody right

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:49.250
in the middle that
basically owns,

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:54.130
updates, governs that
whole architecture.

01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:59.050
My business judgment
on this is if you're

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:03.620
moving things of value, you
want those things to value

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:08.340
to have some final
settlement and immutability.

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.710
And immutability
append-only logs give you

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:13.550
some of that final settlement.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:15.800
We talked very briefly
about a lawsuit

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.690
that was 300 plus years ago--
the Crawford case in Scotland

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:22.340
that you won't have to remember.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:25.820
But this-- watch this.

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.380
So steal this from me.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.230
Just do me a favor.

01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:29.070
Just steal it.

01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.570
OK.

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:31.610
Right now, I have
a right of action.

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.310
But if you give it to-- who
are you going to give it to?

01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:37.780
I don't have any
rights against you.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.870
No.

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:39.380
Well, wait.

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.020
It depends whether he
knew you stole it from me.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:45.270
But it's gone.

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:47.670
That's final settlement.

01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:50.250
Those $2 are gone.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.930
That's final settlement.

01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:52.770
It's immutable.

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:54.270
I can't get them back.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:55.050
What, Christopher?

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:55.820
You want them?

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.570
AUDIENCE: I just was
asking for the money.

01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:59.550
PROFESSOR: You were
asking for the money.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.580
I just use that as
a visualization.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.780
Money is a social consensus
and a social construct.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.910
But if you think of it
in terms of ledgers--

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:09.900
look, the money's gone.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:10.890
I can't get it.

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:12.570
That's it, you know?

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:13.470
That's good.

01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:16.340
You all go to Sloan, I can tell.

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.490
But it's an important concept.

01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:22.750
I think of this whole that way.

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.870
So there were two
questions, and then we'll--

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:27.150
and then this is the
decentralized end.

01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:30.330
Bitcoin and Ethereum are kind
of at the decentralized end.

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:34.160
I would contend Bitcoin's more
decentralized than Ethereum.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.610
And centralized databases--
initial coin offerings

01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:39.170
that we'll talk
about later, I think,

01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.670
are actually maybe
a little bit more

01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:42.920
centralized, even, than
permissioned blockchains.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.140
But we'll get to that.

01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.970
AUDIENCE: No, mine
was already answered.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.428
And then the other
comment was more

01:18:48.428 --> 01:18:49.640
about the supply chain link.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.557
When you think about the
millions and millions

01:18:51.557 --> 01:18:54.160
of dollars, the
element of transparency

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.930
that blockchain kind of
brings in to all the parties

01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:59.570
probably saves an
insane amount of money

01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:01.950
to what you're talking
about kind of reconciling

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.470
all the databases.

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:08.650
PROFESSOR: So
we're going to talk

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:12.400
about finance next Thursday
and some of the strengths

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.902
and weaknesses in finance,
and some of the attributes,

01:19:14.902 --> 01:19:16.360
and you know, one
of the readings--

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.950
Sheila Bair-- and
there's a bunch

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.050
of optional readings
about what's

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:23.108
happened after the financial
crisis and so forth.

01:19:23.108 --> 01:19:25.150
And then we're going to
talk about the economics.

01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:28.840
But I've had three or four
groups come in already talking

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.030
about the final projects.

01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:32.680
So I'll just say, think
about whatever you're working

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.950
on as this new
technology-- blockchain--

01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:38.590
whether it's permissioned
or permissionless--

01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:42.820
either one-- does this new
technology really address some

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.450
pain point that you're
trying to solve,

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:50.220
whether it's about
payment systems or--

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.500
actually, there's a group
that's talking about doing

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.730
supply chain on wine.

01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:56.930
And I figured, why not?

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:58.070
I'll probably approve it.

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:04.940
But it's, what is the pain
point that you're actually

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.320
trying to solve?

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.070
Or will decentralized
peer to peer networking

01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:15.000
somehow create a business
opportunity in a new model?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.390
It might not be a pain point.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.330
It might be a
business opportunity

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:22.620
that decentralized
systems solve.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.380
Or it might be an opportunity
that token economics

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.430
can help solve.

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:30.400
But if there's no pain
point you're solving,

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.390
no token economics, no
decentralization peer to peer,

01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:38.280
I ask you to use your
critical reasoning

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.940
and move to the next use
case, because this is really

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.460
about-- this is
a business class.

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.640
This is about finding places
for this incredible set

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.745
of new technologies in
the context of markets

01:20:52.745 --> 01:20:57.720
and to have a really
healthy sense of ground

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.600
truth about what's possible.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.670
If not, traditional databases.

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:03.810
Move on.

01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:05.880
I'm not looking for
projects at the end

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.670
of the semester that are
using traditional databases.

01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:12.000
It's got to really
use blockchain.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.330
So I thank you.

01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:15.380
I'll see you next Thursday.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.960
PROFESSOR STRANG:
OK, let's start

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.890
with a review and preview.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.350
I put a P up there
because we're really

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.080
looking into the Fourier part
that just started this morning.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.260
And there'll be some homework
from these early sections

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.400
about the Fourier
stuff, so we maybe we

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.400
should just do a few of those
problems or discuss here today.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.880
Just in advance.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.810
Can I say one thing about MATLAB
and the MATLAB homework first?

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.990
And maybe open a
conversation about it?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.340
So there's really two
different problems

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.260
that I'm personally
quite interested in.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.280
Two model, I'll
say model problems

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.640
because they're for regular
polygons in a circle.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.910
And I'll draw an octagon again.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.170
So M sides.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.800
And I'm interested in
as M goes to infinity.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.230
And I'm interested in
two different problems.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:46.690
So one of them is our MATLAB
problem, is Laplace's equation.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.920
What was it, four?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.500
With u=0 on the circle.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
OK, so that's our problem,
totally open for discussion.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.230
How many have started on that?

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.051
Oh, good.

00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:06.550
OK.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.900
Well, then you all know
more about it than I.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.580
And that's great.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.050
I'd be happy to learn.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.700
So have I said everything there?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.500
Yeah, we've got Poisson's
equation inside.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.940
We've got u=0 on the circle,
so the problem's well defined

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.490
and the solution should be
one minus x squared minus y

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.400
squared.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.490
So that's the correct solution.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.360
Maybe I can also tell you
about the second problem

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.270
that I'm interested in.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.450
Because it hasn't come
up in class but it's

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.330
very important too.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.370
It would be the
eigenvalue problem.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.140
So this is problem number
one, the steady state problem

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.330
when you've got a source
and you want to find out

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.590
the temperature distribution.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.220
The problem number two would
be the eigenvalue problem,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.050
-u_xx-u_yy.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.590
I take those minuses so that
the eigenvalue will be positive.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.540
So that's what the eigenvalue
problem might look like.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.240
And again let me say,
with u=0 on the boundary.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.090
On the circle.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.500
OK, so a person would say this
is Laplace's eigenvalue problem

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.640
because we have
Laplace's equation.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.540
We've got eigenvalue.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.760
As always, it's not linear
because we have two unknowns,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.420
lambda's multiplying u.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.030
And we have boundary
conditions, and this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.140
would describe the normal
modes, for example,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.000
of a circular drum.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.520
If I had a drum--
Or a polygon drum.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.780
So maybe I connect, to
actually build the drum,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.140
I might fold in the sides
there and have a polygon.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.090
And again, I hope
that the eigenvalues

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.220
of the polygon, this
equation in the polygon,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.660
which are not known, by the way.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.700
To the best to my knowledge,
we know it only for M=3,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.290
which would be an equilateral
triangle, and M=4,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.100
which would be a square.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.060
And those eigenvalues, because
of Fourier or something

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.130
are humanly doable.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.980
But I think five on up is,
I may be wrong about six,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.540
I'm not sure about M=6, a
hexagon sometimes gives you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.210
enough help.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.120
But beyond that
you're on your own.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.720
With finite elements
to help you.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.080
So there's a whole sequence
of eigenfunctions u,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.450
eigenvalues lambda, just the
way there were in one dimension.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.090
And on the circle
they involve Bessel.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.970
That's where Bessel showed up.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.640
He figured out the
functions and they're not

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.270
especially nice functions.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.630
But they're studied
for centuries.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.270
Bessel functions come into that.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.420
But, here I have
the same question.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.950
I mean, let me just say, for
me this could be a UROP project

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.120
if anybody was an
undergraduate, or it

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.000
could be a project over
January or something.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.900
I'd like to know
something about what

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.500
happens as M goes to infinity,
as the polygon approaches

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.520
the circle.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.280
So I'm hoping maybe on
the homework that come in,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.720
if it's not too difficult,
and maybe it's not,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.750
to let M go up a bit.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.910
There is one thing.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.680
That the code we're working
with is linear elements, right?

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.820
We're using linear
finite elements.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.050
So we're not getting
high accuracy.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.540
So I would really
like to move up

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.810
to quadratic elements,
at least, you

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.420
remember quadratic
elements would

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:48.260
be ones where-- Well, let
me draw the one that we've

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.160
drawn in class before.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.630
We only have to
look at one triangle

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.790
and then we cut it up
into triangular elements

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.470
by taking some pieces here,
taking the points above,

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.650
which I hope are now
correct on the website.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.150
Connecting those edges,
and then connecting these.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.170
Is that right?

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:18.210
Is that our mesh?

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.640
So that mesh is controlled
by N. One, two, N points.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:32.810
Also, N is going to have to get
large too, to give me accuracy.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.210
And another way
toward more accuracy

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:42.320
is, instead of linear
elements, second degree.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.710
So do you remember
I wrote those down?

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:51.230
Let me take that little triangle
out here as a bigger triangle.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.920
It would look something
like that, I guess.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.170
The second degree elements
have those six mesh points.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.590
You remember I drew those but
we didn't really have time

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.330
to get further with them.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.640
The trial functions phi, which
are one at a typical mesh

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.800
point and zero at all the
others, they are computable.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.640
We're up to second degree, so
it's a little-- Second degree

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.400
things, then the
first derivatives,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.420
which come into the
integrations, are linear.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.370
And not constant.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.960
So a little bit harder.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.290
But finite elements, linear
or quadratic, or higher,

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.510
could be used for this problem.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:45.280
As we know, and
for this problem.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.670
What I wanted to add, that
I've not mentioned in class,

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.360
and I think we may just
not get a chance to do it,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.710
is what does the finite
element method look

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.700
like for an eigenvalue problem?

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.120
Because eigenvalues
are highly important.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.120
That's the different
way to understand.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.890
There's the matrix
K and its entries.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.420
But then there are
the eigenvalues.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.140
And you might
think that, what do

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.710
you think is the discrete
eigenvalue problem copying

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.390
this one?

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.510
Here's my point.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.370
Your first guess would be,
well this is like K, right?

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:34.110
This is like KU, right? (K2D)U,
I should call it, maybe.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.420
Well, I'll call it K, because
K2D I have specifically

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:46.170
reserved for the
Laplace stiffness

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.600
matrix on a square mesh, square
mesh with triangles, the K2D.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.970
That was one specific matrix
for one specific mesh,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.140
and here we have
a different mesh.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:05.060
So I should just call it K. Ok,
I think if anybody was going

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.290
to make a guess, they
would say OK, KU=Lambda*U.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.760
Maybe I'll use capital Lambda,
because I'm using capital U.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:28.330
Is this the finite element
method eigenvalue problem?

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.270
And if you answered yes,
I would have to say, well

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.930
that's a reasonable answer.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.120
But it's wrong.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.990
The eigenvalue problem, when I
take the differential equation

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.760
for the Laplace,
Laplace's equation,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.240
lambda u on the right side,
and I go to do finite elements,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.110
it produces K.
Out of this stuff,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.160
out of the weak
form, all that stuff.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.110
But it produces another
matrix on the right-hand side

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.840
from the constant term, and we
have not really mentioned it,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.910
it's the mass matrix.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.580
So this, instead of
just the identity here,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.170
there's a mass matrix.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.570
So that is the problem
that you could do.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:28.080
I could've made
a MATLAB project.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.730
I bet I'd do it next fall.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.680
Right?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.250
You guys did the
first one, this one.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.850
Or you are doing it now.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.460
And I'm going to pause in a
minute for questions about it,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.000
or discussion of it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.850
But this one brings in something
called the mass matrix.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:58.620
So let me just say
what those are.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.000
If I write down the
entries in the mass matrix,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.930
you'll sort of get an
idea of why they are.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.680
So what are the entries
in the stiffness matrix?

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:18.500
K_ij, you remember, is the
integral of the d phi_i/dx,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.940
d phi_j/dx.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:31.810
Plus d phi_i/dy,
d phi_j/dy, dxdy,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.190
and that's what's
you're computing.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.700
And that's what that
code is computing.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.270
And when phi is
linear, phi linear,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:47.500
then slopes are constant.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.300
So all you have to do, and what
that code in the book is doing,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.180
is figuring out
what are the slopes.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.190
These things are
constant, so we just

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:04.420
need to know the area
of the integration

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.180
where we're integrating.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.300
The area, triangle by triangle.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.310
Fine.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.970
That's what we're doing.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.860
That's what that code
is just set up to do.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.550
Now, I have to tell you what
is M_ij, the mass matrix.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.630
I just think you
don't want to have--

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.820
we haven't done too badly
with finite elements in here.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.180
We did it in 1-D, where we
got it kind of straight.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.520
And now we're seeing what
it looks like in 2-D.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.170
But I had not really
mentioned a mass matrix.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.400
So here it comes.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.370
The mass matrix
will be the integral

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.870
of phi_i times phi_j dxdy.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:57.680
It's the zero order, no
derivatives, just plain zero

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.340
order, as you'd
expect from the fact

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:09.280
that the term in the
continuous part is zero order.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.100
So it's this mass
matrix that comes in.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:20.690
And maybe we could just look to
see which entries will be zero

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.730
and which will not.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.330
How sparse is it?

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.710
What does the mass
matrix look like?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.040
And can we just,
let me do 1-D first.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.760
So there's a phi, right?

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.470
There's another one.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.070
There's another one.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.960
So, what do you think about the
mass matrix, one phi multiplied

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.770
by another phi and integrated?

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.570
Is it diagonal?

00:14:51.570 --> 00:15:00.170
No, because each phi
overlaps its two neighbors.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.850
So tell me what kind of a
matrix M is going to be?

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.080
In 1-D. Tridiagonal.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.560
It'll be tridiagonal.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.550
Now, so was K. So
K and M actually

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.990
have non-zeroes in
the same places.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.860
the same sparsity pattern.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.830
But, of course, not the
same numbers in there.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:31.690
K had minus ones and twos
and fours and minus ones.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.190
What can you tell me about
this tridiagonal matrix?

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.150
When I integrate that
against this, well,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.130
again I would do it
element by element

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.330
because this against this,
they only overlap here.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:48.830
Right?

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.920
I'll just draw the one
place that they overlap.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.160
And what's the point?

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.510
They're both positive.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:02.080
So the mass matrix is, its
rows don't add to zero.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.840
Its rows tend to add to one.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.370
But it's not diagonal,
that's the difference.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:14.230
OK, so I just felt
I couldn't feel--

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:20.100
I wouldn't have done a
decent job in describing

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.780
finite elements if I
didn't describe this.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.480
Didn't mention this mass matrix.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.880
And maybe I'd better
say where it comes from.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.190
Because eigenvalue problems, it
may come number two, but that's

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.440
pretty high up the list.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:50.380
So let me tell you where does
this mass matrix come from.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.470
First, let me tell
you about eigenvalues

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.750
of a-- matrix eigenvalues.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.090
So the answer was, is this
the finite element eigenvalue

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.770
problem?

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.690
Only if there's an M there.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:12.260
And now I want to, OK, first of
all, what MATLAB command solves

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.960
that problem?

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.770
Let's just be a little
practical for a moment.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.560
What MATLAB command
gives me the matrix

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.230
of eigenvectors, the
matrix of eigenvalues

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:32.450
would come from eig of what?

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.320
I'd call this the generalized
eigenvalue problem.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.690
Generalized because it's
got somebody over here.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:45.270
And it's just K,M. Or of
course you get the same answer,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.970
well you get the
same eigenvalues,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.770
I guess the same
eigenvectors, yeah, if you--

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:57.660
Or eig of M inverse
K, of course.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.660
If you want to do it
with just one matrix

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.690
then bring M inverse over here.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:06.700
But, M inverse, the inverse
of this tridiagonal matrix,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.350
is full.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.190
No zeroes in the inverse.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.630
So everybody would much prefer
this tridiagonal-tridiagonal

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.290
one.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.860
So that's how
MATLAB would do it.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:25.590
And what I want to know
is, back in this problem,

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.910
how close do the
finite element guys

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:41.500
come, on polygons, come to the
correct solution on circles.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.480
I'm hoping that for
problem one you can maybe

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.720
keep M and N equal,
or maybe N may

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.050
be four times M or something.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:58.270
And let them grow and see.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.230
Well, for example, at
the center of the circle,

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.360
or how quickly do you approach
the correct answer, one,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.700
at the center of the circle?

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.920
I think it's going
to be a good problem.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.950
Let me open to, so I started
out just talking there.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.390
What about the MATLAB problem.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:24.240
You made a start
on it, is it going?

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.320
Have you got a graph, maybe,
or what's reasonable to graph,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.740
to give Peter to look at?

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.420
Who's done something
on that MATLAB problem?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.240
Yeah, go ahead tell
us all what to do.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.840
AUDIENCE: I made the
triangle bisection and--

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.270
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, right.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:55.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] and I
found that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.070
changes to M.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.040
PROFESSOR STRANG:
With M more, I see.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:07.330
So if you just fixed M
like eight, and let N get,

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.080
it didn't change significantly.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.070
It wouldn't, of course,
converge to the right answer.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.840
It'll converge, if it does,
to some kind of an answer,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.650
for the polygon.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.150
Right.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.730
That's right.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.490
So you know, as I
wrote the problem

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.980
I didn't know
whether I dared say

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.030
let M get increased
too, but of course

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.770
that's the real question.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.190
And what happened then?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.400
Did error shrink?

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.324
OK, and now maybe it's
possible to see how fast

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:42.490
or something that's always--

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.206
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:47.080
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ah.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.800
OK, at the center.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.930
OK, then I hope
for more comment.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.110
Let me say one more thing.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:21:00.190
My theory is that the
error at the center

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:06.740
is quite a bit smaller than the
error closer to the boundary.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:13.340
I would be interested in an
error-- Is it fairly even?

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.200
Oh, my theory's wrong.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.860
It wouldn't be the first time.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.390
And maybe because it's linear.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:28.040
Yeah, my theory is more for
better elements, like these.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.920
I'd be interested to know.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:37.070
Why do I think, why
do I have this theory,

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.036
which you guys are going to
prove wrong anyway, but still.

00:21:41.036 --> 00:21:42.410
After you've proved
it wrong, you

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.190
won't listen to me
if I tell it to you.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.970
So now I'll tell it.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:51.730
My theory is that the
error around the boundary

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.217
is, there's no error
at these vertices,

00:21:56.217 --> 00:21:57.800
and then there's
sort of a going to be

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.540
an error because the real
answer is not zero along here.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.670
It's sort of near
zero, but not quite.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.060
You know, there's an error.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.900
So there's errors around
here, from getting

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.620
the boundary wrong.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.190
Squaring it off.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.910
But my theory is that
errors, the boundary stuff,

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.360
drops off quickly
as you go inside.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.480
That's why I think, from those,
you remember those-- Well,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.190
we'll see them again
either today or Friday,

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:36.320
those r^n*cos(nx) type things?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.050
That cos(n*theta)?

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.580
Yeah, you remember those
are the typical solutions

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.780
to Laplace's equation.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:49.070
And then so that if-- And it
has some coefficient, of course,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.390
a_n.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:56.080
And I look at that, that
might be a piece of error.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.140
And it's way bigger when
r is one and way smaller

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.120
when r is zero.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.660
So anyway, that's
sort of my theory.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.470
That if you have--
Like, physically.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:17.890
You have a circular
plate and you're

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.850
maintaining the
boundary temperature

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.720
at some sort of oscillation.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.050
Like, near one but
up and down from one.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:33.080
Then I think further
inside, it doesn't know.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.290
It hardly knows about
that oscillation.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.020
This is my theory.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.280
That toward the center
of the circle it

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.260
only sees kind of an
average boundary temperature

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.390
and not your little
ups and downs.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.970
So when M is big, I
expect that part of error,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:59.250
the up and down part, to be not
so significant in the center.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.660
Anyway, now that's my theory.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:11.320
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Ah, good question.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.580
So if we only looked
at the center,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.060
would it all be the same?

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.900
I mean, if we're only
looking at that one point

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:28.900
where it should be one at the
center, but along the thing,

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.910
I don't know.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.770
If you look at both, and
see a significant difference

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.110
in the behavior
I'd be interested.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.960
You know, all these problems
are things that there's

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.600
no single solution to.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:53.416 --> 00:24:55.790
PROFESSOR STRANG: The error
between one minus r squared--

00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:04.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.770
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, right,
we've got slope error, too.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.100
That's a very significant point.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.130
I see, right.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.930
So the slope error's in there.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.440
Everybody knows,
then, everybody--

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.810
In working the
problem, I mentioned

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:29.420
that the boundary conditions
in this piece of pie

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.460
were zero along here
and normal derivative,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.300
somehow it got printed du/dh,
but that was an accident.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:42.170
It should've been
du/dn, dn is zero.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.610
So Neumann conditions
on the thing

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.020
and then I was a little
scared about that point,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.560
but I think phooey on it.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.640
It's just, don't worry about it.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.040
But what I was going to say.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:07.430
How do you, what do you do to
take into account this du/dn=0,

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:13.520
this slope condition on
these long boundaries?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.790
What should you do
in finite elements

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.790
to take account for that?

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.490
And the answer is,
in one nice word?

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.510
Nothing.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.180
Right, nothing.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.840
Your finite element
method should not,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.010
you don't impose any condition
along these boundaries.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:35.260
Just use the code as it is
with zeroes on this boundary.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.060
And it should work, yeah.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:39.910
It should work.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.910
Any comments on--
Other people, did you

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:48.390
get reasonable results, or?

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.150
Tell me something.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:55.310
Because you guys looked at
those graphs and I have not.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.930
Any feedback yet?

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.870
On those?

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.930
I'm happy to get
email, too, about.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.780
So all the email,
first of all they've

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:09.310
corrected the typos in the
original coordinate positions.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.650
And now they've
pointed out I'd better

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:19.000
look at M is very, very welcome.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.760
It doesn't mean that
everybody has to do this,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.450
if you've completed
that MATLAB assignment,

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:30.970
you never want to see it again,
and you've kept M=8, it's OK.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.290
But if you're
interested to see what

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.540
happens if M goes to 16 or
32, I'm interested also.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.500
Right, yeah.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.730
OK, so anyway that's the problem
we're really thinking about.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:50.100
And that's the problem
that is equally important,

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:55.540
but it seemed reasonable
just to do one of the two.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.690
And we were set
up to do, we have

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.490
the code for the
stiffness matrix,

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:07.140
we would need a new code
to do these integrals.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:13.860
Because this will be
linear times linear, right?

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.430
I'll have to compute
that one times this one

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:23.480
and I would need new
formulas that are not there.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.830
I'd need formulas for, this
will be linear times linear

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:31.710
so I'll be integrating
x squared type stuff.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.060
And xy's, because I'm
2-D, and y squareds.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:43.240
So it would take a little
more code, but not much.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.720
I think the math-- Oh,
here's a question for you.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.190
Here's a question for you.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.100
Suppose I have my trial
functions, phi_i(x).

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.920
What do they add up to?

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.420
Let me again draw a
mesh, so I've got a mesh.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.500
These are, you
know-- I'm sorry, I

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.890
want to put in some
more triangles here.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.930
Lots of triangles, whatever.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.640
Let me get some
more vertices, too.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.800
I'm getting in trouble.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.190
OK, whatever.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:35.030
So phi_i is the piecewise linear
guy that is one at node i.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.270
So I've got all these
different nodes.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.800
I need a node there, so I've
got one, two, three, there's

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.670
a node, there's more nodes.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.610
If I add them all
up, this is just

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.750
like in an insight question.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.260
I've got all these, you
could add up these hats

00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.620
in 1-D. What's the sum of
the hats in one dimension?

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.670
One.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.470
Good.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.820
The sum is one.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.600
It's a nice fact that
these guys add up to one.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.880
And now why is it
still true here in 2-D,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.080
that these little
pyramids will add to one?

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.720
That's an insight question,
but it's worth thinking about.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.570
Why do those
pyramids add to one?

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.960
Let me leave that question.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.620
I'm thinking about, we haven't
imposed any boundary conditions

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.160
yet.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.680
We've got them all. and I
claim that if we add up all

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.740
the pyramids including the
boundary chopped off pyramids

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.020
from the boundary, that we'll
get one throughout the whole,

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.130
now it'll be phi(x,y).

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.440
Because now I'm moving
to 2-D, with pyramids.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.110
I think we'll still have one.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.890
Let me give you a minute
to think about that one.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:08.170
And then we could turn
to Fourier questions

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:15.340
if you would like, we could do
some problems from the text.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.450
Any thoughts about this guy?

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:30.160
Why should all those individual
pyramids add up to a flat roof?

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.540
Why did it work here?

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:41.580
Well, it worked because you
could see it, right, somehow?

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:47.110
Does it still work if the
nodes are not equally spaced?

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.070
So we've got a hat
function for that guy,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.410
and a hat function for
this guy, and a hat

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.010
function for this guy.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.690
And these guys
are in there, too.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.080
We haven't imposed anything.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:07.670
So those one, two, three,
four, five functions,

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:14.296
five phis, they add
up to one, and why?

00:32:14.296 --> 00:32:15.920
Well, you're going
to say it's obvious,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.110
but that's what professors
are allowed to say.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.100
Things are obvious, you
have to actually say why.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.500
Which is not as easy.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:36.880
So, why do they add to one?

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.700
Let me look inside one element.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.760
Why does the sum
of these two guys

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.310
add to a flat top
inside that interval?

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:57.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.170
PROFESSOR STRANG: At the
end points, you've got it.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.430
Because what's happening
at the end points?

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:10.480
This guy, one of the guys,
the right guy is one.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.160
And all other guys
are zero, right.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.010
And this guy is also at one.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.530
Because it's the right guy.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.280
It has height one
and all others zero.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.960
So at the nodes we
are at one, because

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.570
of one person,
really, one element.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.110
And then?

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:38.370
PROFESSOR STRANG: Right.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.965
But the sum of them is, why
is the sum of them always one,

00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:44.510
why is slope zero?

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.010
Yeah.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.270
The slopes cancel, right.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.340
We know that in between it
will be a linear function.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.390
That would be one
way to look at it.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.770
If I add up a linear function
and a linear function

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.200
the sum is a linear function.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.090
So I'm getting a
linear function,

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:08.800
which is one at those points,
so what is that function?

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.570
One.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.790
Right, you know that's
the straight line.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:16.010
So, that idea will
work here too.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:20.900
Look inside some
little triangle here.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.540
OK, that's got one,
two, three corners, OK.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.900
And if I look at this sum,
what is it at this point?

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.010
If I look at that
sum at this corner,

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.990
one guy is one, the
one for that pyramid.

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.560
And all others are?

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.430
Zero.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:44.410
So the sum is one there,
the sum is one there,

00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:48.070
the sum is one there,
so that blowing up

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.140
this little triangle,
this is at height one,

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.860
this is at height one,
this is at height one,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.440
so what's the roof?

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.530
Flat.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:04.270
It's just a nice way to see the
nice property of these phis.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:14.580
That there's a phi for every
node, and they add to one.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.510
To that's it.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.870
OK, well I was going
to say one more thing

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.600
and I am, about this
eigenvalue problem, just

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.680
because I'll never
have a chance again.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.540
So this is the moment
to say something

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.630
about the eigenvalues.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.940
Lambda.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:41.290
Eigenvalue.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.000
I'm answering the question
where does K come from,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.680
where does M come from?

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:56.610
Well, the eigenvalue is-- Voy we
really got dramatic music here.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:00.410
Is that the Great Gate of
Kiev, I think might be.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.940
Mussorgsky.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.230
If you like drums and big
noise, it's not music actually,

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:11.190
but you got a lot
of noise out of it.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.710
Well, of course, he'd know
more than we do, but still.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:26.650
OK, so the eigenvalues in the
matrix case, for Kx=lambda*M*x,

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:31.000
the eigenvalue problem,
lambda, the lowest eigenvalue,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.980
lambda_lowest, has
a nice property.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:46.020
It's the minimum of sort of our
energy over our other energy.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:51.470
I just think, well this is
something you should see.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.020
This is a quotient here.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.880
It's got a name called
the Rayleigh quotient.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.230
And it would appear in the book.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.350
So really, I guess
what I'm doing

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.170
is calling your attention to
something that's in the book.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.340
That this a ratio of x
transpose K x to x transpose M

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:19.560
x, if I look over all
vectors x, the lowest one

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.870
is the eigenvector.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.590
The best x is the
eigenvector and the ratio

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.410
is the eigenvalue.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.350
This is like my point that I
wanted to mention the Rayleigh

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:31.150
quotient.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.340
Here it is in the
matrix case, and there

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.080
would be similar
Rayleigh quotient

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.490
in the continuous case.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.200
I'll just leave it at that.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.070
That in describing
eigenvalues, we can talk about

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.070
Kx=lambda*M*x, like this.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.980
Or we can get energy into it.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.870
And you remember the whole
point about finite elements

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.500
is, look at the energy.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.470
Look at that the quadratics.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:04.980
Multiply things by things.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.150
It came from the
weak form, it didn't

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.220
come from the strong form.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.370
In the differential
equation here, we just

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.280
have single terms.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.870
We got to these things
through that process

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:23.460
of multiplying by
u's and integrating.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.090
That's what gave
us these products

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:29.790
and it works also
in the matrix case.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.420
OK, that was a lot
of speech-making

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:41.970
about topics that we simply
didn't have time for in class.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.050
I'm ready for any
question, or I'm

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:48.210
ready to maybe do a Fourier
example, would you like that?

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.890
Because this is
where we really are.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.660
I'll even take one that
will be on the homework.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:01.510
Just so you'll have a start.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:10.780
OK, let me take a square
pulse, yeah this is a good one,

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.330
I think.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.320
In Section 4.1, there's a
question for the Fourier series

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.970
of a square pulse.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.900
OK, so what does the
square pulse look like?

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.090
Here's minus pi to pi.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.170
Here's zero.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.060
The square pulse
goes along here, up,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.360
square pulse, and down.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:48.120
Actually, let me go to L/2,
oh I'll just call it h.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:56.450
Let me find the Fourier
series for this function.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.160
It goes along at
0, it jumps up to 1

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.010
over a interval of length
2h, going from minus h to h,

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.410
and then back down to
0 and then repeats.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.810
So bip bip bip, square pulse.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.200
So that's my function.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.860
Is that function odd,
or even, or neither one?

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.620
It's even, so I
can call that C(x).

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:27.480
And figure that I'm going to
use cosines for that one, right?

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.590
So tell me a formula for
the coefficients, what's

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.890
the integral that I have to do?

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:39.210
So my C(x) is going
to be some a_0,

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:45.170
we have to think what's a_0,
then a_1*cos(x), a_2*cos,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.540
and so on.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.700
So on.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.220
a_k*cos(kx).

00:40:52.950 --> 00:41:01.090
OK, what's the formula for a_k?

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:04.380
Before I plug in that function
I would like to get the formula.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.350
So I'm looking for the formula.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:10.110
It's a formula to remember.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.912
So I'm not wasting your time.

00:41:11.912 --> 00:41:14.120
Because you're going to see
it on the board and it'll

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.580
just take a mental
photograph of it.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.420
What do you think
it's going to be?

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.170
How am I going to get it?

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:26.670
I'll multiply both sides of
the equation by cos(kx), right?

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.600
And I'll integrate.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.440
So and then when I integrate,
the cosines are orthogonal.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.970
Just like the
sines this morning.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.030
All those terms will go,
except for this term.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.750
When I multiply this by cos(kx),
I'll have cos(kx) squared.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.250
Here I'll have a
cos(kx), and here I'll

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:50.800
have a whole lot of cos(kx)'s
but when I integrate,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.150
all this stuff is
going to disappear.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.870
And this will all disappear.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:58.970
This is it.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:04.070
So a_k is going to be the
integral of my function,

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.740
times cos(kx) dx.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.010
Divided by what?

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:14.170
Divided by the integral
of cos(kx) squared.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:18.130
Because I haven't
normalized things.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.620
So I don't know that that's
one, and in fact it isn't one.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.040
So I have to remember
to put that number in.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.030
OK, so that's the
formula and that number

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:32.310
turns out to be pi, again.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.830
If I'm integrating
from minus pi to pi,

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.150
then the average value of
the cosine squared is a 1/2,

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:44.450
it's sort of as much above
1/2 as it is below 1/2,

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:51.500
and so the average is 1/2,
the interval is 2pi, so pi.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.940
OK, that's the formula.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.600
Please just take a
mental photograph.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.740
Catch that one.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:05.990
Alright, now I've got
my particular C(x),

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.340
my square wave, square pulse.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.760
Very, very important.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.160
Very important
Fourier series here.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.210
Famous one.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.250
OK, so what do I have?

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:24.560
From minus pi to pi,
so what's my integral?

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.370
Well, my integral really
doesn't go from minus pi to pi

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.430
because my function
is mostly zero.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.330
Where does my integral go?

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.950
Negative h to h, right?

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.840
And in that region,
what is C(x)?

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.320
One.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.960
So you see it's
going to be nice.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.180
From negative h to
h, where this is one,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.630
I just have to integrate
cos(kx), so what do I get?

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:01.930
sin(kx), over k, and a pi.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:06.490
So you see again that that k is
showing up in the denominator,

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:13.650
and that's going to give me
the typical decay rate of 1/k

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:20.110
for functions with steps.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.480
For step functions.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:28.960
And now I have to evaluate
this between minus pi and pi.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.200
And-- No, h.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.090
Better be h.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.090
I mean, minus h and h.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.830
So what do I get for that?

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.140
I get sin(kh), right?

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:48.520
At the top, and what
do I get at minus?

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:54.930
So I now I want to subtract,
what is the sine of minus kh?

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.360
It's negative, right?

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:04.070
So as I expect with an
even function like cosine,

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:08.700
am I just getting twice?

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.930
I could take it from 0 to
h, and it would give me

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.490
one of them and the other one.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.500
Yep, I think so,
and divide by k*pi.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.480
So those are the
Fourier coefficients.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.060
Except for a_0.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.090
a_0 has a slightly
different formula,

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:34.850
because for a_0, why
is a_0 different?

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:39.170
How do you come up with
a_0, and what's its meaning?

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:44.940
a_0 has a nice meaning,
so this is worth

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.900
having come this afternoon for.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.900
a_0 will be what?

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.610
Well, I could get
it the same way.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.110
What will I multiply
both sides by?

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.200
If I want to pick off a_0?

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.810
Just one.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:06.530
It's not a cosine, it's
the cos(0x), it's the one.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.460
And then I integrate.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.350
I'm just going to
get the integral

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:15.970
from minus pi to
pi of C(x) times

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.796
one, divided by the
integral from minus pi

00:46:19.796 --> 00:46:31.190
to pi of one times one. dx.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.190
Same method.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:39.170
Multiply both sides by one,
which was the very first

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.660
of my orthogonal functions.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.250
Integrate it, all the other
integrals went away, right?

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:48.900
The integral of cosine
over a whole interval.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.000
It's periodic.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.630
You get the same
at the two ends,

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.620
so the difference is zero.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.230
So we just, the only term
left was the constant.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:03.060
And now what is the integral,
what's the denominator now?

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.490
That was the little,
slight twist.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.780
2pi.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.910
The denominator's 2pi.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.630
Yeah.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:15.490
That's that's why it's not,
yeah, it's slightly irregular,

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:18.010
I have to divide by 2pi.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:21.540
And now, what word would
you use to describe,

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.180
if I have a function,
and integrate it,

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:30.050
and I divide by the
length, what am I getting?

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:35.710
There's an English word that
would describe what this is.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.780
Average.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:44.880
This is the average.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.530
And it has to be.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.490
This constant term is
always the average.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.060
And what will it be for this?

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:59.130
So this was a_k, and
what is a_0, then?

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.430
So you can now tell
me, so everybody's

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:05.090
remembering this formula,
you integrate the function

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.980
and divide by the 2pi.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.070
Now we've got a
particular function,

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.220
so what is the integral
of that function?

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:16.210
So what does this equal?

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.180
For this particular C(x)?

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:22.210
What's the area under
that function C(x)?

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.780
2h.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.040
Right?

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.070
So 2h/(2pi), cancel the twos.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:34.060
So there's a constant
term, a_0 is h/pi

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:42.130
and the cosine terms
are-- yeah, actually

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.680
we're going to get
something nice.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.610
A really nice way
to complete this

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:55.220
will be if I put this together,
put this series together.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:05.960
So now I'm saying that this
square pulse is that constant

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:12.820
term h/pi plus
the next term a_1,

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.990
you can see all these
terms have 2/pi's.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:20.660
I'm a little surprised
that h over-- Yeah, no, I

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.710
guess it's right.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:29.170
2/pi, yeah, right?

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:33.700
So I've got sin(h), I think.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.380
And now I'm just copying this.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:47.030
2/pi*sin(h), sin(h),
is that what I want?

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.500
Over one.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.810
That's the coefficient
of sine, of cos(x).

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.550
a_1 was the
coefficient of cos(1x).

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:06.160
And then a_2 is the
coefficient of cos(2x).

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.870
So that will be
sin(2h). k is two,

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.770
so I have a two
down here, cos(2x).

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:20.470
And so on.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.840
Yeah, I think that's
the Fourier series.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:33.240
That would be the Fourier
series for the square pulse.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.350
Yeah.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:38.200
That would be the Fourier
series for the square pulse.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.470
Could I test any
interesting cases?

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:45.350
Suppose h is all
the way out to pi.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.990
Suppose I take that case.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:55.190
Let h go all the way out to
pi, then what's my function?

00:50:55.190 --> 00:51:01.080
If h=pi, then what
have I got a graph of?

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.160
Just one.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.530
It's just a one.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:07.110
If h is pi, what happens?

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:11.760
That becomes a one, and what
about these other things?

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.030
What is this thing when h is pi?

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.620
Zero.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.470
All the other terms go away.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.230
It's just a sin(2pi)
that would go away.

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:27.470
Yeah, so if h is pi, if I go out
to the place where I don't have

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:33.200
any jumps at all because it's
now all the way out there,

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.410
then these terms all disappear
and I just have this.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.960
And I would like
to ask you and it's

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:47.850
going to come up on Friday too,
what happens if h goes to zero?

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:50.570
Well, let me just
take h going to zero.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:52.140
What happens to
this whole thing?

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.920
What happens to my
function as h goes to zero?

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.890
Goes to zero, right, we've
squeezed it to nothing.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:04.780
And if h is zero then
sin(h) is zero, I get 0=0,

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.780
that's not interesting
enough to mention on Friday.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.960
But there is one case
that is important.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.600
Suppose I make the height, yeah.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.600
Make a guess.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:27.680
Suppose I make the height higher
as I make the base smaller.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.410
I'm going to keep
the area as one,

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:33.640
so if this has a base of 2h,
I'm going to have a height

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:39.070
of 1/(2h), So if I
keep the area at one,

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:43.910
so the height now is 1/(2h),
so now my square pulse,

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:46.430
I've divided it by 2h.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.980
I have a 1/(2h)
multiplying everything.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:56.820
And now if I let h go to zero,
something more interesting

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:58.320
will happen.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.570
And what?

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:05.370
Just tell me first, what
would you expect to happen?

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:05.980
Delta.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.310
Right, delta.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:12.500
So what I'll see show up
will be the Fourier series

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.180
for the delta function.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:22.300
When I divide by 2h,
so I have sin(h)'s over

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:27.840
h's, and of course what's the
great fact about sin(h)/h?

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:33.440
As h goes to zero,
it goes to, everybody

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.170
know what, that's the big deal.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.880
Yeah.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:43.030
One. sin(h) is the same size
as h for a very small h,

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:44.780
and approaches one.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:49.380
Yeah so we'll see the
delta function Friday.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.470
OK, so you've got a
sort of mini-lecture

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.410
instead of a real chance
to ask about homework.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:58.090
Next Wednesday
should be different

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:01.010
because there will be
Fourier series homework,

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:05.570
and I'll be ready to
answer questions about it.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.340
OK, thanks.

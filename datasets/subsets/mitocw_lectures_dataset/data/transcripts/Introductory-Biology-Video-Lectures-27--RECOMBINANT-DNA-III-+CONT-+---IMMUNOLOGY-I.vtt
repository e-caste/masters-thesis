00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There was a little confusion with
dideoxies in one sense,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and some of these things like the
PCR you're going to have to sort of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
sit down and actually think about it,
but the principle of the dideoxies,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if we were making a chain of beads
that had a hook on one end and a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
little hole on the other,
and we were joining these things

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
together, we could make obviously,
a chain that went on.  And then we

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
could hook another one
in, and so on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And if we had a bunch of beads like
this every now and then we threw in

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a very small number that didn't have
the hook on the end,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
any time this particular chain were
elongating and we put on one of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
these things, the chain would stop
because you haven't got any where to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
join onto it.  You added dideoxy
into a polymerase reaction.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
A chain that gets the dideoxy
doesn't have anything to join in the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
end, and that will stop.
If we only added this,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the entire reaction would stop,
and everyone would come at the first

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
time a dideoxy got incorporated.
The trick is to put a little bit in.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So, a few of the molecules stop.
Everything keeps going.  The next

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
time a dideoxy gets incorporated,
the chain will stop there.  And out

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of this, you will generate a family
of polymers that are of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
different lengths.
Each one will terminate with a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
dideoxy nucleotide,
and if the dideoxy nucleotide we

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
used in that particular reaction was,
let's say, dideoxy ATP,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that means that an A was the last
nucleotide added to every one of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
those.  And we can separate these on
the basis of size.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And if I ran them out on a gel,
I'd see something like that.  And

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that would tell me that when that
polymerase was coming along,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that was the first time it saw an A.
A few stopped there, polymerized a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
few more.  Then it put in another A,
put in some other things, and so on.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And that by itself wouldn't tell us
the sequence.  But if I did that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
reaction four times in a row,
then I could tell.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In the old days,
they didn't used to use dyes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We just did P32 on it as a label,
and then you'd run the four

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
reactions side-by-side.
And this would be with dideoxy ATP.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You'd see a pattern like that, and
maybe with dideoxy TTP,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
you'd see something like this.
And when you got the rest of them,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you'd kind of end up working out
what the sequence was by looking

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
across the four lanes.
This business of using the dye is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
just one more step up in the
engineering side that enables the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
thing to be done automatically.
And it's pretty well explained in

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
your textbooks.
OK, PCR, someone was confused as to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
why we didn't just let the cell do
it.  Well, the cell does a great job,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but if you are a molecular biologist
trying to understand the basis of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
life or if you're a biological
engineer, and you want to produce

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
something, you need to get hold of a
particular piece of DNA.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Or, if you're a forensic
investigator, and you've got a tiny,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
tiny sample of human DNA, and you
want to know whose it is,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
you have to make more of it.
And, that's what PCR is all about.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So I'm going to switch just over to
the net for a minute.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I think this first site,
I just want to show you something,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
how somebody functions in a lab now
with all these genes out there.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And then, I'm going to show you a
little animation for PCR that will

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
help.  So, if you just go to Google
and type NCBI,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that's the National Center for
Biotechnology Information.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And, the Dolan Learning Center is a
center that Cold Spring Harbor

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Laboratory has set up to teach
people about DNA.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So let me just see here.
So, let's just go to, OK,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
let's use, whoops, this is going to
seize on us.  OK, let's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:43.000
find how it happens.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
OK, so here's this National Center
for Biotechnology Information.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
There's all sorts of things you can
search for, and I'm not expecting

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you to know the site.
I just want to sort of give you a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
demo.  If I was sitting in my office,
this is the sort of thing I can do

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
easily.  Rather than sequence
looking for DNA sequence,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I'm going to look for the translated
sequence of the protein that's

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
encoded by the gene where the
computer's gone through and used the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
genetic codes tell me the sequence
of a protein.  I told you about

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
sequencing a mismatch repair gene
back in the 80s.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It was called MutS,
and I'll put in Walker GC,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and probably hopefully get us to the
thing.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And there, the very first hit is DNA
repair.  Protein MutS salmonella

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
typhimurium, that's the one I
sequenced.  So I'll just go to that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It has various ways of displaying
the sequence.  I'm going to switch

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to Fasta, which is a very easy way
to see it.  Now what you see is the

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
sequence of the protein using a one
letter code, or one letter stands

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
for each amino acid.
K is lysine.  A is alanine,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and so on.  I'm just going to copy
that, that piece of sequence.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
OK so that's the bacterial gene for
mismatch repair.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
At the time I put that in the
database, there wasn't anything else

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
like it, except for the gene that
was Streptococcus pneumonia.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But I found out, someone else is
sequencing by phoning around in the

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
field.  I'm going to go back to the
main site and I'm going to use a

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
program called Blast,
which lets you search the entire

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
database.  I'll use a protein blast.
I'm going to take a protein

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
sequence, and I'm going to ask what
else is out there in terms

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
of protein sequences?
I'll paste in this bacterial

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
sequence, and then I'm going to,
if I can, manage this thing.  Let's

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
see if I can get myself down here.
OK, over here I'll probably do, OK,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000
so I'm going to limit it, let's just
search the human genome.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
That's all we've got to do.
And what did I have to do to get

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
this thing to fit?  Which button?
Go to the right.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Can you just come up here for a
second to help me get this set up?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I'm computer limited here
apparently.  OK,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that one, OK, great,
so why do we not try this again?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:51.000
PAUSE]
Sorry about this.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000
We'll see if we can get this thing
to go.  I have what?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Yeah, that's OK though.
That should be fine.  Try again.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Let's see if I can get the thing to
work.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
OK, so it's got it now.
It'll tell me.  It's searching all

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
the sequence that's out there.
There's just an unbelievable amount

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of sequence.  That's just how long
it took.  It's showing me here a

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
diagrammatic representation of the
things.  Then I can see that the

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
very first it was MutS homolog three
for humans.  And if I go down here,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
we can actually see on alignment of
the bacterial gene on the top line,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and the lines below is the sequence
of that particular human homolog.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And you can see in between all the
things that are in common,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and particularly down at the
C-terminus of the protein,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
you can see there's very strong
conservation.  You may not think

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that that's impressive,
but remember for every one of those

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
positions, there's 20 possibilities.
So, if you get that many in a row,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that's the same gene basically.
And when you take the structure,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the structure's going to be very,
very similar.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And it does mismatch repair in both.
Just to try and give you an idea of

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
how you do sequence now,
because with all these genomes done,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
you do the vast majority of it by
computer, rather than some other way.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I want to take you and show you
this.  DNA learning: if you go there,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
the second thing is a
set of animations.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Go to the animations.
There's one on polymerase chain

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
reaction.  And,
I'm going to just show you this

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because this is a nice little,
let's see if we can get this thing

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
to center.  OK we'll have to see
whether this is going to work.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
OK, so this is the principle of,
you can go do this at your leisure,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
but the idea is to heat the DNA up,
the strands come apart.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Then, were going to take these two
little primers,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
not promoters, which I think someone
was confused about,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
a little piece of DNA that
complimentary,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and anneal them.
Than we added DNA polymerase.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
You know what happens then.  We
extend those primers.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That was the first cycle.
Do the same thing again.  Go to the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
second cycle.  This is what I was
drawing on the board the other day.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now are going to denature the DNA.
The strands come apart.  Let's let

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the polymerase extend them.
Let's go to the third cycle,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
denature the DNA, anneal the primers,
extend the primers,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and now for the first time,
we've got what we were shooting for.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:35.000
We have a double-stranded copy of

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:45.000
just the DNA that was defined
between those primers.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000
OK, I think this actually,
I'm going to go back one.  Oops,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
OK.
If you go, then,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to the amplification graph,
what they're doing here is they're

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
showing you what happens as you do
successive cycles.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So, at the first, oh,
it's down here.  Just a minute.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
If we do the first cycle, we end up
with two DNA copies.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
That's just plotting what I showed
you.  The next one: we have four.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We haven't yet got to this target
sequence.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
By the next cycle,
we now have two copies of the target

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
sequence plus these other things.
But if you keep going, let's say by

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
the time we're at seven cycles,
the number of targets is up to 114.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The number of DNA copies is 128.
But, if we keep going like this,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
we'll find out that the target
copies become the vast majority of

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
the sequences that are in there.
So, by the time that you're up in

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the 30 cycles,
or something like that,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
there's only a handful of the
original things,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
or almost all, and that,
I hope will help some of you who

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
might have had problems with
understanding the PCR.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So, what I'm going to do is tell you
a few more things about what you can

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
do with recombinant DNA,
this recombinant DNA technology,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
because it's just so powerful.  And
I can only sort of give you a few

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
ideas, and show you a few variations.
But, most of these things are just

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
taking principles that you've
already learned as part of the basic

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
biology I'm trying to tell you,
and then using them like an engineer

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to achieve some applied purpose.
For example suppose I wanted to

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
produce a human protein,
and try and produce it in a

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
bacterium.  That would be great.
I could take the one gene.  I could

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
grow a fermenter load of E.
coli, and if I got it right,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
then I'd be able to make a lot of
this protein instead of trying to

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
isolate it from some human source or
something like that.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
There's a couple of problems.
We talked about them.  One is the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
problem of promoters.
Another one is that human DNA would

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
have introns in it.
And, bacteria doesn't recognize the

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
human promoters.
It wouldn't start to make an RNA in

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the right place,
and it doesn't know what to do about

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
splicing out the intron.
So, let's address the intron first.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
There is a way of handling that
that's quite easy.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And that's what's called to make
cDNA library.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So, if we have DNA,
and then we get the RNA,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000
we get the RNA copy [SOUND OFF/THEN
ON] including these intron sequences.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And then what happens,
this is RNA splicing that we talked

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
about.  And what we get out of that
would be an mRNA,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.000
in which the introns have been
removed.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So, eukaryotic cells,
my cells, know how to express the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
gene, so they make the RNA,
they know how to get rid of the

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
introns.  So, if I were to isolate a
messenger RNA.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
That's been spliced from me,
or you, or anything, what we would

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
have is a population of RNA
molecules that don't have

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000
introns anymore.
Anybody remember any way we could

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000
get from RNA back to DNA?
Reverse transcriptase.  So,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:28.000
if we used reverse transcriptase,
that protein that David Baltimore

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.000
discovered and viruses,
and which retroviruses use,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000
now we would have a signle stranded
DNA copy of the mRNA.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And then, we could use an ordinary
DNA polymerase to get ourselves to

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
double-stranded DNA.
We'd be doing, in essence,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
exactly what one of these
retroviruses does.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
This would give us what's known as a
cDNA library, where the genes don't

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
have introns anymore.
So, if I wanted to get at one of my

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
proteins, one of my genes,
and think about expressing it in E.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
coli, what I would do is go looking
in a cDNA library using a sort of

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
approach as we've done,
trying to find my gene of interest,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
because if I use the cDNA library
now it would just be like

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
a bacterial gene.
You could see the ATG start.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
You could get out your handy little
genetic code, and you could walk

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
along, and read out the sequence of
the protein.  So,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
that's part of what you need to do
if you wanted to make,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
say, a protein inside of a bacterium.
The other one which we talked about

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
was since the promoters are not a
universal language,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
what E. coli RNA polymerase sees is
different than what human RNA

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
polymerase sees as a start site.
I would have to add in a promoter

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
that would drive the expression of
this open reading frame if I wanted

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
it to work in E.
coli.  And that's fairly easily done,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
too.  A general thing that's for
this is called expression cloning.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And it would be more or less the
same idea.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
We'd have a vector that had a
cloning site.  It has an origin of

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
replication, and maybe there's a
selectable marker such as the drug

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
resistance.  That's the basic kind
of factor that I talked about before.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
However, if I clone in a piece of
DNA into that,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
it has to have a promoter that can
be read in the organism working with,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
because it's just out whatever
nature gave it,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
whatever promoter that would be in
front of that.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
But, if I were to now into this
vector put an E.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
coli promoter right there,
now, if I just downstream of that

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
put any open reading frame,
human protein lets say, which we've

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
gotten rid of the introns,
the human genes minus its introns,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
which you got from the cDNA library,
now when the bacterial polymerase

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
came along, it would be copying,
making it a messenger RNA for human

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
protein, and we could
get it out of that.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And the beauty of that,
suppose we took the front part of

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
the Lac operator,
we would have a regulated promoter.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
It would be just everything we
studied about Lac if we

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
were to starve it for,
you know, we have to get rid of

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
glucose, and then if we added
lactose or some kind of synthetic

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
inducer, we can turn the promoter on
and off.  So, you could grow an

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
entire fermenter load of bacteria
without expressing the gene.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And then, once you had the bacteria
all grown up, you could throw in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
something that would normally induce
the expression of the Lac

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
regulatory system.
And now, instead of making beta

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
galactosidase,
instead it would make the protein

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
that you are interested in,
you with me?  It's very pretty.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And in fact, so much of what you
can see in this is,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
these really basic studies,
since the Lac system was one of the

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
first to really be worked out in
detail, we use its parts.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And, there are many vectors around
now that have exactly that.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
They have the Lac promoter,
and you can turn things on and off

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
in a regulated way,
so not only provide a promoter that

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
works in the organism,
but it also gives you a measure of

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:19.000
control.  There's another very cute
trick, and what we've done sort of

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
here is we took,
say, the promoter for Lac in the

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
regulatory region.
I'll use R to stand for regulatory

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
region, and then this would be the
LacZ sequence.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
What we've really done,
is we've taken a gene from somewhere

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
else, let's call it gene X that had
a promoter from gene X.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And, in essence, is cutting each of
them here.  And,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
now we take the regulatory promoter
region from Lac and we put down

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
below it gene X.
And, now we've got this gene whose

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
products we're interested in
producing in a fermenter under the

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
control of the Lac operon.
Well, there's another kind of thing

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
we can do.  We can do the other way
around.  We could take LacZ,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
which makes beta galactosidase.
We could put it under the promoter

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
regulatory region of gene X.
Well, what will happen then?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
If that construct is sitting in a
cell, anytime that the cell decides

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
to make gene X,
instead it will make beta

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
galactosidase, which is really
easy to assay for.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000
And, this sort of strategy,
you'd use something like LacZ as a

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000
reporter.
In this case beta galactosidase

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:11.000
synthesis, which you can assay for,
reports when is the promoter of gene

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:23.000
X is functioning.
This reporter gene now has the

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:34.000
regulatory characteristics that are
imposed upon it by that

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
particular promoter.
So, there's this picture that I've

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
showed you, this little movie I
showed you early on.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
You've seen it a couple of times.
In this case, the reporter is green

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
fluorescent protein.
What Barbara Meyer, who made this

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
particular construct,
did was they took the gene for green

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
florescent protein which started out
in a jellyfish as you may remember.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And, the protein folds up,
and ends up being fluorescent.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
So, we can tell when it's expressed
very easily.  And in this case,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
you'll notice not all of the genes
in the whole worm isn't glowing.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
And so, it's under the control of
the promoter regulatory region that

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
is expressed only in specific
body parts.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And so, you can see where that
promoter is working by just looking

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
at the worm.  In the case of
something like the mouse that we

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
talked about, it's a pretty uniform
expression at least in the skin.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
So, that was probably, in that case,
the green fluorescent protein was

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
probably put in a promoter that's
expressed in probably most of the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
cells in the body,
at least certainly all the ones in

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
the mouse cell.
I don't know the details of that.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Ditto over here.
It was probably something that was

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
expressed in most of the body cells,
but you also could have put

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
something that was just expressed in
some very little bits.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
So, depending on how you do the
construct, there are a lot of

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
different things that people can do
in this sort of thing.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
OK, one more category that comes
out of the sort of thing,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
is if we have a gene of some type,
I don't know what it does but I'd

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
like to find out.
You know, at least budding

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
geneticists, know what we'd like to
do.  We'd probably just like to

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
disable that gene very specifically,
and then look at the live organism

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
to see what happens.
And, the principle is the same

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
whether you're doing it in E.
coli or a mouse.  It gets a little

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
more complicated for technical
reasons doing it in a mouse.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
But the idea is exactly the same.
And here's the strategy.  So, we'll

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
just take a piece of DNA from the
organism.  And sitting at here is

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
this open reading frame that we've
seen.  We don't know what its

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
function is.  We think if I could
knock it out, get rid of its

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
function, I'll look at the organism.
Maybe I can make a guess then.  So,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
if we were to cut the gene somewhere
with a restriction site,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
and then we were to take,
for example, a gene encoding a drug

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
resistance or something like that,
and insert it at that point, what we

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
would end up with is this piece of
the organism's DNA.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000
The first part of gene X,
then a drug resistance, then the

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000
last part of gene X,
and some more sequence from the

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
organism.
Now, this would be,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
we'd have this in a test tube.
We could do it by the kind of

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
recombinant DNA manipulations that
we have.  And what would happen if I

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
were to put, now,
let's keep it with bacteria where

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
it's easy to see.
If I were to take that piece of DNA,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
put it inside a living cell,
what's going to happen?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Well, let's make this,
say, here's the end of it.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000
That's all we've got.  Well,
inside the living cell, we of course

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
have the entire genome.
And then we come to this part.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000
We have gene X.  Then we'd have
this going.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
That would be the whole thing.
Well, this particular piece doesn't

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
have an origin of replication.
It's not joined to a vector.  It's

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
just sitting there.
So, if the cell divides,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
it's not going to get replicated.
So, if I select for a drug

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
resistance that's on that piece of
DNA, unless something happens I'm

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
not going to get a drug-resistant
bacteria.  But you do know a way

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
that this thing could join to an
origin of replication.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
It could join to the origin of
replication that's on the bacteria

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
chromosome.  And,
the way to do it would be by

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
undergoing genetic recombination
over here, because this DNA is

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
exactly the same as on that side,
and over here it's the same thing.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
This DNA is the same as that side.
So, if that genetic exchange

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
happened, what would happen,
even if it happened rarely, was this

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
piece of DNA would replace the piece
of DNA that's in there.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I'd be able to tell it was there
because I'd just select for drug

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
resistance.  And even if it only
happened only one in 500,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
00 cells, it wouldn't matter because
up would growth the colony that now

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
has the drug in the middle of gene X.
Gene X is gone,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
and I could look at the organism if
it's alive and see if

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
it has a phenotype.
If it's an essential gene,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
that strategy obviously won't work,
and when people do the more

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
complicated thing of doing this kind
of experiment to make a transgenic

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
mouse, it takes about a year to go
from our DNA manipulation all the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
way to the live mouse with a
disrupted gene.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And sometimes what they find after
spending half of your PhD.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
is that that was an essential gene.
And, there's no live mouse, or it

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
made it two days into being an
embryo and it tanked at that point.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
But, this again,
you could see, we talked about going

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
back and forth between gene,
protein, and trying to figure out

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
function.  All I can sort of do is
give you the flavor of what's going

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
on.  But one sort of overarching
thing I hope you remember going

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
through this is DNA sequencing,
PCR, all these kinds of

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
manipulations we're talking about
are just exploiting these basic

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
cellular components that we learned
about studying, how does

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
DNA replicate?
How is information coded?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
How do genes get expressed?
How does genetic information gets

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
sorted between cells?
It's simply applying those

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
relatively well understood tools,
or sort of biological principles and

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
parts that we learned about,
and now using them as tools in an

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
engineering way,
and have just completely transformed

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
the way biology has been done in the
last couple decades.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And it's just,
as I say, things are changing so,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
so fast.  It's almost breathtaking.
So, the last little bit of sort of

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.000
technique oriented stuff,
I just want to at least make sure

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I've mentioned what are called
microarrays.  You often hear these

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
referred to as DNA chips.
The principle here is this is a way

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
that lets you ask,
not only whether one gene is being

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
expressed or not under a particular
condition, whether its RNA is being

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
made, and in most cases that means
making protein,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
or whether it's off,
or whether it's at some intermediate

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
level.  A microarray lets you do
that experiment with many,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
many, many genes at once.  And
here's the principle.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:11.000
You take some surface,
and there will be a bunch of,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000
if you will, sites on the surface,
on this chip or whatever.  And, what

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
will go to be attached here would be
a little piece of DNA

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:39.000
from gene one.
I mean, let's say,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000
maybe a hundred nucleotides: that
would be far more than enough to

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000
make it absolutely specific that
they could only hybridize to a

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000
messenger RNA from gene one,
and not from anything else.  And,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
this one, then, would have from gene
two, this one, from gene

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000
three, and so on.
Then, if we were to take a messenger

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:32.000
RNA preparation from,
say, an organism if it's a little

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
one, or maybe a tissue,
or something like that, anywhere you

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
could isolate RNA from.
And then, we'll label it in some

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
kind of way, and we can label it
radioactivity,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
we can label it with dyes.
It's usually done with dyes,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
and there are a variety of
variations on this.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Those are sort of technical details
how to do it.  But here's

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
the principle.
Let's just, for the moment,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
just consider that it's got a label
on it.  So if we take the messenger

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
RNA, and take this little chip that
has samples in the extreme,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
it could be a sample of every single
gene that's in the genome of that

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
organism, we take this labeled RNA,
actually what we would usually do is

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
to use this to make a labeled cDNA
preparation, which would be a copy

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
of each one of these things.
That the technically easy way to get

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
label into it.
But what we do have is if the gene

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
was on, its messenger RNA would be
on, and we'd have a bunch of stuff

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
corresponding to gene one that had
label on it.  And if we give it a

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
chance, that will,
then, hybridize here.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And there would be some way of
detecting this label.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
If gene two was off in that sample,
there won't be any hybridization.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
There won't be any signal.
You can sort of see in principle

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
what you're doing is you're
interrogating each gene in the

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
extreme, each gene in the organism
under some condition.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Is it on?  Is it off?
If you did various samples,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and you could see maybe it's in an
intermediate level, and so on.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
So, the chips look like that,
50-100,000 genes perhaps, something

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
like that.  These things are really
small.  Here's sort of a display of

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
a simple one, and this is one where
they're taking RNA.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
The samples are from two conditions.
One's labeled with a dye that's

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
green, and one's labeled with a dye
that's red.  And,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
if you get equal amounts,
it looks yellow.  So, they mix the

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
two things together,
and if the gene is the same under

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
two conditions it would be yellow.
Under one condition,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
if the gene was on in condition one
than it would be green,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
and off in two, and back and forth.
So, without trying to get lost in

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
the technical details right now,
which doesn't matter, the principle

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
of this thing is that you can take,
you can sort of, by making a

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
preparation of RNA,
then you can use these DNA chips and

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
say, is each gene on and off?
Or if I switch conditions, who

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
comes on and off?
So, it's a little like,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I think of it this way.  It's like
having, all right,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
who's on today?  And a number of
hands go up, or something.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And the rest of you would be off.
But, come back on Monday, and I say

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
to the something or other,
and a different set of you would put

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
up hands.  And what I'm kind of
looking at are the changes between

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
that.  And the sort of thing where
this has been so powerful,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
for example, is there are kind of
cancers for which there is a

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
treatment, but it was
only 20% successful.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And, when people started to study
these cancers and then looked to see

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
what genes were on,
what they realized was even though

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
physicians had given these cancers a
particular name,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
if you looked at which genes were
being expressed,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
they fell into two classes,
class A and class B.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And what they then realized was that
the treatment they were using was

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
100% effective of tumors of class A,
and wasn't doing anything for the

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:51.000
tumors of class B.
The physician couldn't tell the

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:00.000
difference between these two types
of tumors, but a microarray can

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So, again we have so little time in
this class.  I could go on basically

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
for ages.  There's the output of the
real sort of DNA chip.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
You can see things are very dense,
and the great cleverness in doing

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
these things, people now use the
technology that goes with LaserJet

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
printers to actually synthesize
little pieces of either DNA or

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
proteins starting on a little spot
on each membrane, or on

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
the chip, or whatever.
You put it on one nucleotide and

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
then you put it on the next,
and the next, and the next.  You

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
could sequence it using technology
that's already around for inkjet

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
printers at that kind of thing.
So here you've seen a fusion of

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
different types of engineering.
OK, the last thing I'm going to

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
tell you about is a little bit about
the immune system.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
We've run into this.
This is a movie that some of you

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
liked, got the biggest aw I think of
the last part of the course anyway.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
But what we are seeing here is a
white blood cell pushing aside from

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
red blood cells,
which are stationary,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
and chasing a bacterium.
It's obvious that it can trace it.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
It's able to recognize some things,
and at some point, then, it took it

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
up.  The principle of what happened
there was this white blood cell had

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
a capacity to recognize the bacteria,
then bind to it.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And then, its membrane,
this is the membrane, and this is a

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000
white blood cell.
There's many types of these,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
and it pinches the membrane off.
So you have the bacterium.  This is

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
the bacterium.
And, it's inside a little membrane

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
compartment, as if the bacteria is
in a little soap bubble.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
And the principle of what happens
is the white blood cell has another

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
soap bubble that's full of poison.
And, if you took two soap bubbles

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
and push them together,
you know what happens.  They'll fuse,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
and you'll get a bigger soap bubble.
And that's, in essence, how these

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
white blood cells normally kill
bacteria.  They would bring together

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
these two compartments.
Now you have a bacteria and a poison

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
within a white blood cell at the
bacterium, would get killed.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
And we talked about how bacteria
fought back.  That was a

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
streptococcus that has a capsule.
And the capsule, by having

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
polysaccharide on the outside,
prevent the white blood cell from

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
being able to grab hold of some
feature of the bacteria,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000
that starts this process of killing
it.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
And when I told you the story of how
DNA was found,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
it was people studying pneumonia.
If you remember, it was

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
streptococcus.
If the streptococcus had a capsule,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
and the people would get very sick.
And after five or six days,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
there would be a crisis where they
either lived, or they died.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And what would happen in that time
is that, the last thing I'll tell

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
you about, what's called the
adaptive immune system would have

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
generated special recognition
molecules called antibodies that

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
would have learns to recognize the
capsule at that bacterium.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And once those were there,
now those white blood cells would be

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
able to capture the bacterium,
because the antibodies give it a

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
hand in recognizing there was
something there that needed

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
to be killed.
The way this adaptive immune system

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
works, it's almost like science
fiction.  And I'll tell you the

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
molecular basis of it.
The key insight came from Susumu

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Tonegawa, another member of the MIT
faculty biology,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
and also runs Picower Center,
who got a Nobel Prize for

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
understanding the basis of the
diversity of the immune system.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
What I just want to do for the
moment is just sort of point out the

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
key features of what's called the
adaptive immune system.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And this is one of the reasons that
we are able to live.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And even though we get sick from
time to time, and we've all had one

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
thing or another get us for a little
while during the semester,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
the reason we aren't sick all the
time, and the reason we recover when

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
we get sick, as we have what's
called an adaptive immune system.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
What happens when people get
infected with HIV virus is the cells

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
that it lives in and destroys are
key players in your adaptive immune

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
system.  And to some people don't
die from the H1V infection itself,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
they died because lots of things
that we just, bacteria or fungi,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
whatever things we just have on us
and we live with all the time

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
suddenly become killers because you
lack the immune system

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
that fights them off.
So the so-called adaptive immune

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.000
system is absolutely amazing.
So several features, it's got an

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.000
incredible diversity,
there is a general word that's used

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:03.000
to describe some sort of all sorts
of chemical entities, and

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
it's called an antigen.
So anyway, this can recognize many,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
many what are called antigens.  And
at the moment I think you can just

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
think of them as some kind of
chemical entity.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
It could be a carbohydrate.
It could be a little piece of an

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
organic molecule.
It could be a few amino acids on a

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
protein.  But it's something that's
potentially capable of being

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
recognized by your immune system.
So, there are many,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
many, many things.  And the amazing
thing is I can go into a lab and

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
synthesize a molecule that's never
been seen on this Earth before and

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
challenge somebody with it,
and you'll produce an immune

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
response that will be mounted
against that even though it's never

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
been on Earth before.
It's also the specificity.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
It is completely amazing.
If I were to take a protein,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000
and then, let's say, put on a phenyl
ring with a methyl there,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
inject it into someone, the immune
system would figure out how to

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000
recognize this thing with the phenyl
ring, and the methyl.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
But, the response it generated,
it would see this but not, let's say,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
that if I wanted to get an immune
system, something with methyl here,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I'd have to put that into the
organism and let the immune system

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
figure out a response.
So, the specificity is at the same

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000
kind of level that you are used to
here.  If restriction enzymes can

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
read different sequences in DNA or
protein can tell one optical isomer

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
of a small molecule from another,
it's this fitting of complementary

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
shapes.
So, with the immune system is all

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
about is figuring out how to get a
complementary shape somehow that's

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
able to recognize essentially any
kind of chemical shape and structure

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
you can think of.
It's just mind blowing.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And, you could already see right
from the beginning,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
where the fundamental problem people
could see from the beginning.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
It sounds like we would need a
genome that's infinitely big,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
full of things that are ready to
recognize anything.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And so, one of the real surprises
is, and now we know,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
is there is 20,000 genes are so in
the human genome.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
There can't possibly be a zillion
genes, each one specific for one of

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
these structures.
There had to be some underlying

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
principle that we had to learn.
And that was one of the big

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
challenges in the immune system for
a long time.  Another one was that

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
if you have an organism that has
this capacity,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
and you could recognize it,
why don't you do yourself in?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Because you yourself are full of
entities that could,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
in principle, generate an immune
system.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
So, one of the other things the
immune system had to deal with was

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
avoiding self recognition.
If you're able to recognize

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.000
anything, how do I not avoid killing
my own selves?

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
So, that is another really
fundamental problem in this immune

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
system.  This is exciting.
We can all stop and watch,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
but I think I'll just try and keep
soldiering along for the last minute

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
or so.  So, one other feature that
was interesting about the immune

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
system, is it has a memory.
And I'll tell you more about

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
antibodies at the beginning of next
lecture.  But,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
these are the kinds of molecule
that's able to recognize these

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
different entities.
And you've all heard the term in

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
your ordinary life.
But, if we look at the level of

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
antibodies that are
made in the body,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:48.000
if the first exposure to an antigen
that would get some kind of response

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:57.000
that comes up upon the first
exposure, and this is time here.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
If we let there be some delay,
it could be even into years, and

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
then we get a second exposure,
the antigen, the response is much

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
higher.  And this could be a log
scale.  So, it could be dramatically

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
higher.  So, what was the basis of
that?  How does it work?

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
You see right there the principle
of vaccination in the sense that if

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
you ever got chickenpox as a kid,
your body has learned how to make

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
antibodies.
So if you ever see it again,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
it mounts a really big immune
response.  If you want to have a

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
disease something like tetanus that
you haven't seen,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
you go to the doctor and they squirt
and a bit of the stuff that doesn't

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
make you sick,
but it gives you the initial immune

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
response.  Then,
if you ever step on a rusty nail,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000
you get a very powerful response
against tetanus.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
And that sort of the underlying
principle of vaccination is this

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000
concept of memory.
We'll pick that up on Wednesday.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
So, have a great Patriots Day
weekend.

00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:21.160
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.650
So what we are talking about
is actually matrix elements.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.060
If you want to do anything
interesting in atomic physics,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.990
you have to copy or induce
transitions from one state

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.900
to another state.

00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:45.495
Well, maybe that should be Hab.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.370
For many phenomenon,
which we will

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.740
cover throughout the
rest of this semester,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.400
spontaneous
emission, coherences,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.850
and three-level instances, and
super radiance, all we need

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.880
is a matrix element.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.690
And this matrix
element will just

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.190
run through all the
equations, and be

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.230
responsible for a lot of
interesting phenomenon.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.890
And for most of the
description of those phenomena,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.280
we don't have to know where
this matrix element comes from.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.140
The only thing we
have to know, there

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.320
is a non-seeable matrix element
which drives the process.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760
And as you know,
the matrix element,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.640
with an external field, is
called the Rabi frequency.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.530
And a lot of physics just
depends on the Rabi frequency.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.320
But what is behind?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.730
The engine behind the Rabi
frequency is a matrix element.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.810
So in the unit I started to
teach the week before spring

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.140
break, we talked
about matrix elements.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.080
And for H, for the Hamiltonian,
we used the coupling of an atom

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.200
to the electromagnetic field.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.220
And then we calculated,
what is the matrix element

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.300
induced by the electric field?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.340
We made the dipole
approximation.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.650
And that's your plain, vanilla,
generic dipole operator

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.440
which can connect two states.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.460
But we also consider,
what happens

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.460
when we go beyond the
dipole approximation,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.380
and we found extra ways
of copying two states?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.800
For instance, we can
copy two states which

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.440
have the same parity with
a quadrupole transition,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.290
or we can couple them with a
magnetic dipole transition.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.090
So these are other ways to
get into matrix elements.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.680
For most of the
course, you don't

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.600
have to understand what
is behind the matrix,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.100
and you just know,
there is a number

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.430
which drives the process.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.260
So what I want to finish
today is to discuss--

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.210
and these are called selection
rules-- which tell us,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.410
when are those numbers,
when is this matrix element

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.384
which couples two
states, when is it zero,

00:02:59.384 --> 00:03:00.550
or when is it non-vanishing.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.690
And what is helpful
here is, well,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.070
as always in physics,
use symmetry.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.630
And if you have an
operator, let me give you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.880
examples immediately.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.470
But just think for a moment
about the electric dipole.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.350
The electric dipole is
the position operator R.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.970
And you want to know, can the
position operator R induce

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.690
a transition between two states.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.810
The way to analyse it is
now in terms of symmetry.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410
And for symmetry,
which is always

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.172
fulfilled for isolated
atoms, is angular momentum.

00:03:40.172 --> 00:03:42.130
Angular momentum is a
conserved quantum number,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.130
we have rotation symmetry.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.860
So therefore, we want to now
understand matrix elements

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.680
in the language of
rotation symmetry.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.833
And therefore, we don't want to
use a precision operator x, y,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.200
or z.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.220
x, y, z do not have
the rotation symmetry.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.890
We want to use linear
superpositions of x, y,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.950
and z-- I'll give you an example
in a moment-- in such a way

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.290
that the operator becomes
an element of aesthetic

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.830
of a spherical tensor.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.530
And spherical tensor, I
gave you the definition

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.450
in the last lecture, the
element of spherical tensor, Ln,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.520
is defined by-- well, I connect
it with something you know,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.150
that it transforms
on the rotation,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.750
like the spherical
harmonics, ylm.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.880
So it is pretty much for an
operator, what the ylm, what

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.870
the spherical harmonics
are for wave functions.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.770
I think I can do it more formal.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.350
And Professor Schwann
knows much more about it.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.690
I think these are elements of
the rotational symmetry group,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.900
But I don't want to go there.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:06.250
So what I mean by that is the
following, that if you take

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:16.130
the position vector r, you
can expand it into a basis,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.720
which is x and y.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:32.550
But if you use the spherical
basis, x plus/minus iy.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.525
Then what appears are
the spherical harmonics.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.620
So in that case,
it's rather simple.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.460
The position vector has
actually in this representation

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.880
components which
you can even see

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.290
are the spherical harmonics.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.510
And therefore, we transform
like the spherical harmonics.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.800
Or just to give you
another example, if you

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.110
have the operator, which is
responsible for the quadrupole

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.220
transition, well,
you get the gist,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.380
it's a product of
two coordinates.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.640
So therefore, it's a
spherical tensor of rank two.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.950
And it so happens,
but I'm not deriving

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:44.320
that, it is a superposition of
two components with Lm quantum

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.970
number, 2 plus 1, 2 minus 1.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.940
So that's how we
should think about it.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.960
So, we want to ask, we want
to extend the operator,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.010
into operators which
have rotational symmetry,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.170
and these are those, or
these are those three.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.860
So instead of using the
vector Cartesian coordinate,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.560
we use its spherical components.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:25.133
And with that, we can
take this expression

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:45.210
from the last
lecture, and rewrite

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:51.790
it using the Wigner-Eckart
theorem into a way which

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.090
allows us to immediately
formulate selection rules.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:03.600
So [INAUDIBLE] and primer
are the quantum numbers

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.330
of the state, except
for angular momentum,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.050
so matricing about principle
quantum number of the hydrogen

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.300
atom.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.970
And we want to copy from
a total angular momentum J

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.640
prime to total angular
momentum J. Actually,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:32.210
we want to copy from J prime,
M prime to a state, JM.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:41.230
And what the Wigner-Eckart
theorem tells us

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.440
that we can factor
out the M dependence.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.030
The M dependence just comes
from orientation in space.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.160
So M is just how you orient
wave functions and vectors

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.190
and space.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:58.680
And you can sort of write this
matrix element as a projection.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.356
And this is nothing else than
the familiar Clebsch-Gordan

00:09:03.356 --> 00:09:03.855
coefficient.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:13.930
And the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficient

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:22.240
for coupling the initial
state, JM, or to-- let me

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.740
put it this way-- to start with
the initial state J prime, M

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:33.680
prime, we have the L and
the M of our operator.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.280
And that should result
in a total angular

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.370
momentum of J and M.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.090
So we retrieve
again the formalism

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.935
of the addition of
two angular momenta.

00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:46.310
Sometimes, you
have two particles

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.554
you couple into angular
momentum and ask,

00:09:49.554 --> 00:09:50.970
what is the total
angular momentum

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.220
of the composite particles?

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.530
But what we do here for
this selection rule,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.230
we have the initial
state, we calculate

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.940
with the angular
momentum of the operator.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.030
You can think the
operator is a field which

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.720
can transfer angular momentum.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.420
And then, of course,
the final state

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.250
has to fulfill angular
momentum conservation.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.910
But one source of the
momentum is now the operator,

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.390
is the external
field, is the photon,

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.440
or the microwave drive,
whatever you apply.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:24.950
And yes, this
Wigner-Eckart theorem

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:36.170
allows us to write the matrix
element as a reduced matrix

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.670
element.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.130
Which really decides
whether the transition

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:50.940
is non-vanishing or not,
times a factor which is just

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.770
the orientation of the wave
function and of the operator

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:54.280
in space.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.360
So for the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficient,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.750
we have a simple selection rule.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:10.800
And this is that for
the [INAUDIBLE] number,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.020
the M of the final state has to
be the M of the initial state,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.520
plus a little M of the operator.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:28.180
And for both the Clebsch-Gordan
and the reduced matrix element,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.160
we have the triangle rule.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.620
Well, if you couple two
angular momentum vectors

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.220
to a final angular
momentum, the three vectors

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.640
have to form a triangle.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:48.290
And the triangle rule says that
some-- let me write it down,

00:11:48.290 --> 00:12:01.800
and then you recognize it-- that
the angular momentum construct

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.750
by the field has to fulfill
the triangle rule that J prime

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.920
and J can be connected.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.492
Yes?

00:12:08.492 --> 00:12:10.950
AUDIENCE: What is this symbolic
meaning of the double bars?

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.790
PROFESSOR: It's just
how, in many textbooks,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.760
the reduced matrix
element is written.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.180
It's nothing else
in a matrix element.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:29.260
But, you know, plus
the y that I looked

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.730
at in the quantum
mechanics book.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.570
But what happens is
these are not states.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.020
J and J prime are not states.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.390
They have an independence.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.390
So we've taken out
the independence.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:44.340
So this is sort of a matrix
element between a state which

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.890
may have been stripped
of its independence.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.830
So maybe, I don't know
if that's 100% correct,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.400
but if you have the
YLM in certain states,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.630
you have an e to
the IM and M part.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.550
And this has probably
been factored out.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.110
So these are not really states,
and the double line just

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.850
means it's a reduced matrix
element with the meaning I just

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.630
mentioned.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.680
It's a standard way of
factorizing matrix elements.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.470
And yeah, that means
reduced matrix elements.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:30.970
So in other words, when we
talk about selection rules,

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.760
we want to use
the representation

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.240
of spherical tensors, because
the spherical tensor, the rank

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.100
of the spherical
tensor, just tells us

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.974
how much angular momentum
is involved in the photon,

00:13:42.974 --> 00:13:44.265
is involved in this transition.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.990
So maybe just to
give you a question,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.390
so if I were to do a
multipole expansion,

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.980
and I have an octupole
transition, what is now

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.130
the angular momentum
transferred by a photon?

00:14:10.832 --> 00:14:12.097
STUDENT: 3?

00:14:12.097 --> 00:14:12.763
PROFESSOR: What?

00:14:12.763 --> 00:14:13.116
STUDENT: 3?

00:14:13.116 --> 00:14:13.616
STUDENT: 3?

00:14:13.616 --> 00:14:14.700
PROFESSOR: 3, yeah.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.470
The dipole is L equals 1.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.810
Quadrupole is spherical
tense of rank 2.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.440
L equals 2, so it's L equals 3.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.130
Now, can a photon transfer
three units of angular momentum?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.810
Can an atom get rid of
three units of, let's say,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.830
orbital or spin
angular momentum.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.820
We start in a state which
is J prime equals 3.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.330
You need one photon,
and you go to a state

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.190
which is J prime equals 0.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.450
Is that possible or not?

00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:57.790
We don't have
[INAUDIBLE], but do you

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.920
want to volunteer an answer?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.237
What's the angular
momentum of the photon?

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.180
PROFESSOR: Well, be careful.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.650
The photon has an
intrinsic angular momentum,

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.380
which is like the
spin of the photon.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.260
That's plus/minus 1.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.500
But just imagine that
you have an atom,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.040
and the photon is not
immediate at the origin.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.480
The photon is emitted a
little bit further out.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.500
Then, with reference
to the origin,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.200
the photon has orbital
angular momentum.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.960
And that's what
we're talking about.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.390
In the multipole expansion,
we fall in powers of x, and z,

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:43.080
and y of the spatial
coordinate of the electron.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.502
And that actually means we're
going away from the origin.

00:15:47.502 --> 00:15:50.160
And if you emit something
which is away from the origin,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.590
you have orbital
angular momentum.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.660
So, yes.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.680
An octupole transition
is exactly what I said.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.560
It means a photon is emitted,
and it changes the angular

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.982
momentum of the atom left
behind by three units.

00:16:04.982 --> 00:16:06.440
That's what we
really mean by that.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.273
And that's what we mean
by those electrodes.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.160
The question that
you should maybe

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.690
discuss after class
is, what happens

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.720
if you detect this photon?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.650
Is that now a
supercharged photon,

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.452
which has three units
of angular momentum?

00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:24.410
Is there something strange
in its polarization?

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.820
Think about it, and if
you don't find the answer,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.230
we can discuss it
in the next class.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.730
OK.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.120
So this is the classification.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.500
Let's just focus on
the simple examples.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.640
We have discussed electric
dipole and magnetic dipole

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.330
radiation.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.660
These are induced by vectors.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.810
Remember, E1 is
the dipole vector.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:07.425
For M1, the matrix element was
by the angular momentum vector.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.480
So

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.220
These are vectors.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.129
And that means
the representation

00:17:17.129 --> 00:17:20.130
of the spherical tensors,
or the quantum numbers

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.765
of the spherical tensors,
are the same of the Y1n.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.860
And so for dipole
radiation, whether it's

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.925
electric or magnetic, we have
now with the dipole selection

00:17:35.925 --> 00:17:40.540
rules, which pretty
much save you

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.590
at one unit of angular
momentum to state

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.130
B. Can you reach
state A with that?

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.600
And these selection rules are
that you can change the angular

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.900
momentum between initial
state by 0 and 1.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.280
This is the triangle rule.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.480
And delta m can be
0 and plus/minus 1,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.370
depending on polarization, which
we want to discuss in a moment.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:11.560
So in angular momentum,
electric and magnetic dipoles

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.380
have the same
selection rule, where

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.880
when it comes to the
question of parity,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.060
we've already discussed that.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:26.650
That an electric dipole connects
to a state of opposite parity,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.940
whereas, the magnetic
dipole connects

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.380
two states of the same parity.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.960
And of course, this comes about
because L is an axial vector,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.355
and R is a polar vector, which
have different symmetry when

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.730
you invert the
coordinate system.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.640
The one higher multipole port
transition, which we discussed,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.120
was the electric quadrupole, E2.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.480
And the spherical
tensor operators

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.250
for the quadrupole
transition, I gave you

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:07.300
already the example of, let's
say, xz, products of two

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:12.750
coordinates, because we went one
order higher than the dipole.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.700
They transform as Y2m.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:26.680
And therefore, we
have selection rules

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.700
for quadrupole transitions,
which tell us now

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.120
that we can change the total
angular momentum up to 2.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.310
And also, delta m can
change up to two units.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.170
And again, just to
emphasize, because people get

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.080
confused all the time.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.200
When we talk about a
quadrupole transition,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.010
we mean absolutely
positively a transition

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.747
where one photon is emitted.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.330
If you fully quantize
the field, there

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.880
is one creation
operator of the photon.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.960
It's one photon
which is created,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.555
and this photon carries
away the angular momentum

00:20:15.555 --> 00:20:16.430
we've just specified.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.650
Questions about that?

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.500
Let me conclude our
discussion of matrix elements

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.170
by talking about something
which is experimentally

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.720
very relevant.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.070
And this is how
selection rules depend

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.190
on the polarization of light.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.705
And I only want to discuss
it for electric dipole

00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:55.205
transitions.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:03.300
So when we wrote down
the coupling of the atom

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:14.700
to electromagnetic radiation,
we had the dipole operator,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.050
but we also had,
of course, the mode

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.520
of the electromagnetic
field, which

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.560
was characterized by a
polarization epsilon.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.090
So until now, when I talked
about selection rules,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.330
we discussed this part.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.670
But now we want to see how
it effects polarization.

00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:44.630
Well, the epsilon, for instance,
for circular polarization--

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.930
we'll talk about linear
polarization in a moment--

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.170
has this representation.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.810
So this is the unit
vector of the polarization

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.950
of the electric field when
it's circularly polarization.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:20.960
And now remember, we
take this vector r,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.550
and expand it in
the following way.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:29.620
So if you multiply now the
operator r, or the matrix

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.650
elements created by
this vectorate operator,

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:39.150
by the polarization, you see
that one circular polarization

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.260
checks out this component.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.559
The other circular
polarization projects this out.

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:45.100
And later, we'll talk about that
linear polarization projects

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.550
that out.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.250
So when we said that
we have matrix elements

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.050
for dipole transition,
which can change

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.680
angular momentum, or the
incremental number, by minus 1,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.610
plus 1, and 0,
this is now related

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.620
to the polarization
of the light,

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.640
either the photon
which is emitted,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.820
or when we use circularly
polarized light,

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.890
we can only drive this
transition, that or that,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.930
because the scale of
product of the polarization

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:21.150
vector and the matrix
element project out

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.560
only one component of
the spherical tensor.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.370
So if you look at
the expansion above,

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:42.380
we realize that the left- and
right-handed circular light

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.030
projects now out
the spherical tensor

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:51.530
operator, T1 plus minus 1.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.190
And since it's circularly
polarized light,

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.670
and therefore, we find
this election rule

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:08.280
that delta m, the Z component,
the Z component of the angular

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.550
momentum, changes
by plus/minus 1

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.725
when the circular polarized
light is sigma plus or sigma

00:24:14.725 --> 00:24:16.183
minus, right-handed
or left-handed.

00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:22.270
OK.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.311
So this is responsible
for circular polarization.

00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:29.310
These are selection rules for
circularly polarized light.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.952
Let me conclude by
discussing the case

00:24:31.952 --> 00:24:32.910
of linear polarization.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.040
Well, when we ask
linear polarization,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.460
if we ask for linear
polarization along x or y,

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:51.220
well, it's linear polarization,
but we should regard it

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:59.570
as the linear superposition
of sigma plus and sigma minus.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:04.200
So in other words, if you have
the quantization axis along z,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.980
and you use light which
is polarized along x or y,

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.600
the way how the light
talks to the atom

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.210
with symmetric operators
is that the light

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.550
is a superposition of
sigma plus and sigma minus.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:32.640
So what we have so far is,
so we had here the light key,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:42.715
the propagation of the
light was along the z-axis.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:57.040
But now, we want to look at
the other possibility that z,

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:05.300
or the quantization
axis, is parallel

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.320
to the polarization
of the electric field,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.910
which would mean that the
quantization axis is usually

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.090
defined by an external
magnetic field.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.930
If you're talking about the
situation that the electric

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.040
field of the electromagnetic
wave is parallel

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.962
to the magnetic field, then
with this polarization,

00:26:27.962 --> 00:26:34.150
we peak out this spherical
tensor component, which is z,

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.620
which is r times Y1,0.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.940
And that means that this
polarization of the light

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:52.070
induces a transition for
which delta m equals 0.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.790
And this is referred
to as pi light.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.280
So maybe if that got
confusing for you,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.960
let me just help
out with a drawing.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:14.260
We have our atom here, which is
quantized by a magnetic field

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:32.910
B. And if you shine light on
it, we have the electric field

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.120
perpendicular to
the magnetic field.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.290
So this would be x and y.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.790
And the natural way to describe
it is by using x plus/minus IY.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:51.400
And we have selection rules
where delta m is plus/minus 1.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:58.670
But alternatively, we
can also shine light

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.470
along this direction.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.860
And for the electric field,
which was perpendicular to B,

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.400
we retrieve the previous case.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.080
We have superpositions of the
sigma plus and sigma minus.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.790
But the new case now is that
the electric field is parallel

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:18.500
to B. And then, we
drive transitions,

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.300
which have delta M equals 0.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.760
So these are sigma plus and
sigma minus transitions.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.360
And this here is what is
called a pi transition.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.510
Anyway, it's a
little bit formal,

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:41.360
but I just wanted to
present it in this context.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.728
Questions?

00:28:48.728 --> 00:28:52.102
STUDENT: I have one slightly,
maybe, basic question.

00:28:52.102 --> 00:28:55.114
When we talk about polarization
in all these matrix elements--

00:28:55.114 --> 00:28:57.404
so for example,
photon [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:57.404 --> 00:29:02.390
right-- these are single
photons [INAUDIBLE] elements.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.573
And so when we talk
about shining a laser,

00:29:05.573 --> 00:29:06.555
it has a polarization.

00:29:06.555 --> 00:29:08.191
But we don't talk
about polarization

00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:09.992
for single photons.

00:29:09.992 --> 00:29:11.465
Or do we?

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.205
PROFESSOR: Actually, we
talk about-- the question

00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:18.413
is, what is the polarization?

00:29:18.413 --> 00:29:20.420
Do we talk about polarization
of single photons,

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.170
or polarization of laser beams?

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.020
Well, let me back
up and say, we talk

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.160
about polarization of a mode
of the electromagnetic field.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.820
We will always expand
the electromagnetic field

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.626
into modes.

00:29:34.626 --> 00:29:36.000
And the mode is
the polarization.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.600
It may happen that
at some point,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.050
a photon is emitting a
superposition of modes.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:45.990
But in the most
straightforward description,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.200
we always do a mode analysis.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.870
And often, we simplify
the case by saying

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.650
that the atom
interacts only with one

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.860
mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.960
And maybe in the case
of spontaneous emission,

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.170
we then sum over all modes.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.490
But for each mode, there's
a specific polarization.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.400
And it doesn't matter if this
mode is filled with one atom,

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.760
or with a laser beam, with
a classical electromagnetic

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.010
field, which corresponds
to zillions of photons.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.511
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
does it always

00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:18.010
end up being
electrical polarization

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.510
in this case, then?

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.010
Like because if
it's many photons,

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:28.010
then there's a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] for each of them,

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.107
or each of them
individually-- I don't know.

00:30:33.802 --> 00:30:34.885
PROFESSOR: No, it depends.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.650
If you have an atom, and it has
one unit of angular momentum,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.740
and it spontaneously
emits a photon,

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.380
if the photon is emitted
along the quantization axis,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.055
it can only be sigma plus.

00:30:53.055 --> 00:30:54.680
If it's emitted in
the other direction,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.770
it has to be sigma minus.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.710
Now if you go at strange
angles, then at this angle,

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.970
you overlay it with
different modes.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.100
And you may now find
photons in a superposition

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.934
of polarizations, because
we have several modes which

00:31:13.934 --> 00:31:15.850
are connected with this
direction of emission.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.180
I think if you write it
down, it's pretty clear.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.270
It's just sort of
projection operators.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:27.300
And for spontaneous emission,
we sum over all modes.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:38.610
But for me, I always think
about-- we can always

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:43.000
think about what a single
photon does by saying, well,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.060
if I'm getting confused
about a single photon,

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.250
let me figure out
what many, many, many

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.960
identical photons would be.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.490
And that would mean,
instead of a single photon

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.960
in a certain mode, I
release a beam in this mode.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.060
And then, suddenly, I
can think, classically,

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.970
I know what the
electric field is such.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.470
And then you go
back to the, what

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.178
is the electric field
of a single photon,

00:32:02.178 --> 00:32:03.940
and usually make the connection.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.010
So I think at least
for the discussion

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.660
of matrix elements,
transitions, angular momentum,

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.150
I don't think you ever have
to distinguish between what

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.940
single photons do and
what laser beams do.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.910
But there are important
aspects of single photons,

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:25.260
non-classical aspects, which
we'll discuss in a short while.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:25.995
Other questions?

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.250
OK.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:36.410
That's all I want to say
about selection rules.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:41.414
So with that now, we can
simply take the matrix element

00:32:41.414 --> 00:32:42.080
and run with it.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:53.820
So in this lecture
and on [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.347
I want to talk
about basic aspects

00:32:56.347 --> 00:32:57.430
of atom-light interaction.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:10.110
And what I want to
talk today about it

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.690
is the two important cases
when an atom interacts

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:20.970
with monochromatic
wave, or when it

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.370
interacts with a broad spectrum.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.490
In one case, when I
say monochromatic case,

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.550
you may just think of the
best laser money can buy.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.520
Very, very sharp.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.130
Very, very monochromatic.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.280
When I talk about
a broad spectrum,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.790
you may just think about
black-body radiation,

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.950
which is an ultra
broad spectrum.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.340
And they're two very
different cases.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.320
And some of it is just
related to Nancy's question,

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.920
that if you have
a broad spectrum,

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.610
we're always talking
about many, many modes,

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.600
and they will be
incoherent, and they

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.340
will be irreversible physics.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.110
Whereas for monochromatic
light, everything

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.810
is a pure, plain wave, and
everything is coherent.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.090
So we want to sort of
talk about that first.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.630
And then later this week,
I think on Wednesday,

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.880
we will talk about
spontaneous emission.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.739
But right now, we focus
on the simpler case,

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:18.489
where we drive the system with
electromagnetic radiation,

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:25.290
which is either
narrow-band or broadband.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.580
But let's just start
with a cartoon.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.650
We have an atom.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.230
And for that discussion,
all we need is two levels.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.900
And all we need is
that the two levels

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.600
are connected by
some matrix element.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.850
And the basic
phenomenological situation

00:34:52.850 --> 00:35:03.950
is that we have one atom,
which sits in a vacuum.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.350
So we have volume, V, of vacuum.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:22.370
And what is important
now is that the walls

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:27.920
of the imaginary boundary
of what defines our vacuum

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.200
is at low temperature.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:39.630
And low temperature means that
the atom will irreversibly

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.070
decay into the ground
state with a lifetime tau.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:08.200
And that means that
in some picture,

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:16.170
the excited state
is the broadening,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.320
which is broadened by
the natural lifetime.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.815
And in our discussion,
we assume--

00:36:25.815 --> 00:36:30.680
and this is what I said with
the cold walls of the vacuum--

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:40.950
that the energy
difference is much,

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.070
much larger than the
relevant temperature.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:53.910
And this is very well fulfilled
for our standard atomic system.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.230
The typical excitation
energy, even

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.510
for atoms with loosely bound
electrons, as the alkalis,

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.590
is two electron volt,
which corresponds

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:09.840
to a temperature
of 20,000 Kelvin.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.350
And even at the rather hot
temperature, definitely

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.340
hot temperatures, in The
Center for Ultracold Atoms,

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.970
but the KT at room
temperature corresponds

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.220
to 25 milli-electron volt.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:42.930
So therefore, when we
have an atom in isolation,

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.590
this is what we find.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.090
We find an atom which
will irreversibly decay

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.960
to the ground state.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.650
And the fact that
it irreversibly

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.830
decays to the ground
state is really

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.070
an inequality between energies.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.500
If you will talk about
a hyperfine transition

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.460
or something, there
may be a possibility

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.660
that we have an excited state,
which is thermally excited.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.030
But in the following discussion,
when we drive the atom,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.290
and when we look at
spontaneous decay,

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:17.330
we always assume that the
thermal energies are so small,

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:21.930
that we really assume an atom
sitting in a cold vacuum.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.480
Actually, it's your next
homework assignment,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.350
where you will
consider, what are

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.560
the effects of
black-body radiation.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.070
And you will actually
find out in your homework

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.440
that they are non-negligible.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.844
So yes, there are corrections.

00:38:35.844 --> 00:38:38.260
But you will also find out
that the corrections are rather

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.880
small, or it takes a long time
before black-body radiation

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.800
induces any
observable transition.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:48.940
OK.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.750
So I'll just try to be a
little bit formal here.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.420
Give you sort of a sketch
of an atom in a cold vacuum.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.700
Ground state is stable.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.920
Excited state,
irreversibly decays.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:08.950
And now, we want to bring
life into this situation.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.050
Now we add light.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.300
And the light-- and this
is now our discussion--

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.540
has a [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:31.375
And we want to
distinguish the cases

00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:36.580
of narrow-band and
broadband radiation.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:43.630
So it's clear that
if the bandwidth

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:50.496
of the light, the
only scale-- well,

00:39:50.496 --> 00:39:51.620
we have the scale of omega.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.260
But that's a huge scale.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.770
The only smaller scale,
which is given by the atom,

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.410
is the natural linewidth.

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:04.900
And depending, in
which case we are,

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:12.510
we talk about
narrow-band excitation

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.306
and broadband radiation.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:25.390
And once the linewidth is
much narrower than gamma,

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:29.270
we don't get any
new physics when

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.582
we assume perfectly
monochromatic light.

00:40:31.582 --> 00:40:33.290
So once we are much
smaller, we're really

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.430
discussing the case
of, well, we can

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.790
neglect the spectrum
broadening of the light source.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.270
Or in the other case, when
we have broadband light,

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.870
we can pretty much
make the assumption

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.020
that the light is
infinitely broad,

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.772
and what matters is only the
spectral density of the light.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:03.430
So in a pictorial
representation,

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:12.590
if this is the
frequency omega, we

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:22.900
have the atom with the
natural linewidth gamma.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:30.390
Narrow-band means we are
much sharper than that.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.200
And broadband means
really wide distribution.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:54.620
So if we have
broadband light, it

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.910
doesn't really matter
what the total power is.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.365
If the light is
very broad, there

00:41:58.365 --> 00:42:00.140
can be infinite
power in the wings,

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.000
but the atoms don't care.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.610
What matters when we
have broadband radiation

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.410
is the quantity called
the spectral density.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.130
And that's what we
need in the following.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.170
Which is, let me just
give you the units.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:29.400
Which is energy per volume
and frequency interval.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:38.030
So we can talk about the
spectral density as of omega.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:46.055
Or alternatively, when we
have a propagating beam,

00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:47.780
we don't want to
talk about energy,

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.550
we want to talk about intensity.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:43:01.490
So it is intensity per
unit frequency interval.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:08.200
Which would mean I of omega
is the energy density,

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.840
multiplied with
the speed of light.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:20.900
And that becomes energy
per area and time.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.090
So that's the flow of energy.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:35.660
But because we are
talking about board light,

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.270
it has to be normalized
by the frequency interval.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:50.200
In contrast,
monochromatic radiation,

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.460
it's sort of one
monochromatic electric field.

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:59.210
And we will specify it by
the single frequency, omega,

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.410
and the electric
field amplitude.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.810
Which when multiplied
by a matrix element

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:15.980
becomes the Rabi frequency.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:27.570
Or we can characterize the
light by the intensity I.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.010
But then it's an
intensity which has

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:32.570
the units of energy
per area time.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.050
It's not normalized to
any frequency interval,

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:37.445
because we have assumed that
the frequency interval is 0.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:54.700
So if you now have a description
how these two forms of light

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:59.020
interact with the
atom, at this point,

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.050
and we come to that
later this week,

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:07.330
we have to make an
assumption that we

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:12.670
are looking at
times which are much

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:16.120
smaller than the time
for spontaneous emission.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.440
So if you now, in a
perturbative sense,

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:25.070
expose the atom's monochromatic
or broadband radiation,

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.200
unless we have included
in the description

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.455
the many, many modes for
spontaneous emission,

00:45:30.455 --> 00:45:33.790
we are limiting ourselves
to a very short time.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.850
This is, you would say,
a severe description,

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.920
because atoms emit photons
after a short time.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.160
But we already capture,
without considering

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.100
spontaneous emission, a
lot of different physics.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.725
And we can nicely
distinguish between features

00:45:47.725 --> 00:45:50.825
of monochromatic and features
of broadband excitation.

00:46:03.816 --> 00:46:04.316
OK.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:14.990
So let's start out with the
case of-- give me a second.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.690
OK.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.180
So if you look at the two cases,
in the monochromatic case,

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.660
we will discuss the
idealized situation

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.870
of an atom interacting
only with a single mode.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:40.090
And what we will find out is,
we will find out that now,

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.370
in the optical domain,
we will find actually

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.830
equations for the
two-level system which

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:49.124
are identical to what
we discussed earlier

00:46:49.124 --> 00:46:50.540
when we discussed
spin [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.320
in a magnetic field.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.340
So in that sense,
a two level system,

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.600
driven by a laser system,
will behave identically

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.410
to a spin driven by
a magnetic field.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:04.180
Shouldn't come as a surprise,
but I will show that to you.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.730
But I can go over
that very quickly.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:11.630
The board-band
case will actually

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.910
follow from the
single mode case,

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.150
because what we
assume is broadband

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.810
means many, many modes.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.370
And then we do an averaging
over many single modes

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.440
by assuming random freeze.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.400
But I also want
to show it to you

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.550
because I picked
my verbs carefully.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.610
You have many, many
more things, but we

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:34.930
assume that there
is a random phase.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.940
When we talked about one
photon emitted into a angle--

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:43.170
it maybe responds to
a question earlier--

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.430
this photon may be in a
coherent superposition.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.260
This is not many modes
in a broadband wave.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.750
Many modes in
broadband wave means

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:54.060
that there is no correlation
whatsoever between the modes,

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.220
and all we will be
able to talk about is

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.360
an IMS value of
an electric field.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.830
But anyway, the result
is sort of predictable,

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.760
and I wanted to tell
you what I'm aiming for.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.340
But it's now really worthwhile
to go through those exercises

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:13.140
and look at what
happens in perturbation

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:23.749
theory for short times when we
have monochromatic radiation,

00:48:23.749 --> 00:48:25.290
and when we have
broadband radiation.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:41.780
So the first discussion
will show Rabi flopping.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.430
I don't know how
many times we have

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.080
looked at Rabi oscillation.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.810
But these are now
Rabi oscillations

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.130
between two electronic states
covered by a laser beam.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:53.980
And I want to show you
how this comes about.

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.295
And when I said strong
driving, well, we

00:48:56.295 --> 00:48:59.840
have only a limited time window
before spontaneous emission

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.520
happens.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.100
We have to discuss
the physics we

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.350
want to discuss in
this shot time window.

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:06.860
And if you want
to excite an atom,

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.390
and see Rabi oscillation
in a short time,

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:11.120
you better have a
strong laser beam.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:16.680
So this is why the monochromatic
excitation that we discussed

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.860
will pretty much automatically
be in this strong coupling

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.620
limit.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.200
OK.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.320
So what do we have?

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.220
We have a ground,and we
have an excited state.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.380
We have a matrix element.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.870
We know now where it comes from.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.875
And we have a monochromatic
time dependence.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.490
In perturbation
theory, we build up

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:51.480
time-dependent [INAUDIBLE]
amplitude in the excited

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.470
state, because we
couple the ground

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:59.000
state with the
off-diagonal matrix

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.910
element to the excited state.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:05.490
And we have to integrate
from the initial time

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.405
to the final time.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:18.190
We have the time dependence
of the electromagnetic field,

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.100
and we also need
the time dependence

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.220
of the excited state.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.780
So when I integrate
now over t prime,

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.410
I take out the ground
state amplitude,

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.250
because we're doing
perturbation theory,

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.730
and we assume that for
short times, needing order,

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:39.610
the ground state amplitude is
one, as prepared initially.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:49.430
So this in integral can
be solved analytically.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:11.790
Some of you may remember
that the minus 1

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:15.270
has something to do with the
lower bound of the integral.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:20.070
And when we discuss the easy
polarizability, we said,

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.760
this is a transient, and we
neglected it for good reasons.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.010
But now, we're really
interested in the time evolution

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.975
of the system, so now
we have to keep it.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:33.960
OK.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.750
We are interested in the
probability in the excited

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:37.520
state.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.880
So we take the above
expression and square it.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:59.080
And we find the well-known
result, with sine squared,

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.580
divided by omega minus omega eg.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:09.390
OK.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.540
So this is pretty much
just straightforward,

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.280
writing down an
analytic expression.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:23.690
But now, let's discuss it.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:31.310
For very short times, and this
is an important limiting case,

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:34.880
the probability in
the excited state

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.000
is proportionate
to times squared.

00:52:49.654 --> 00:52:50.570
And this is important.

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:54.650
We're not getting a rate
which is proportional to time.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.450
We're obtaining something
which is time square.

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.850
And the proportionality
to t square

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:03.070
means it's a fully
coherent process.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.132
So whenever somebody
asks you, you

00:53:10.132 --> 00:53:12.730
switch on a strong
coupling from a ground

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:15.830
to the excited state, what is
the probability in the excited

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:16.510
state?

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.210
It starts out quadratically.

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:22.790
The linear dependence-- famous
golden rule, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.460
or such-- only come later.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.090
This is a very
universal feature.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:33.440
And even if you use
broadened light,

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.870
for a time window,
delta T, which

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:43.720
is shorter than the inverse
bandwidth of the light,

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.620
talking about
Fourier's theory, you

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.480
don't have time
to even figure out

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.850
that your light is broad
and not monochromatic.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.590
For very short times,
the Fourier limit

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.010
does not allow
you to distinguish

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.950
whether the light is
broad or monochromatic.

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:58.640
So what I just derived for
you, an initial quadratic

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.580
dependence, is the
universal behavior

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.090
of a quantum system
at very short times.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.770
Because it simply says the
amplitude in the excited state

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:11.020
goes linearly in time, and
the probability, quadratic.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.540
OK.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.650
So this is for a
very short times.

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:34.670
But if you look at it
now for longer times,

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:38.960
we have actually-- we'll
see the atomic behavior,

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.610
and these are Rabi oscillations.

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:43.680
But there is one caveat.

00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:47.790
So we have derived.

00:54:54.370 --> 00:55:01.930
However, we have derived them
only perturbatively by assuming

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:04.390
that the ground state
has always a population

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:20.835
close to 100%, which
means we have assumed

00:55:20.835 --> 00:55:26.370
that the probability
in the excited state

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.470
is much smaller than 1.

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:30.120
Otherwise, we wouldn't
keep the ground state.

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:34.430
And this is only fulfilled
if you inspect the solution.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.810
The solution is
only self-consistent

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:39.590
if you have an off-resonant
case, where the Rabi

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:42.992
oscillation only comes from a
small fraction of the ground

00:55:42.992 --> 00:55:45.000
state population of
the excited state.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.270
Of course, you all know
that Rabi oscillations,

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:52.870
this formula, is also
varied on-resonance.

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.240
And you can have
full Rabi flopping.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:59.090
But I want to make a case
here, distinguish carefully

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:03.020
between monochromatic radiation
and broadband radiation.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.380
For that, I need for
perturbation theory.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.490
And therefore, I'm telling you
what perturbation theory gives

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.880
us at short times, and in
terms of Rabi oscillations.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.910
STUDENT: So you're
saying we assume

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:27.940
strong coupling with respect
to the atomic linewidth,

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:35.368
but weak coupling with respect
to the resonance, for instance,

00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:36.350
in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:39.822 --> 00:56:41.280
PROFESSOR: It's
simple, but subtle.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:41.780
Yes.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.980
So what we have is,
we assume we switch

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.760
on a monochromatic laser.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.900
Since we do not include
spontaneous emission, which

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.200
will actually damp out Rabi
oscillation-- we'll talk about

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.790
that later-- we
are only limited,

00:56:55.790 --> 00:57:00.020
we are limited here
to short times, which

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:04.160
are shorter than the
spontaneous decay.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.070
And now, I gave you
one universal thing.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.080
At very, very short times,
it's always quadratic.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.800
It's a coherent process.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.790
So that's one simple,
limiting, exact case

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.560
you should keep in your mind.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:20.680
But now the question is, if
you let the time go longer,

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.770
something will happen.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.290
And there are several options.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:28.610
One is, if times go longer,
spontaneous emission happens.

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:29.110
OK.

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:30.230
We are invalid.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:35.700
The other possibility is,
when time gets longer,

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:40.220
and we are on-resonance, we
deplete the ground state,

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:43.260
or [INAUDIBLE] perturbation
theory doesn't deal with that.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.940
But if we are off-resonance,
we can allow time

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:51.240
to go over many Rabi periods
and observe perturbative Rabi

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.210
oscillations.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.540
So this is how we
have formulated it.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:58.520
We do perturbation
theory of the system

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.440
without spontaneous emission.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.960
And eventually, we
violate our assumptions,

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.970
either because spontaneous
emission kicks in,

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.740
or because we deplete
the ground state

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:13.650
when we drive it too hard, or
if we go too close to resonance.

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:15.620
But the later
assumption, of course,

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.200
that we can't drive it hard,
as you know, is artificial.

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:23.540
We can actually discuss
the monochromatic case.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.620
Not just in perturbation theory,
but we can do it exactly.

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:32.020
STUDENT: I want to
go back again to--

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.895
PROFESSOR: And this is
what I want to do now.

00:58:33.895 --> 00:58:35.532
But first, we can go back.

00:58:38.508 --> 00:58:42.630
STUDENT: So when we are
talking about non-B resonance

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:47.320
and B-resonance, so if
we decrease the detuning,

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.700
then we are getting
close to resonance.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.680
So again, this gets invalid.

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:54.970
But if we increase
the detuning, we

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.230
could exceed the
spontaneous emission rate.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:01.010
So then, we won't see any
Rabi oscillations again,

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:04.200
because, at those time
periods, this oscillation

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.650
would [INAUDIBLE] detuning.

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:09.623
So to observe Rabi
oscillations, we

00:59:09.623 --> 00:59:11.414
have to be at times
more than the detuning,

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:14.517
or more than
[INAUDIBLE] detuning.

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:15.350
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:16.340
Of course.

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.450
STUDENT: So the detuning has
to be less than [INAUDIBLE],

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:24.957
but more [INAUDIBLE] that we
are still [INAUDIBLE] resonant.

00:59:24.957 --> 00:59:25.540
PROFESSOR: No.

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:33.630
The detuning has to be larger
than the natural linewidth,

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.410
because then the Rabi
oscillations are fast,

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.160
and we have Rabi
oscillations which

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:42.160
are faster than any damping
due to spontaneous decay.

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.950
That's an image we
are talking about.

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:47.280
So in the limit of our detuning,
you can detune very, very far,

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.084
and you never reach the limit
of our perturbative abode.

00:59:51.084 --> 00:59:52.080
STUDENT: Yes.

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.842
OK.

00:59:53.842 --> 00:59:55.675
PROFESSOR: Anyway, I
want to do perturbation

00:59:55.675 --> 00:59:57.960
theory of the broadband case.

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.650
And the broadband case
will be an incoherent sum

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:02.200
over the single mode case.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.882
So this is why I had
to bore you with,

01:00:04.882 --> 01:00:06.590
what do we get out of
perturbation theory

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:08.900
for the monochromatic case?

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:12.320
Of course, you know already
that in a two-level system,

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.100
we can do it exactly.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.235
And I just want to
outline it, mainly

01:00:16.235 --> 01:00:17.440
to introduce some notation.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:27.460
So our Hamiltonian
here, which couples

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:39.270
the ground in the excited state
is given by the dipole matrix

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:45.220
element, the electric
field vector,

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.310
and we call this
the Rabi frequency.

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:51.850
And then we have a sinusoidal
or co-sinusoidal frequency

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.990
dependence.

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.690
And all I want to
do is to show you

01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.500
that a two-level system driven
by an electromagnetic field

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.090
is identical to spin 1/2,
which we discussed earlier,

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:04.970
and then we are done.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:11.300
There is one technical or
little trick we have to do,

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.320
which is trivial, but
I want to mention it.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:23.730
So if you want to compare
directly with spin 1/2,

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:32.690
we are now shifting
the ground state

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:36.180
to half the
excitation frequency.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.690
In other words, just to make
the key analogy with the spin,

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:42.710
usually we say for an electronic
transition, we start at 0,

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:43.940
and we go up.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.550
But now we shift things
that the zero of energy

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:50.610
is in the middle between the
ground and the excited state.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.740
And then, it looks like the
excited state, we spin up,

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.430
the ground state, we spin down.

01:01:56.430 --> 01:02:10.000
So with that, our Hamiltonian
is now excited, excited,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.045
minus-- so all I've done
is I've shifted the origin.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:23.060
And the coupling, using
our definition of the Rabi

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:36.700
frequency is couples
ground and excited state.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.530
And excited ground state.

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:45.050
These are the two
off-diagonal matrix element.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:50.450
And the time dependence
is cosine omega t.

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:55.280
So we are now very close to
exploit the correspondence

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.790
with spin 1/2.

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:01.360
Because after shifting
the ground state energy,

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.460
this is the z component
of the spin operator,

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.720
the [INAUDIBLE] matrix.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.230
And this here is
the x component.

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:22.600
So therefore, for driving
an electronic transition

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:30.660
with a laser beam,
we have actually

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:42.691
spin Hamiltonian, which
has the standard form.

01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:44.440
So let me just write
it down, because it's

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.620
an important result.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:51.220
The Hamiltonian for driving
and dipole transition

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:58.260
with a linearly
polarized laser beam

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:06.260
corresponds, or is identical,
to the Hamiltonian for spin 1/2,

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:13.000
in a static magnetic field
along the Z direction,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.370
which causes a splitting
between spin up and spin down.

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:24.030
And the splitting
is now omega eg

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.550
plus a linearly
polarized oscillating

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:45.449
field along the x direction.

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:59.470
And you probably remember that
when we discussed the spin

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:01.940
problem, what we
liked actually most

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:06.500
was that we had a rotating
magnetic field, because it

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.590
made everything simpler.

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:16.200
And we are doing that
now by formally writing

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.880
the [INAUDIBLE] polarized
field as a superposition

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.660
of left-handed and right-handed,
or counter-rotating

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.370
and co-rotating magnetic field.

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.550
So let me just do that.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.690
So we have the Z part.

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:47.160
And now, instead of having
just sigma x, cosine omega t,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.450
I add sigma y,
sine omega t, and I

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:56.400
subtract sigma y, sine omega t.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.560
So now we have shown
that there is something

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.800
in addition to the spin problem.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.780
We discover when we had a
rotating magnetic field,

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:34.110
that we have two components
here which rotate.

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:51.017
And these are the co and
counter rotating magnetic fields

01:06:51.017 --> 01:06:51.850
in the spin problem.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:12.040
And the counter rotating, you
remember in the spin problem,

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:16.540
we solved the problem
exactly by going

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.150
into a frame which rotated at
the Larmor frequency, which

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:24.960
becomes now omega eg.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.970
And the co-rotating term
became stationary on resonance

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:36.490
in this rotating frame, whereas
the counter-rotating term

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:46.830
rotates at a very high frequency
in this frame at the Larmor

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:47.330
frequency.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:08:05.140
So if this frequency, if
you fulfill the inequalities

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:14.200
that the co-rotating term
is close to resonance,

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.560
or in other words, we
are close to resonance,

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.450
and we are not using an infinite
intensity of the laser beam,

01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.630
that we broaden everything
in co and counter

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:28.310
rotating terms of
boson resonance.

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:34.979
So if you fulfill
those two conditions,

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:42.189
then we can neglect
the last term.

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:46.671
And this is the rotating
wave approximation.

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.359
So in other words,
in the spin problem,

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.120
we can always assume
we haven't circularly

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.590
polarized the rotating
magnetic field,

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:06.200
and we have an exact solution.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.899
I say a little bit
more about it later.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:13.140
But in many situations, when
you excite an atom with a laser

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.029
beam, you get both terms.

01:09:15.029 --> 01:09:19.294
And usually, you proceed
by neglecting one term,

01:09:19.294 --> 01:09:23.359
and by making the rotating
wave approximation.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:28.350
will, in one or two
lectures, discuss

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:30.920
whether there are situations
where the counter-rotating term

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.720
is exactly 0 due to angular
momentum selection rules,

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.170
but that's a
separate discussion.

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:38.840
In many situations, it cannot be
avoided, and it's always there.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.700
It's actually always
there to the point

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.399
that when I talk to
some colleagues and say,

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:47.000
I can create a
situation, an atom, where

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.620
the counter-rotating
term is exactly 0,

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.040
some colleagues
reacted with disbelief,

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.630
and then eventually
felt that the situation

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.830
I created for angular
momentum conservation

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:59.090
was somewhat artificial.

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.050
But we'll get there.

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:01.840
It's an interesting discussion.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.020
But anyway, just remember that
for magnetic drive, if you

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.850
use a rotating
magnetic field, you

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:10.760
don't need a rotating
wave approximation.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.650
Everything rotates
at one frequency.

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:16.970
But usually, when you drive a
two-level system with lasers,

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:22.150
we usually have an extra term
which needs to be neglected.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:22.820
OK.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.170
But if you do the rotating
wave vapor approximation,

01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:29.160
we have now exactly
the situation

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:35.360
we discussed for spin 1/2 in
a rotating magnetic field.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.430
And then, the same equation
has the same results.

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:47.500
And then, our results for
spin 1/2 are now as expected.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:56.550
Rabi oscillations without
making any assumptions

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.640
about perturbation theory.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.720
So this is an exact result
for the initial conditions

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.610
that we start in
the ground state,

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:12.450
and the initial population
of the excited state is 0.

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:20.650
And as usual, I have used here
the generalized Rabi frequency,

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:23.770
which is the quadrature sum
of these matrix elements

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:27.360
squared and the detuning.

01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:47.230
OK.

01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:51.985
A lot of it was to get ready
for the broadband case.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.440
So that's-- yes, we have a
little bit more than five

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:58.940
minutes.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:18.090
So, so far, we have discussed
the monochromatic case.

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:22.130
What I really needed
as a new result,

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.220
because I carried over
for the board-band case,

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.040
was a perturbative result.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.340
But I also wanted to show you
that the perturbative result is

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.020
one limiting case of the
exact solution, which I just

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.520
derived by analogy to spin 1/2.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.180
OK.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:52.440
So we just had the result
that in perturbation theory,

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.870
for sufficiently short
times, we discussed all that,

01:12:55.870 --> 01:13:13.582
that the excited state amplitude
has the following dependence.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.510
So this is nothing
else than-- I want

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:27.450
to make sure you
recognize it-- Rabi

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:31.630
oscillations at the
generalized Rabi frequency.

01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:35.380
The generalized Rabi frequency
is simply the detuning,

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.505
because it's a
perturbative result.

01:13:37.505 --> 01:13:38.880
In perturbation
theory, you don't

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.630
get power broadening, because
you assume that your drive

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.620
field is perturbatively weak.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.870
So therefore, the
Rabi oscillation,

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:49.340
our now Rabi oscillation
where the Rabi frequency,

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:53.940
the generalized Rabi frequency,
is delta the detuning.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.962
And this is just rewriting.

01:13:55.962 --> 01:13:56.878
Let me just scroll up.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.870
This is this result here.

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.270
I wasn't commenting on it.

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:11.450
But this is nothing
else than the detuning.

01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:12.504
Look.

01:14:12.504 --> 01:14:15.045
I'm just reminding you what you
get from perturbation theory.

01:14:15.045 --> 01:14:19.550
Power broadening is not
part of perturbation theory.

01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:20.100
OK.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.280
So this is our
perturbative result.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.020
And now, we want
to integrate over

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:33.864
that because we have a broadband
distribution of the light.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:45.010
So what we have to use now is
the energy density, W of omega.

01:14:56.190 --> 01:15:04.670
The electric field is
related, the energy

01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:08.340
of the electromagnetic field, is
1/2 epsilon the energy density

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.380
of the electromagnetic field,
is 1/2 epsilon naught times

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.660
the electric field squared.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:19.500
Well, if you have many modes,
we add the different modes

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.500
in quadrature.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.430
And we still have
the same reaction

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:26.990
between the electric field
squared and the total energy.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:31.950
But the total energy is now
an integral over d omega.

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:34.979
We integrate over frequency
over the spectral distribution

01:15:34.979 --> 01:15:35.520
of the light.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.800
So this is how we go from energy
density to electric feels.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.370
But now, we want to
evaluate this expression.

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.700
And what appears
in this expression

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.920
is the Rabi frequency.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.270
Well, what we have
to do now is we

01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:01.280
have to go back from
the Rabi frequency.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.700
We assume linearly polarized
light in the x direction

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:06.950
to the electric field.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:37.890
And that means, now,
that when we-- OK.

01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:39.960
We want to now take
this expression,

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:45.860
and sum it up over all modes,
which means we integrate over,

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:49.280
we write the Rabi
frequency squared

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.250
as an electric field squared.

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.040
And the electric
field squared is

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.609
obtained as an integral over
the spectral distribution

01:16:55.609 --> 01:16:56.150
of the light.

01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:06.410
So this means we will
replace the Rabi frequency

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:21.880
in this formula by an
integral over the energy

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.175
density of the radiation.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.996
We have the matrix element
squared as a prefactor.

01:17:30.996 --> 01:17:33.070
I just try to
re-derive it, but I

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:37.280
think the prefactor is
2 over epsilon naught.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.930
So, yes.

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:46.070
With that, in
perturbation theory,

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:48.670
the probability to be
in the excited state

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:52.770
is-- let's just take
all of the prefactors.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.950
Now, I change the integration
variable from omega

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:10.320
to detuning, we just
go from resonance--

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.680
we integrate relative
to the resonance.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.360
So our energy density is now
at the resonance, omega naught

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.710
plus the detuning.

01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:23.380
And we have this Rabi
oscillation term.

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:35.510
OK.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:41.020
So this is nothing else than
taking our perturbative Rabi

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:45.960
oscillation formula,
which is coherent physics,

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.750
and indicate over many moles. .

01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:52.660
I'm one step away
from the final result.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:06.720
If the energy density is
flat, is broadband-- so

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.510
for the extreme
broadband case, we

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:11.508
can pull that out
of the integral.

01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:19.370
And then, we are left only
with this function, F of t.

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:46.460
And you can discuss
this function, F of t,

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:48.190
is a standard result.

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:50.670
And we have seen
many discussions

01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:51.890
in perturbation theory.

01:19:56.990 --> 01:20:11.590
If I plot this
function, versus delta,

01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:14.035
we have something
which has wiggles.

01:20:14.035 --> 01:20:16.920
Then, there is a maximum,
and it has wiggles.

01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:23.515
The width here is
t to the minus 1.

01:20:28.962 --> 01:20:31.300
And the amplitude is t squared.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.965
And this is the excited
state amplitude squared.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:59.980
So if we integrate
that over delta,

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.970
we get something
which is linear in t.

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:05.020
Something which goes as
t-square, and has a width 1/t.

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:16.870
Yes, time is over.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:28.460
So the function F of t,
which is under the integrand,

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:35.660
starts out at short
times, proportion

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.560
to t squared, as we discussed.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.056
Maybe my drawing
should reflect that.

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.230
But then it becomes linear.

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:57.920
So for long times, the function
F of t becomes linear in t

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.670
and the delta function
in the detuning delta.

01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:04.870
This is what you
have seen many times

01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:07.390
in the derivation of
Fermi's golden rule.

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.940
I'm running out of time now.

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.880
I'll pick up the
ball on Wednesday,

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.230
and we'll discuss that result
and put it into context.

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.300
But the take-home
message-- and what I

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:20.470
really wanted to show you is
that we do have coherent Rabi

01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:22.170
oscillations.

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:24.950
And by just performing
the integral

01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:29.190
over this broad
spectrum of the light,

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:31.870
we lose the Rabi
oscillations, and we

01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:36.220
find rate equations,
Fermi's golden rule,

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.620
and excitation probability
proportional to t.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:45.880
And we have done the transition
from coherent physics

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.870
to irreversible physics.

01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:50.720
This is all hidden
in this one formula,

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.230
but I want to fully explain
it when we start on Wednesday.

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:56.830
Any last second
question about that?

01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:57.560
Cody?

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.360
STUDENT: It looks
like we're integrating

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.060
right over the point to where
perturbation theory becomes

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.220
an exact, because we're
integrating over delta

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.032
equals 0.

01:23:05.032 --> 01:23:06.490
And that's the most
important part.

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.940
PROFESSOR: We are
integrating over it,

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:17.620
but we are integrating over
it with the [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:22.130
So therefore, since
we have-- perturbation

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.040
theory remains valid, actually.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.550
Perturbation theory
remains valid,

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:28.760
as long as the excitation
probability is less than one.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.660
So I have not put a
scale on it, but we

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.330
can go from a
quadratic dependence

01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:34.230
to linear dependence.

01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:41.610
As long as the probability
of being in the excited state

01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:45.960
is smaller than 1, perturbation
theory is exactly valid.

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.780
So I think what
confuses you here

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.430
is, we can do
resonant excitation.

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:54.080
The broadband includes
resonant excitation.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.570
But for sufficiently
short times,

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:58.870
we reach the rate
equation before we run out

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:01.020
of [INAUDIBLE]
perturbation theory.

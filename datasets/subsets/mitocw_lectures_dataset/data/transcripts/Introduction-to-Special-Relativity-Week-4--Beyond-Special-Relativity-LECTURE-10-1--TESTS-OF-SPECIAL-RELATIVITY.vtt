00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.490
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.730
So we're starting a
new chapter in which

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.800
we look at tests
and implications

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.320
of special relativity.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.770
We started the entire
discussion and evaluation

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.740
of Lorentz transformations
and the description

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.750
of the paradoxes based
on Einstein's postulates.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.440
Those are not axioms, which
means that we do actually

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.090
have to verify.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.240
They are a prediction
of how nature functions,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.420
and experimental verification
is needed to gain confidence

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.570
that those postulates
are actually correct

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.650
or realized in nature.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.040
And we have studied some
of those tests already.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.850
And this serves as a little bit
of a review of the discussions

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.091
we had to this point.

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.650
One experimental test
is stellar aberration,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.420
which we discussed can be
explained by special relativity

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.100
and by velocity addition.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.240
So this gives us some
idea about what light is.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.990
Light isotropy is being
tested in a variety

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.710
of different experiments,
starting from Michelson-Morley,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.720
which basically tests
that the speed of light

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.090
is independent of the
orientation of the apparatus.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.643
We have not discussed in
detail another experiment,

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:41.560
which is very similar.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.720
It's the Kennedy and
Thorndike experiment,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.400
which tests that
the speed of light

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.500
is also independent
of the velocity

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.330
of the apparatus itself.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.890
As one of the
homework assignments,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.110
we looked at de Sitter who
tested that the speed of light

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.620
is independent of the
speed of the source.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.930
And that has been
tested, for example,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.790
with the motion of binary
stars, as we did in our pset,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.110
in our homework assignment.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.720
We can look in particle
physics at the decay of a pion

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.650
into two photons.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.430
And those pions, they can have
a lot of energy, for example,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.730
with a beta of 0.999
times the speed of light.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.610
And still the photons
are of this decay.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.070
They behave like
any other photon.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.690
They move with the
speed of light.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.340
Let me discuss the Doppler
effect and relativistic Doppler

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.270
effect and analyze light
with various frequencies.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.180
And one of the
hypotheses you could have

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.000
is that the photon actually
is a massive particle.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.670
This would directly modify
Coulomb's laws, which

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.030
are tested experimentally.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.020
And those results would be
dependent on the frequency.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.940
There is weird
electromagnetic effect

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.820
if you introduce a mass
to the photons like torque

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.000
on a magnetic ring Again,
here precision measurements

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.960
have been performed.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.090
And they're all in agreement
with the hypothesis

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.440
that the photon is massless.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.000
And we talked about the Doppler
shift and redshift for light.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.100
Another class of
experiment is where

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.950
we look directly
at time dilation,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.950
for example, in the
decay of the muon.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.520
As we discussed, we have
cosmic muons to study,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.800
or we can produce muons
in the laboratory as well

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.030
and study them.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
Or we can put very
precise clocks on planes,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.070
fly them around the globe, and
compare them with stationary

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.850
and just simply measure the
effect of special relativity

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.170
on those clocks.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.070
In all of this experimentation
and experimental verification,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.220
it's important to understand
the importance of uncertainties

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.940
in the scientific
process overall.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.710
I think that--
remember, when one

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.160
has the historic
perspective on science,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.220
one often forgets that
a specific measurement

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.800
comes with an
uncertainty, often,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.670
a statistical uncertainty
or systematic effects, which

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.209
are quite important to quantify
the level of verification

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.529
of the theoretical hypothesis.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.620
One example here
is-- and experiments

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.320
can have biases as well.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.420
And one example of
a biased experiment

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.260
is here one by
Walter Kaufmann who

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.020
tried to measure e/m,
the electric charge

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.370
over the mass of the electron.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.970
But he had a rather
strong theoretical bias.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.610
And he conducted the
experiment at the time Einstein

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.130
was proposing his theory.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.910
The bias really came from
the model of an electron

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.200
at the time.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.120
And, as experiments, they were
inconsistent with Einstein.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.440
So he said Einstein is wrong.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.140
Einstein and Lorentz are wrong.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.600
Planck looked at
this and said maybe,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.697
but Einstein's conclusion
immediately by looking at this

00:05:02.697 --> 00:05:04.490
was, no, this cannot be.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.030
And it took a little bit of
time to tee up those experiments

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.400
until 1940.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.830
You can read more about this
in this Wikipedia article

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.410
about Walter
Kaufmann's experiments,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.270
but let me just
read this to you.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.830
"The prevalent results decidedly
speak against the correctness

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.470
of Lorentz's assumption,
as well as Einstein's.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.270
If, on account of that, one
considers this basic assumption

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.000
refuted, then one
would be forced

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.370
to consider it a
failure to attempt

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.070
to base an entire field
of physics, including

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.220
electrodynamics and
optics, upon the principle

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.440
of relative movement."

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.540
We now know this was wrong,
but scientific process

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.840
happens in scientific
environment.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.380
And I started this
class by explaining

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.760
that one needs to be open
minded to learn and to study

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.100
and to grow scientifically.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.140
And one has to question
the assumptions,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.840
understand the assumptions
when then go into measurements.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.900
So this is the first
part of this chapter

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.470
where we talk about tests.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.530
We will have a discussion
of implications

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.330
of special relativity
as we move on from here.

00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:24.280
PROFESSOR: All right, so we're
going to try to finish up

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.180
oxidation reduction today.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.770
The next unit we're heading
into is transition metals.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.535
So, in the last class we were
talking about delta e knots of

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.940
cells, so the standard potential
of a particular

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.610
electric chemical cell.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
And as we ended class last
time, you had a clicker

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.340
question, which you told me what
the reaction was at the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.530
anode and the reaction at the
cathode for this particular

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.500
electric chemical cell.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.630
So, now we're going to consider,
we're going to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:05.850
calculate what this delta e
nought is for this cell.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.450
So we have an equation that we
can use to calculate delta e

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.750
nought of a cell, and that is
that the delta e or the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.080
potential of the cell, is
equal to the standard

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.520
reduction potential for the
reaction that's occurring at

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.320
the cathode, minus the standard
reduction potential

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.470
for the reaction that's
occurring at the anode.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.770
So you told me which reaction
was occurring at the anode and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.950
which at the cathode
last time.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.080
So we can just go ahead and use
that information in here.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.200
So the reaction that's occurring
at the cathode is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.090
the copper reaction, and the
reaction and the anode is the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.030
zinc reaction, and note here,
I have these written as

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030
reduction potentials, because
we're going to be plugging in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.720
the standard reduction potential
into this equation.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.750
So, where do we get our standard
reduction potentials?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070
Well, your textbook has tables
of many standard reduction

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.850
potentials.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.660
And, of course, on an exam
you would be given that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.750
information.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.900
And the standard reduction
potentials were measured

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.270
against the standard
hydrogen electrode.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.330
So, now we talked last time
about what some of these

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.020
abbreviations mean.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.410
So we can look up the values
and they're all going to be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.630
listed as reduction reactions,
because they are standard

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.430
reduction potentials.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.720
So all the reactions, if
you're looking for ones

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.600
written as oxidation, you'll be
out of luck, they'll all be

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.140
written as reductions.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.940
So here, written as a reduction,
zinc plus 2, two

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.400
electrons to zinc solid,
copper plus 2 plus two

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.750
electrons to copper solid, and
you can look up those standard

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.490
reduction potentials.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.570
And then you can plug them
in to your equation.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.680
Again, the equation is the
standard reduction potential

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.310
for the couple at the cathode
minus the standard reduction

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.160
potential for the reaction
at the anode.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.570
So the reaction at the cathode
is the copper reaction, and so

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.750
we have -- we put in here 0 .

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.330
3 4 0 2, and then minus, and the
zinc reduction potential's

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.550
negative, so it's minus
a minus 0 .

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.430
7 6 2 8, and then if we add
that together we get a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.170
positive value of 1 .

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.350
1 0 3.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.030
And so in doing these, this is a
pretty easy thing to do, but

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.360
I'm sort of emphasizing it
because a lot of people

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.170
out-clever themselves
in doing this.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.360
They say, well, one thing's
being oxidized in this

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.090
reaction, one thing's being
reduced, so I'm looking up a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.480
standard reduction potential,
I'm going to change the sign,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.630
and then plug it in and
change the sign again.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.210
And so they change the sign so
many times and they come up

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.380
with the wrong answer.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.970
So just a hint in doing these
problems, if you always think

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.100
that the equation is asking you
for the standard reduction

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.830
potential, look that value
up and put it in.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.680
Don't do anything fancy with
signs, just use this equation

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.510
as written, plugging in the
standard reduction potentials,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.640
and you'll be all set and you
won't have any problems

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.540
getting it wrong.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.720
So try not to out-clever
yourself and flip signs around

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.260
many times in doing
these problems.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.120
All right, so we have a value,
a positive value then for our

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.360
potential for the cell.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.160
So we can ask the question, in
this type of cell, would the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.290
flow of electrons
be spontaneous?

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.690
What tells us if something
is spontaneous?

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.460
Delta g tells us if something
is going to be spontaneous.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.480
And we mentioned last time
a connection between

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.410
delta g and delta e.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.490
So, delta g tells us if
something will be spontaneous,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.660
and we talked last time of this
equation that delta g

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.100
nought for the cell is equal to
minus n, n here being moles

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.100
of electrons times Faraday's
constant, times the delta e

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.480
nought for the cell.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.550
So here again, we're relating
back to thermodynamics, back

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.610
to delta g, and we're thinking
about whether things are going

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.890
to be spontaneous or not.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.925
So, if we have a positive value
for delta e nought of

00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:23.690
the cell, what's going to be
true then for delta g?

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.180
It'll be negative, and so
will it be spontaneous?

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.120
Yes.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.160
So, if delta e nought is
positive, delta g will be

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.940
negative, and if delta g is
negative, the reaction will,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.210
in fact, be spontaneous.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.080
So the answer, then, is yes.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.950
So now let me introduce some
more terms to you.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.780
Galvanic cell is an electric
chemical cell in which a

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.290
spontaneous chemical reaction
is used to generate an

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.050
electric current.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.965
So on a problem, which you may
have on your problem-set and

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:07.860
have already looked at this,
it'll say something about for

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.310
a galvanic cell.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.050
Well, that wasn't just kind of
random information they're

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.940
throwing out, they're telling
you that the reaction's going

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.970
to be spontaneous
in that cell.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.050
So that will often tell you
what reaction had to be

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.470
happening at the anode, and
what reaction had to be

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.220
happening at the cathode.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.500
Because you need to have it be
spontaneous, you need a value

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.170
for delta e nought, then
it's positive.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.580
So, the information that it's
a galvanic cell tells you a

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.590
lot about the problem.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.690
In contrast, we have
electrolitic cell, and in this

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.790
case, we can put in energy to
provide, to be able to drive a

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.820
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.580
So you can generate a current
to then force and

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.970
non-spontaneous reaction
to go.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.400
So these are 2 different
kinds of cells.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.850
So again, whether something's
spontaneous or not comes back

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.050
to our friend delta g.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.230
So if a cell is operating
spontaneously, that means

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.620
you're going to have a delta
e nought of the cell that's

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.820
positive, which means that
the delta g of the

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.160
cell will be negative.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.720
And we can calculate these delta
e noughts of the cell

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.320
from the standard reduction
potentials, which some nice

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.010
person measured for
us against the

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.190
standard hydrogen electrode.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.910
And so we can look up those
values and then we can

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.270
calculate delta e nought of a
cell, we'll know something

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.240
about whether it will be a
spontaneous reaction or not.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:48.700
So now let's think about the
size and the sign of standard

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.390
reduction potentials and what
they tell us about a

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.180
particular reaction.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.290
So the meaning of the standard
reduction potential that you

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.150
can look up in your book.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.760
So first let's think about what
happens or what would be

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.720
true if we had a large positive
delta e nought.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.590
And that's going to mean that
the element is easy to reduce.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.700
So let's look at an example.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.590
At the top of your table,
you're going to see this

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.140
particular reduction with this

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.010
particular reduction potential.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.920
So we have f two gas plus 2
electrons going to 2 f minus.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.970
And the standard reduction
potential for this is measured

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.840
at plus 2 .

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.450
8 7 volts.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.960
So, as written, that's the
value of the standard

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.650
reduction potential.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.550
That's a large positive number,
so that's going to

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.460
mean that it's easy to
add electrons to f 2.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.470
The delta g nought would
be favorable for that.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:57.020
So then, you can tell me, does
that make f 2 a good oxidizing

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:26.300
agent or not and why?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:42.390
OK, let's do 10 seconds.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.630
Good.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.520
Yes, it is easy to reduce.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.420
So it's easy to add electrons,
which makes it a good

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.950
oxidizing agent.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.940
So let's go back
to the slides.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.010
So, a good oxidizing agent is
something that oxidizes other

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.950
elements and gets
reduced itself.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.140
So it goes around oxidizing
things,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.520
it's an agent of oxidation.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.480
So something that easy to reduce
is going to be a good

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.010
oxidizing agent.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.070
And something that's easy to
reduce is going to have a

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.700
large positive standard
reduction potential.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.540
So, one way to sort of remember
this is for a

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.280
particular couple.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.250
If something has a large
positive delta e nought, the

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.270
oxidized species, the oxidized
species here is the f 2, it's,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.890
of these two things, it's
the one that's oxidized.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.330
So the oxidized species
is very oxidizing.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.480
So that's one way
to remember it.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.270
Large positive delta
e nought, oxidized

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.810
species is very oxidizing.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.180
So, here is a list that is
similar to what you would see

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.110
in the back of your book, and
we just talked about this

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:05.320
couple between fluoride gas and
a fluoride minus up here

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.490
with this large positive
standard reduction potential,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.930
and as it says up
here, oxidized

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.680
form is strongly oxidizing.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.820
Now, here we have positive
numbers, and now we start to

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.540
go to small negative numbers,
and by the time we get down

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.830
here, we have a large negative
number for the standard

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.620
reduction potential, and this
is between lithium plus and

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.380
lithium solid.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.140
So, let's consider what would be
true down on the other end

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.540
of the table.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.780
So a large negative delta e
nought means that the element

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.580
is hard to reduce.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.460
So let's look at this reaction
with lithium.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.480
So we have lithium plus
with lithium plus 1.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.100
When you add one electron to
it, you get lithium solid.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.480
And the standard reduction
potential for doing that

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.590
reaction is minus 3 .

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.840
0 4 5 volts.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.950
So, that's hard to add electrons
to lithium plus 1 --

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.300
lithium plus 1 is very happy
being lithium plus 1, it

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.870
doesn't want that electron back,
and so that would be a

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.460
non-spontaneous, unfavorable
reaction.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:25.040
So, is lithium plus 1 a
good oxidizing agent?

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.780
No, it's not a good oxidizing
agent, but something around

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.310
here is going to be
a good agent.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.650
Lithium solid is a good
reducing agent.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:42.880
So, lithium solid likes to
reduce other things, lithium

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.940
solid likes to be oxidized,
lithium prefers to be

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.660
lithium plus 1.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.200
So it's very happy to be lithium
plus 1, so the solid

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.090
form is a good reducing agent.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.500
So, if we think about what's
true at the bottom of the

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.590
table, then if we have a couple
of plus 1 to the solid,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.660
then if you have a large
negative standard reduction

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.480
potential, the reduced species
is very reducing.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.770
So the reduced species here is
the lithium solid, it is a

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.930
good reducing agent.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:26.690
So, large negative reduced
species is reducing.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.870
And if we go back to work table
then, up here we have

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.700
the big positive numbers.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.950
The oxidized form of this
first couple is very

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.530
oxidizing, at the bottom you
have the large negative

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.140
numbers, and the reduced
form of that

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.530
couple is very reducing.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.290
And you're going to be asked
questions, given different

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.400
elements in problem-sets or on
exams and saying which of

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.110
these is the better oxidizing
agent, which of these is the

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.550
better reducing agent, and be
able to compare, and you need

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.260
to think about where it is,
which are the bigger positive

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.090
numbers, bigger negative
numbers, and you can make

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.590
those comparisons, and if you
remember on the top, big

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.990
positive, oxidized form very
oxidizing, big negative,

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.880
reduced form very reducing,
you'll be all set to answer

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.930
those questions.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.820
And some of this should be
sort of intuitive of the

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.450
things that we've talked about
already in this course.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.400
So we think about the periodic
table for a minute, and here

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.800
are some of the potentials,
lithium is easy to oxidize,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.430
it's a good reducing agent.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.130
If it's lithium plus 1, then
it has a noble gas

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.330
configuration, it's
very happy there.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.540
Whereas fluoride can get its
noble gas configuration if

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.470
it's f minus, so it's easy to
reduce and that makes it a

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.020
good oxidizing agent.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.880
So you can think about this
in terms of it's sort of

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.500
intuitive if you think about
what you know about those

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.230
elements going into this unit.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:04.080
So now, let's think about
calculating a standard

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.190
reduction potential for
this particular

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.750
electric chemical cell.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.960
So we're given equations and
we want to calculate a

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.050
standard potential for this.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.410
So, in doing this then, we're
going to use our standard

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.830
reduction potentials on this
table, it's a little hard to

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.960
see, so I'll go back
over there.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.140
So now we have to figure out
if we see this equation,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.720
what's the reaction that's
going on at the cathode?

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.410
First tell me what's happening
at the cathode -- is it an

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.480
oxidation or reduction happening
at the cathode?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.590
The reduction is happening
at the cathode.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:53.510
Now look at that equation up
there and tell me what is

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.390
being reduced -- which
element is being

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.270
reduced in that equation?

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.120
The iron is being reduced.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.510
So we're going to write the 1/2
reaction, that's balance,

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.100
so there were two iron 3's.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:16.100
And on the other side there's
two iron plus 2's, and how

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.880
many electrons am I talking
about here? two electrons.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.860
So we have the reduction
reaction.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:32.390
Then at the anode, the anode has
an oxidation going on, and

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.690
we only have one choice left
of what's being oxidized.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.580
So, we have -- and
again balanced.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:47.910
We have 2 i minus, and this is
an aqueous solution going to i

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:54.770
2 solid plus two electrons.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:00.210
So we have now our two 1/2
reactions written out, and we

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.000
can look at the potentials for
the standard reduction

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.040
potentials, which we'll
need to calculate

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.600
the e for the cell.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.280
So now we want to calculate
e nought for the cell, and

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.360
that's going to be
equal to the e

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.420
for the cathode reaction.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.010
And that particular couple at
the cathode, we're looking

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:35.880
then at iron 3 plus going to
iron 2 plus -- that's the

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.650
reduction potential that we're
going to be looking up.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:46.400
And then we also need another
standard reduction potential,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.870
the one for the couple at the
anode, and the couple at the

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.380
anode that we're looking
up is i 2 to i minus.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.550
So, if you can see that up
there, it's also in your

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:05.810
handout, then we can plug
in those values.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.480
So, for iron, we have plus 0 .

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:19.160
7 7 0 volts minus plus 0 .

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.190
5 3 5 volts.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.480
And that's going to equal 0 .

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.990
2 3 5 volts, which is
a positive number.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.020
So what would be true about this
reaction in terms of it

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.030
being spontaneous or
non-spontaneous?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.360
Right, so it would be
spontaneous, because you have

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.200
a positive value for delta e, so
we'd have a negative value

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.360
for delta g.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:55.970
All right, so now, let's think
about what the good oxidizing

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.260
and reducing agents are here,
and let's have a clicker

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:06.300
question for that.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.830
So, which is the better
oxidizing agent, iron plus 3

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:17.100
or i 2, and which is the better
reducing agent, i minus

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.320
or iron plus 2?

00:19:19.320 --> 00:20:01.240
So think about that one.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:18.810
All right, let's take
10 seconds.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.220
Very good.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.990
So the trick here is to, again,
think about these two

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.600
different potentials.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.470
Now, unlike the example we had
before, we had a big positive

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.630
and a big negative
value, these are

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.150
both positive values.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:40.460
But one of them is bigger than
the other, and so the better

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:47.180
oxidizing one is going to be
the one of these two, these

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.620
are both the oxidized form.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.730
So the one with the bigger
positive number, the oxidized

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.730
species will be better at
oxidizing, and so that would

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.310
be the iron plus 3, that's the
bigger positive number.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.950
Whereas here, when we're
considering which is the

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.670
better reducing agent, we're
looking at the two reduced

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.320
species here, and here the
thing with the smaller a

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.280
positive number, the reduced
form will be a better reducing

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.260
agent, more reducing.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.670
So again, you can look at where
those are in the table

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.810
and the size difference
between them to

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.250
get the right answer.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.570
So, very good.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:35.710
OK, so now, I want to consider
a biological example for a

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.690
minute, and I'm going to ask a
question that we we'll then

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.360
answer at the end of class.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.430
So in cells, things have
reduction potentials.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.240
Vitamin B12 has a reduction
potential.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.930
In fact, it has one of the
largest negative reduction

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.970
potentials of any biologically
occurring molecule.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.920
And so it has to be reduced
to be active in the body.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.940
So how can something with a very
large negative reduction

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.380
potential be reduced?

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.200
That's the question.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.740
Why should you care?

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.660
Well, because vitamin
B12 needs to be

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.540
reduced to be active.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.000
And the proper functioning of
enzymes, there's only actually

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.180
two that you have in humans that
require B12 -- one that

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.680
requires B12 and folic acid is
thought to be important in

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.010
preventing heart disease, birth
defects, and B12 hs

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.250
recently been linked
to mental health.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.300
In particular, a lack of B12 has
been linked to dementia.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.590
So, these are all pretty
significant things.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.070
So, one thing that I think is
kind of interesting here when

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:54.970
they talk about heart disease,
how many people have heard of

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.550
cholesterol?

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.940
How many people have heard
of homocysteine?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.980
Would you be surprised to know
that homocysteine is a better

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.630
indicator of whether you'll
have heart trouble than

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.800
cholesterol?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.210
Yes.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.410
You would think that you would
have heard of the one that was

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.260
a better link.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.840
Well, homocysteine is actually
a better link to indicate

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.930
whether you might have heart
problems, but the thing is

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.780
that there's not a whole lot
of money to be made there,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.460
whereas there's a lot of money
to be made in drugs that lower

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.480
cholesterol.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.320
So you may realize, if you think
about where you get your

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.020
medical information, it's often
from commercials where

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.910
someone's trying to sell
you something.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.110
And so if there isn't much money
to be made, say, the

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.780
treatment for a condition might
be taking vitamins,

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.730
which there's not a whole lot of
money to be made there, you

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.310
don't hear as much about it.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.780
So, it's important to consider
the source of information

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.270
about your health, and as
scientists, you can all

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.560
evaluate information about
your health now.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.800
All right, so vitamin B12 is
very important, you really

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.620
need vitamin B12 to be
a healthy person.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.640
And most people at MIT are maybe
at this stage are not

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.080
that worried of heart disease.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.820
Many of you are probably not
worried yet about having

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.510
children with birth defects,
but maybe some of you are

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:18.340
worried about mental recognition
of particular

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.300
facts for exams coming up, and
so you may be concerned about

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.610
B12 to keep sharp mentally.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.980
So, where do you get vitamin
B12 and folic acid in your

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.570
diet and how is it reduced?

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.210
So let's first consider where
you get it in your diet.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:42.970
So, does anyone know where you
get vitamin B12 in your diet?

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.900
I heard vegetables.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.110
Anyone agree with vegetables?

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.740
I didn't say if anyone liked
vegetables, does anyone agree

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.070
that vitamin B12 come
from vegetables.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.000
It doesn't.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:14.240
Where does vitamin
B12 come from?

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.030
So, red meat is a good source of
vitamin B12, all meat is a

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.360
good source the vitamin B12.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.700
Plants do not use vitamin
B12 at all.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:31.150
So, people who are vegan are
in trouble in terms of how

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.170
much vitamin B12 they get, but
luckily there are vitamin

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.780
tablets that can help
take care of this.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.260
So meat is really the best
source of vitamin B12.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:47.110
So, I'm always looking for good
references to vitamin

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.300
B12, and I saw one recently.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.740
Has anyone seen the HBO
series, True Blood.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.650
One person.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.900
OK, if you watch that, you will
notice that if you date a

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.990
vampire, you have to make sure
you get extra vitamin B12, and

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.000
that Sookie, of True Blood is
taking vitamin B12 tablets

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.810
just to be on the safe side.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.380
So, vitamin B12.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.470
What about folic acid?

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:24.410
Anyone know where you
get folic acid?

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.450
In the fall, what happens,
people say let's go outside

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:32.210
and look at the trees or look
at the pretty foliage.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:38.190
Any suggestion of where
folic acid comes from?

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:43.150
Oh, wait a minute.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.180
I was at a meeting once where
there was a whole lecture

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.160
about how Norwegian beer was the
best source of folic acid,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.410
and it was, perhaps, not
coincidentally reported by

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.300
Norwegian scientists.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.190
They would not vouch for any
other kinds, but some -- but

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.210
it does come from barleys,
vegetables,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.440
this kind of thing.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.870
So, here is a secret
for healthy diet.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.720
Have some of you seen the orange
juice commercial that

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.960
says "Drink orange juice, it's
good for your heart." That's

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.510
because of this, so that
actually is potentially true.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.120
So you get a lot of folic acid
in orange juice, and folic

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.050
acid is, in fact, good
for your heart.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.320
So, who would have guessed,
some of the claims are

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.780
actually true.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.480
All right, but we still have a
problem, we still need to know

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.770
how its reduced in the body.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.880
And so we're going to come back
to that at the end of the

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.110
lecture and answer that
if we get that far.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.630
All right, so we need to do a
couple more things first so

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.180
everyone can finish their
problem-sets, and the things

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.040
we're going to do is we're
going to look adding and

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.940
subtracting 1/2 cell reactions,
and then get to one

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:02.610
of my favorite things, which
is the Nernst equation.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.290
All right.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.750
So, some of you may have
encountered this problem on

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.500
the problem-set already.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.810
Suppose you need you know a
standard reduction potential

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.470
and it's not given to you in
the back of the book, but

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.600
other things are given to you
in the back of the book.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.290
Can you calculate the
thing you need

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.000
from related equations?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.050
So suppose you really want to
know the reduction couple for

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.480
copper 2 going to copper 1.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.990
But that's not given.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.030
You find copper 2 with two
electrons going to copper 0,

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.830
and you find copper 0 going
to copper plus 1 with one

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.180
electron, and you'll realize
that if you combine these

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.710
equations, you'll get
the desired one.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.980
So if you add these together,
you have copper 2 with one

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.630
electron, one electron
cancels out here.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.240
The copper solids cancel
out and you're left

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.030
with copper plus 1.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.240
So you add these together,
and you know the

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.590
potentials for these.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.340
How do you get the standard
potential for the thing that

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.730
you've come up with, for
the sum of those?

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.520
So, as someone actually asked
me before class, you have to

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.540
go back to free energy, and you
do, but I'm going to drive

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.400
an equation so that you don't
have to go all the way back,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.700
but this is, in fact, how you
do the problem, you think

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.140
about the different
free energies.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:29.860
So, the new reaction, the new
delta g for that new reaction

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.810
will be equal to the delta g
knot for the reduction minus

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.730
the oxidation reaction here.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.910
But we can substitute for
delta g this minus n,

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:42.000
Faraday's constant times our
reduction potential, and put

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.580
it in to this equation here.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.290
And so we have it for the new
reaction, and then the 2

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:51.040
reactions that we're
adding together.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.320
So we have Faraday's constant in
common, so that's going to

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.410
cancel out.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.270
And we can also move n 3 to
the other side, because we

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.670
want to solve for this new e
value, this new standard

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.980
reduction potential.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.740
And so that's going to be equal
to the number of moles

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.790
that are involved in the
reaction that's the reduction

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.150
times its reduction potential
minus the number of moles

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.380
involved in the oxidation
reaction with its reduction

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.255
potential, and then the number
of moles for the reaction that

00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:25.590
-- this new reaction
in question.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.800
So we can use, then, this
equation to look for a 1/2

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.270
cell reaction that is the sum
of two other reactions.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.900
So let's go and use that
equation, then.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.960
So here we have the known values
-- we know the couple

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.560
for copper 2 to copper 0, we
know the couple for copper 1

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:53.040
to copper solid, and this
is what we want to know.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.090
So we can use this equation.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.850
Which of these reactions is the
reduction, what value am I

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:06.220
going to put in here?

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:17.400
Which of these goes into
the reduction?

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:23.310
Which of these is a reduction
reaction?

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.090
Yeah.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:29.340
And how many moles of electrons
are involved?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.500
So, we put in 2 times 0 .

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:38.470
3 4 0 volts, and then over here
in the oxidation, there's

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.680
one electron involved, and we
put in our other potential.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.160
So 1 times 0 .

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.320
5 2 2.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.440
And what are the number of moles
of electrons for our

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.410
desired, final reaction?

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.140
1.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.950
And so, then we can do the
math and come up with an

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.740
answer of 0 .

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.930
1 5 8 volts.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.940
And so now we've just come
up with a new reduction

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.180
potential, we've calculated a
new reduction potential for

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.220
this 1/2 cell reaction
right here.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.460
So, this equation will be given
to you on an exam and

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.600
all you need to do is
know how to use it.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.030
So we've calculated now the
standard reduction potential

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.920
for copper 2 to copper plus 1.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.260
So, just a little note about
when you're going to use this

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.290
and when you're going to use
the other equation that I

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.280
showed you.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.460
So, if we're talking about a
whole electric chemical cell,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.950
the number of moles that are
released at the anode are

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.950
going to equal the number of
moles taken up at the cathode

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.220
and be the number of
moles involved

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.190
in the overall equation.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:54.140
So this equation is not
necessary, and for a full

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.510
electric chemical cell, we're
going to use the equation that

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.940
I gave you before for this delta
e nought for the cell,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.430
so we just use this.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.240
But if it's not a whole electric
chemical cell you're

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.550
talking about, if you're talking
about calculating a

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.910
1/2 cell potential, then you
need to use this equation.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:13.010
Both of these equations will
be given to you on

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.590
sheets for the exam.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.280
This one's for an electric
chemical cell, this one's for

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.030
calculating a 1/2
cell potential.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.690
So again, if it's 1/2 cell
potential, you want to use

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.790
this equation.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:31.290
OK, so now the Nernst
equation.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:36.570
So, some of you may have
encountered in your life where

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:41.410
you go to turn something on
and you discover that the

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.020
battery is dead.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:49.280
So, an exhausted battery is
a sign that your chemical

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:58.500
reaction has reached
equilibrium.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.845
At equilibrium, you're going
to have a zero difference

00:33:59.845 --> 00:34:00.020
potential across your
electrodes, and the battery

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.200
will be not useful to
you at that point.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.060
So, if you -- instead of getting
annoyed next time you

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.660
have a dead battery, you can
think about all, ah, it's

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.150
finally reached equilibrium.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.150
So, we need to think about,
then, to think about how these

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:22.010
cell reactions are happening,
how the potential is going to

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:26.230
change with the composition of
the ingredients in those

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.560
electrochemical cells.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.080
So, we know something about
equilibrium and components of

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.240
reactions again.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.790
So this is a nice lecture to
give coming up with a week

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.880
before the exam, because now
we're going back and reviewing

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.810
the first material on the exam
from chemical equilibrium.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:50.710
So, we know that delta g is
going to change as the

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:54.540
components change until
equilibrium is reached.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.680
And when equilibrium is reached
our delta g is going

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.700
to be equal to zero.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:06.010
Before equilibrium is reached,
delta g will depend on the

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:10.460
delta g nought for the equation,
r t and the natural

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.970
log of q, where q is what?

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.350
What's q?

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.570
The reaction quotient.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:24.390
So we saw this before and we're
back to using it again.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.800
So what do we know about the
relationship between delta g

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.870
nought and delta e?

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:34.860
We know that delta g nought is
equal to minus n, moles of

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.790
electrons times Faraday's
constant times delta e nought.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:44.100
So, we can combine some
things around.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.110
So we can take our equation
that we saw in chemical

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.820
equilibrium and substitute in
values that are related to

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.870
standard reduction potentials.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.810
So we can put in, for this delta
g, minus n Faraday's

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.230
constant times the delta e.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.340
And for delta g nought, we put
in the same thing but now we

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.170
have delta e nought.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.810
And we have r t, gas constant
times temperature times the

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:12.020
natural log of q, our
reaction quotient.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.850
Now we can divide both sides
by n and Faraday's constant

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.650
and we come up with the
Nernst equation.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:24.040
So the Nernst equation tells us
the potential for a cell at

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.100
any given time, at any given
component of ingredients in

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:34.320
the cell, any amounts of, say,
your zinc plus 2, compared to

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.690
the standard potential for that
cell, which you're going

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.520
to calculate from your standard
reduction potentials

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.370
in the table, and then you have
this term, gas constant

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.510
times temperature, number of
moles of electrons involved,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:51.000
Faraday's constant, and you need
to know q, the particular

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.020
composition of the cell
at that given time.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.160
So, just a hint in doing Nernst
equation problems, if

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.990
you're given a problem and it's
giving you concentrations

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:07.120
of things at a particular time,
that should be a clue

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.430
that the Nernst equation is
going to be what you're going

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.090
to want to use here.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.580
So, let let's look
at an example.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.140
Say we have a -- we want to
calculate the cell potential

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.460
at a given time at 25 degrees,
and we know our zinc plus 2

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.690
ions or 0 .

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.270
1 0 molar and copper
2 ions are 0 .

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:34.700
0 0 1 0 molar, and this is the
equation for that cell.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:44.940
So we can look up, again, our
values in the table, and the

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.540
first thing we're going to do,
if we're going to use to

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.260
Nernst equation, is to calculate
the standard

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:56.130
potential for that particular
cell, and here are the values

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:00.630
from the table, and why don't
you go ahead and calculate

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:48.060
that for me.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:39:11.240
All right, so let's just take
10 more seconds on that.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.770
OK, so let's see if we can get
into the 90's pretty soon,

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.400
because we should be
able to do that for

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.680
this particular one.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.560
All right, let's go back to
the presentation here.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.970
So it was actually, this
was pretty easy.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:33.150
I didn't actually mean for these
two things to show up,

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.610
to help you out of what the
reaction at the cathode and

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.220
the anode was, so that
was an easier

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.550
question than I had intended.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.680
So, first you need to think
about if you're given an

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.380
equation here, what's happening
at the cathode,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.540
what's happening at the anode.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.860
As it's written, you can look
and see so copper plus 2 is

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.980
going to copper solid, zinc
solid's going to zinc plus 2,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.440
so you can think about which is
the cathode reaction, which

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.980
is the anode, which has a
reduction, which has an

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.610
oxidation going on, and then
once you know which couples

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.540
you're talking about, then you
can plug in your values.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.330
So, at the cathode, we're going
from copper plus 2 to

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:15.520
copper solid.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.720
We put in our standard reduction
potential, using the

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.880
equation we have a minus, and
then the standard reduction

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.070
potential at the anode, so we
have the oxidation from zinc

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:29.960
solid to zinc plus 2, and we
put in this value and we

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.870
calculate the number here.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:39.340
So then, we have that, we
also need to know q.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:41:10.330
So why don't you tell
me what q is now?

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:27.450
OK, let's just do 10 more
seconds on this.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:32.070
OK.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:38.320
So here, if we go back, q is
going to be equal to products

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.750
over reactants, except things
that are solids are not are

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.550
not changing during
the equilibrium so

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:46.770
we leave those out.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.960
So it's going to be
concentration of zinc plus 2

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.700
over the concentration of
copper, which gives you a

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.740
value of 1 .

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.220
0 times 10 to the 2.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:01.680
So, just a review of q, if you
need help calculating q's,

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.690
we're going to have to extra
problems for the exam coming

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.530
up to be posted on Friday.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:12.110
So, this'll be used
in several units.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.620
So then you need to know n, and
then we have everything to

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.280
go back to the Nernst
equation.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:23.550
So how many moles of electrons
are involved in this?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.100
2.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.450
Sometimes it's not so obvious,
so this can trick people, so

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.680
make sure that you pay
attention to this.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.330
This one is a pretty
obvious one.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:36.280
All right, now we have
everything that we can put in.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.215
You calculated the standard
potential for the cell, you

00:42:41.215 --> 00:42:44.020
calculated q, and you told
me how many moles of

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.140
electrons there are.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.930
So we can go and put this in.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.110
So we calculated positive 1 .

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:52.590
0 3 volts minus the gas
constant times the

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:57.420
temperature, it was at room
temperature, natural log of q.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.260
We had two moles of electrons
and Faraday's constant here.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:07.020
And now if we do the math,
this whole term

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.110
comes out to 0 .

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:13.740
0 5 9 2 volts, and we get our
answer, which is a positive

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.030
number there.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:18.320
So, just a note about
units and constants.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.180
Where did volts come
from here?

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.860
Well, the moles canceled out,
and the kelvin canceled out,

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.600
and we are left with joules per
Coulomb, and conveniently

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.390
for us, joules per Coulomb
is a volt.

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.610
So, all our units add up here.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.430
And just a note about a
significant figures in doing

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:43.310
these problems, the Nernst
equation, boy, significant

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.120
figure fun.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.010
If you want to make sure
you know significant

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:47.250
figures, here you go.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.420
Significant figure rules for
logs, we have significant

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.760
figure rules for multiplication
and division,

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.860
and then significant figure
rules for subtraction.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.730
So, one equation gives you
every type of significant

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.890
figure rule.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:10.030
So, that can be a lot
of fun as well.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:13.060
All right, but I'm going to try
to make it easier for you

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.080
on an exam and avoid
some math mistakes.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.360
All the problems I'm going
to give you are at room

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.610
temperature.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.100
And so, the gas constant is a
constant, temperature for

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.480
these problems is going to be
a constant, always room

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.430
temperature, Faraday's constant
is a constant.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:34.530
So, all of these, I'm going to
give you the value that they

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:40.140
all add up to, and if you use
log instead of natural log,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.830
there's this value as well.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:46.550
So, these will be given to you
on an exam, so you'll see

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:51.540
these equations on the exam as
well and you can use them.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.070
So, this is for natural log,
this is for log, so we are not

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:58.190
going to test your ability to
multiply room temperature

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.290
times the gas constant divided
by Faraday's constant.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.740
So that's going to make it a
little easier in doing these

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.890
problems.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.460
All right, so what about
at equilibrium.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.640
What does q equal
at equilibrium?

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.650
So, q equals k at equilibrium.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.260
What does delta g equal
at equilibrium?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.380
Zero.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:28.990
And so that means that we knew
before, from this equation,

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:33.010
when this is equal to zero, then
delta g knot equals minus

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:38.390
r t, natural log of k, so q
equals k at equilibrium.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.580
And so we had this equation
that we used before.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.010
We now have this equation, so
here it related delta g knot

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.930
to the equilibrium constant,
here we relate delta g nought

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.830
to delta e nought And
so, I think you

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.420
can see what's coming.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:46:00.560
We are going to relate these two
together and come up with

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.620
an expression where are you
can calculate equilibrium

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.550
constants from standard
reduction potentials.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.190
So, you may be asked
to do this as well.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.680
So everything in these
units are, in fact,

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.060
related to each other.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.192
And the only thing we have left
today, the answer to this

00:46:20.192 --> 00:46:23.960
question about how B12 is
reduced in the body.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.640
So, you're just going to have
to wait to find out, don't

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.050
worry you won't get heart
disease between now and

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.320
Friday, and I'll let
you know how it all

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.240
works out on Friday.

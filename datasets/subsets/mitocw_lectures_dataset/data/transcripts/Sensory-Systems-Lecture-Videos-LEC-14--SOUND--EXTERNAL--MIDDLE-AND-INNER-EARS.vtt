00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.740
PROFESSOR: And I thought
that what we'd do today

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.900
is first go over this
syllabus for audition, which

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.040
is the second part
of the course.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670
Just so you get an idea of
what's in store for you.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.610
And then today's lecture
will have a big part

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.780
on sounds, which have
physical properties that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.630
are very different than the
light stimulus you guys have

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.610
been talking about
so far in the course.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.900
And we're going to illustrate
the different types of sounds,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.195
very simple sounds
like pure tones.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.450
And very complex sounds
like human speech,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.770
which have many, many
components in them.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.970
And then we'll get into
the auditory system,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.295
first starting with
the auditory periphery.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.090
And we'll talk about the
three basic divisions

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.080
of the auditory periphery,
which are the outer, middle,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.850
and inner ear.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.440
And today we're
really only going

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.470
to have a chance to
focus on the functions

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.219
of the outer and
the middle ears.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.635
And so we'll talk about the
functions of those structures.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.050
So as far as the syllabus
goes, each of the lectures

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.840
has a title.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.620
So today's title, October 28th,
is sound, external, middle,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.345
and inner ears.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.270
And each of the lectures
has a reading or more

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.720
accompanying it.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.680
And so most of the readings
are from the textbook.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.960
So there's a textbook,
Schnupp, Nelken,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.820
and King, which is a very good,
up-to-date textbook written

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.710
by two psychophysicists.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.880
And one physiologist,
Israel Nelken.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.570
And it's written at just the
right level for this class.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.060
That is an advanced
undergraduate textbook.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.970
So it's pretty easy to read,
or should be very easy to read.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.284
And it's written very well.

00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:29.450
These guys are good writers.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.740
They have many examples
of auditory demonstrations

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.180
that you can listen
to just by clicking

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.670
in the margin of the text.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.030
The demonstration we'll come up.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.020
And as you can see,
after today's lectures,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.440
I like to give demonstrations.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.250
Because I like to
listen to what we're

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.970
talking about in
terms of how does

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.355
it really sound to
you as a listener.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.370
So I'd encourage you
to get that textbook.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.960
Now you could buy a hard
copy, or if I'm not mistaken,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.410
Michelle you can get
a free copy online.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.598
Is that right?

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:06.056
AUDIENCE: There's
an online version

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:08.757
as well that you can
read on [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:09.340
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.839
Great.

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:14.545
So if you have any trouble
figuring that out, let me know.

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:16.420
But I think you should
easily be able to find

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.211
the online version.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.320
And it should have
the demonstrations

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.845
that you can listen to
with earbuds or headphones.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.900
There is for today these
passages from the textbook.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.760
And then for today and
for many of the lectures,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.490
there is another reading,
which is a research paper.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.440
This one is by Hofman,
Van Riswick, and Opstal.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.410
And it's titled, Relearning
Sound Localization

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.300
with New Ears.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.380
And this we'll talk
about in class right

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.980
at the end of
today's lecture when

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.250
we talk about the
function of the outer ear,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.410
the pinna, so-called.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.050
And they did a very
interesting experiment

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.700
that addresses what is the
function of your external ear.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.310
So people always ask me,
what am I responsible

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.470
for in these readings.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.240
Well this is a very
specific paper.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.750
It has a lot of interesting
research methods.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.696
The subjects were
human volunteers.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.700
And there are a lot
of details in there

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.610
that are not that important.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.380
What I'm really focused
on having you learn

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.900
is the take-home message.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.320
And the take-home
message from this paper

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.575
is, what is the function
of the outer ear.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.280
And what is this twist
in the title, how can

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.900
you relearn sound localization
with different outer ear.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.560
We'll talk about it in class.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.270
But I want you to get
the take-home message

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.950
from these research studies.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.700
Because there sort of what
we do as professionals

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.990
in the auditory system.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.310
Our day-to-day living
is doing research.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.930
In some cases on human
subjects, in some cases

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.933
on individual molecules.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.530
But how can we
learn about hearing

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.420
from doing these
research studies?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.270
And I have picked good
papers, good research studies.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.920
Because they really
tell us something.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.480
There's plenty of
stuff out there

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.350
that gives sort of
equivocal results.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.940
But this is a really good paper.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.530
And you have a
take-home point from it

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.040
about how you use your outer
ears to localize sounds.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.850
So that's an example
of a research paper

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.220
that goes along
with this lecture.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.040
So just coursing through
the syllabus-- on Wednesday,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.775
we'll have a lecture
on hair cells.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.820
Next week we'll talk about
the auditory nerve, which

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.960
is the nerve that sends hearing
information from your ear

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.745
into your brain.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.320
And we'll talk about
frequency resolution--

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.540
how we can tell one
frequency from another.

00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:05.300
At the end of next
week, we'll be

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.600
talking about the brain, the
cochlear nucleus, and all

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.595
the interesting unit and cell
types in the cochlear nucleus.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.210
The following week,
we're going to be talking

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.970
about hearing
loss, how there can

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.310
be problems with your hearing.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.450
Many of them are treated
at the hospital where

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.850
I do my research, which is
Massachusetts Eye and Ear

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.380
Infirmary across the river.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.820
And there, when the
surgeons in my department

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.550
encounter a deaf
person, they give them

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.470
the option to get
a cochlear implant.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.690
So a cochlear
implant is a device

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.680
that can be put
in your inner ear.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.420
And it can restore
your sense of hearing.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.260
And we'll have a demonstration
by that cochlear implant

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.120
user who comes to
class on that date

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.180
and gives a demonstration of
her cochlear implant, which

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.505
has restored hearing to
her, although not perfectly.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.420
So then later on
in the semester,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.800
we'll talk about
various other topics

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.460
on up through the
auditory cortex.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.130
And finally, we're going to have
a tour of the Hearing Research

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.930
Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Eye and Ear Infirmary,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.270
where we'll meet
over there and we'll

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.590
encounter various
research projects

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.047
that are currently going on.

00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:27.130
And we'll talk about them.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.780
There is a written assignment.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.390
I guess you guys had an
assignment for vision

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.460
in the class-- a written paper?

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.970
So we have an analog here
on the auditory system.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.540
And this is the assignment
you can read it later

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.370
at your leisure.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.180
It won't make much
sense right now,

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.710
because we haven't talked
about neural circuits

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.880
for localization of sounds yet.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.120
You can look on the syllabus.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.840
It's about halfway through
the second part of the class.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.950
And there's a lot
of details here.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:04.130
And it asks you what's updated
since an original model was

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.650
postulated by a researcher
called [? Jeffrus ?].

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.600
So that's a paper--
I don't think

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.940
I said how long it should be.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.250
How long was the
paper for vision?

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:16.960
Was there a link?

00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:19.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.770
PROFESSOR: Four to six pages?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.165
OK, four pages sounds good.

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:25.820
If you really want to write
six, you probably could.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.480
But we'll talk
about this when we

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.020
talk about sound
localization in the class.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.480
And I think the due
date here is written.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.210
It's the date of the lab tour.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.340
And then, we have a
final exam in the class.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.010
And I think as Doctor
Schiller talked about

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.440
at the very first
day, the final exam

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.890
will be waited toward
the auditory system,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.181
which we haven't had a test
on by the time this exam rolls

00:08:56.181 --> 00:08:56.680
around.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.340
So I think it's going
to be 2/3 audition

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.960
on the final exam,
and 1/3 vision.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.070
And there are several
review sessions

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.960
for both senses planned at
the end of the semester.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.822
So any questions
about the organization

00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:15.340
of what we're going to do?

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.100
OK, so I'll start
today's lecture.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.910
And I think the PowerPoint
files-- for today's lecture

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.280
and all the rest of the lectures
for the rest of the semester

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.260
are available in
the course website.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.380
So you can look at them now
or as the lecture comes up.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.820
So first, we're
going to talk about

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.820
the physical
characteristics of sound--

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.450
just very, very different
than the characteristics

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.755
of the light stimulus.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.550
And maybe light stimuli are
so obvious that Peter Schiller

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.450
probably didn't spend much
time in his lecture about it.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.450
But I'm going to spend
10 or 15 minutes here

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.290
on the physical
characteristics of sound.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.720
Because it's very different
than the light stimulus.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.880
So sound is a mechanical,
radiated energy,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.660
transmitted by longitudinal
vibrations of a m

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.485
so you have to have a
medium to transmit sound.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.490
You can have light go
through outer space

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.415
in a complete vacuum.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.379
But in outer space,
you can't have sound

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:37.795
because you have
to have a medium.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.510
The medium can be
various types of things.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.690
We're going to talk
mostly about sound in air.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.830
But you could have sound in
water-- whales make songs,

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.120
and they sing to each other, and
one whale listens to another.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.640
And in between the two
is a medium of water.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.670
You can have sound in a solid--
if you live in an apartment

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.330
room, and you hear your
neighbors' music, you

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.500
especially here the base.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.090
Because the low frequency
sound transmits pretty well

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.380
through solids, like
the solid of the wall

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.635
in between the two apartments.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.240
Sound can go in many, many
different types of media.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.220
In air, like we're going to
use mostly for this course,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.430
you can think of sound
is being produced

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.630
by a sound source like the
piston of your loudspeaker.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.240
And the piston goes
back and forth. .

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.840
It's driven back and forth
by an electric voltage

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.720
and when it goes this way, it
presses on the air molecules

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.440
in front of it.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.640
And it presses them so
they're closer together

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.795
and makes them a little
bit higher in pressure.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:58.330
And that's what's meant by this
compression or condensation.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.140
And these dots close
together means a little bit

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.335
of an area of high pressure.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.730
Then as the piston moves
the other direction,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.590
it rarefies the air.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.020
It drags some of
the air with it.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.320
And so that little space
right in front of the piston

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.140
has a lower pressure.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.210
Because there are fewer
molecules per volume

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:19.765
than before.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:28.420
So this energy, then, is
transmitted through the medium

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.700
to whatever-- a microphone,
which detects sound,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.290
or a listener, which
can listen to the sound.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.870
If you have a microphone or
some kind of detector that

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.390
can plot that pressure
at any one point--

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.312
let's say the microphone
is right at the edge

00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:47.895
of this paper.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.980
And you graph the pressure as a
function of time on this graph.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.385
So here's pressure
and here's time.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.040
As those radiated energy
wave fronts pass you,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.860
the pressure will go up.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.070
And then it will go down.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.150
And then it will
go up and go down.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.045
And it will repeat over and over
as long as that piston moves.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.500
So this horizontal
line is simply

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.140
the barometric or static
pressure of the air.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.210
And sure, the barometric
pressure changes a little bit.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.060
If there's a hurricane
coming, it gets way low.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.100
If there's a high pressure
like we have right now--

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.260
sunny climate, the
barometric pressure goes up.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.186
But those are very
slow fluctuations.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.340
And the sound wave form is
a very, very fast waveform

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.960
that goes many times per second.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.580
In fact, what we call
as sound frequency

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.945
is the number of oscillations of
that pressure wave per second.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.650
And they are very fast.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.480
As you can see down here
on this so-called audiogram

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.820
or frequency curve
for human hearing,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.290
the frequencies, which
are on the x-axis here,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:19.490
go from 10 Hertz-- Hertz
means cycles per second--

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:26.250
so one Hertz is one
cycle per second.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.270
And that is a
frequency that's so

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.610
low it didn't get on this graph.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.750
Because humans
aren't sensitive to

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.970
frequencies that
slow or that low.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.550
Usually the lower
limit for human hearing

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.640
is considered to be about 10
cycles per second, or 10 Hertz.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.290
And it extends all the way up
to 20,000 cycles per second.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.910
And in the middle
of the human range,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.440
we'll be talking
about hearing a lot

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.640
at a middle frequency
of about 1,000 Hertz.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.890
So that's a nice, round,
middle frequency for you

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.900
to remember for human hearing.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.620
So we're talking about
pressure oscillations

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.900
in terms of thousands
of times per second,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.436
or hundreds of times per second.

00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:14.310
So they're very fast.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.020
There will be examples
during our course

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.210
where the auditory system--
the auditory neurons

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.660
keep track of those
cycles, even though they're

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.160
going back and forth
thousands of times per second.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.710
So we'll come back to
that in future lectures.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.000
Now this is the audiogram
for human hearing

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.280
in the solid curve here.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.290
This is supposed to say
human, if you could read it.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:48.350
And on the y-axis is
how strong the stimulus

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:55.250
is, how loud it is, or in terms
of physical characteristics,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.390
what the sound pressure is.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.950
And this scale goes
from minus 20 to 140.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.150
And the units are
dB SPL and that

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.605
stands for decibels
sound pressure level.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.600
And whenever you hear
level in a formula,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.910
you should perk up your
ears and say oh, that

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.170
means there's a log-- a
logarithm-- in the formula.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.790
And sure enough, the formula
for a sound pressure level

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:31.124
is 20 times the log of
whatever sound pressure

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:32.540
you're talking
about, whatever you

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.350
were listening to or measured
by your microphone divided

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.980
by some reference pressure.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.860
That's the formula.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.520
And the reference
pressure is given

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.670
as 20 micronewtons
per square meter.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.040
OK, so let's figure that out.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.660
What is Newton a unit of?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.160
Anybody?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.826
AUDIENCE: Force.

00:16:54.826 --> 00:16:58.950
PROFESSOR: Right, force--
and meter squared is area.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.645
So we're talking about force
per area, and that's pressure.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.060
So Newton obviously was like
Hertz, one of the people

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.380
who was interested in physics.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:17.010
And a Newton is a unit of force
per square meter is pressure.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.380
Now in more modern terms,
the unit micronewton

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.369
per square meter
has been renamed

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:33.340
to be a pascal, abbreviated Pa.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.530
So it's the same.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.630
One Pascal is one
Newton per square meter.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.100
In this case, we're talking
about micro-- Newtons

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.875
are micro Pascals.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:57.520
So why is that number
chosen as the reference

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.070
for this very important
sound pressure level scale?

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.975
Well, it's actually chosen with
the hearing system in mind.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.930
What they did in the 1930s,
when this was being developed,

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.500
is they rounded up a bunch
of people at a county fair,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.600
gave them headphones,
and said we're

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.330
going to try a
nice mid-frequency.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.200
Let's try 1,000 Hertz.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.110
They gave them a
tone at 1,000 Hertz.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.290
The listeners listened to it.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.430
Then they said I
can hear that fine.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.930
Then they turned the
level down a little bit.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.930
And the person said yeah,
I can still hear that.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.980
Then they turned it down so
much that the person didn't say,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.530
I hear something.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.060
There were silent.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.840
They turned it up a
little-- says yeah,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.730
I hear-- They turned it down.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.320
They titrated the levels until
it was right at threshold,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.555
just barely detectable.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.420
And they took an average
of 30-some people.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.240
And they said that
is going to be

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.910
the basis of our sound
pressure level scale.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.940
So it's actually a term that
was derived biologically

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.810
by testing people's hearing.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.870
So that's kind of a nice story.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.030
I wonder if it's true.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.780
Well, let's look at it.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:22.930
Where does the human hearing
curve, that 1,000 Hertz, fall?

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:28.850
Where should it fall if 20
micronewtons per square meter

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.510
is the pressure
you're talking about?

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.440
It's the same as the
reference pressure.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.050
What's 20 over 20?

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.360
It's 1.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.705
What's the log of 1?

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.730
Zero.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.600
Correct.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.432
20 times the log of 1 is
0-- sound pressure level 0.

00:19:47.432 --> 00:19:48.890
Well, look at our
curve right here,

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.540
that 1,000 Hertz--
it's pretty close to 0.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.920
Why might it not
be exactly zero?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.014
Well the people that
were used for this curve

00:19:58.014 --> 00:20:00.555
were a little bit different than
the ones in the county fair.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.615
We'll study later on that some
people have a hearing loss.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.354
Hearing can be affected
by the room that you used.

00:20:10.354 --> 00:20:12.270
Maybe there was a lot
of yelling and screaming

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.225
at the county fair.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.545
We have better rooms
to test hearing now.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.140
It turns out that the human
hearing curve is actually

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.720
a little more sensitive at
2,000, 3,000, and maybe 4,000.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.510
So when the pressures go
below the reference pressure,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.030
the number becomes less than 1.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.620
And the logarithm
becomes negative.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.290
It's perfectly fine to
have a negative SPL.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:45.500
We have some points on the graph
for that-- minus 2, minus 3 dB.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.630
This other dashed audiogram,
or hearing sensitivity curve,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.890
is for a different
species-- the cat.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.770
And the cat here's
down to about minus 10

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.490
dB SPL-- at least this
group of cats did.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.210
The cats also hear higher
in frequency than humans.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.650
Dogs and cats can
hear about an octave

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.730
higher-- that is a
doubling of frequency

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.200
higher than humans do,
and maybe some of you

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.990
have had dog whistles
that you blow.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.210
And you don't hear anything.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.760
But the dog comes because
it's a very high frequency

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.280
beyond the upper limit
of human hearing,

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.275
but well within the hearing
range of those species.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.760
So different species have
different hearing ranges.

00:21:37.854 --> 00:21:38.775
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:39.400
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.352
AUDIENCE: Sorry--
just to clarify,

00:21:42.352 --> 00:21:46.288
is a micropascal
then [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:46.288 --> 00:21:47.280
PROFESSOR: No.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.070
These are units of pressure--
micronewtons per square meter--

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.395
and this is a unit of pressure.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.455
SPL is just in these
units called decibels.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.769
And it it's not a pressure--

00:22:05.769 --> 00:22:07.060
AUDIENCE: It's the log of that.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.600
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.675
It's the log of that.

00:22:10.767 --> 00:22:11.600
Any other questions?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.700
So these are sort of the
lower limits of hearing.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:26.020
When you go into conversational
levels, or the level of a lawn

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.870
mower, or the
level of a concert,

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.390
the levels get higher--
still certainly

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.850
within your audibility range.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.700
As you go to a higher
and higher level,

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.190
you risk damage to your hearing.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.690
And at that risk level, which it
says high risk thresholds here.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.790
And right around 120 dB,
sounds become painfully

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.400
loud and damaging
to your hearing.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.600
And that's what this
shaded area refers

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.960
to-- gunshots, jet
aircraft engine.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.760
And we'll talk about that during
our lecture of hearing loss.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.933
So I have some demonstrations.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.880
Because a lot of people have
trouble with the decibel scale.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.350
So what is a decibel?

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.840
And what does it sound like when
you change the sound from 50

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.820
dB to 60 dB?

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.710
Well this demonstration
has three parts.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.670
And let me read the text first.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.120
Broadband noise-- sometimes
it's called white noise.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.840
Broadband noise and
white noise are synonyms.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.337
And what is white light
as a visual stimulus?

00:23:45.337 --> 00:23:46.420
AUDIENCE: All wavelengths.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.350
PROFESSOR: All
wavelengths, right?

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.862
And so broadband noise means
it has all frequencies.

00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:55.140
It has 10 Hertz, 20
Hertz, 30 Hertz, 1,000

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.565
Hertz, 2,000-- it
has all frequencies.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.270
And it sounds like
the "shh" sound.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.420
So you hear this "shh."
it'll start out pretty loud.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:15.220
It'll be reduced in ten steps
of six decibels for each step.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.211
And I think you'll be
able to very clearly hear

00:24:18.211 --> 00:24:20.460
the difference between the
first and the second steps.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.500
And demonstrations
are repeated once.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.900
The second demonstration
is same noise

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.680
is reduced in 15 steps--
now of three decibels.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.290
So this is a little
bit of a smaller scale,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.240
though you'll still
be clearly audible.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.450
Third, broadband
noise is reduced

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.880
in 20 steps of now one dB.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.255
So let's listen to see if
we can hear 1 dB steps.

00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:52.526
RECORDING: The decibel
scale-- broadband

00:24:52.526 --> 00:24:57.949
noise is reduced in
10 sets of 6 decibels.

00:24:57.949 --> 00:25:00.907
[INAUDIBLE] repeated once.

00:25:00.907 --> 00:25:12.290
[TONE] [TONE]

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.787
OK, was that clear--
the difference

00:25:14.787 --> 00:25:15.870
between one and the other?

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.920
So that's what 6 dB sounds like?

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.780
Now, you guys who are up
here close to the speakers,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.240
you might be starting at 85 dB
SPL on the first ones-- pretty

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.540
loud.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.976
6 dB lower is 79.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.780
And then, so on and so forth.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.960
You guys at the back are
further from the speaker.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.190
You're not starting
at the same level.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.520
You might be starting at 60 dB.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.700
You're still going down 6 dB
to 54 dB in the next step.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.200
Everything is linear in here.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.980
It doesn't matter
where you start from,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.150
as long as you're
going down 6 dB.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.830
So where you start doesn't
really matter in these demos.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.790
RECORDING: Broadbad
noise is reduced

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.710
in 15 steps of 3 decibels.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:16.880
[TONE] [TONE]

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.817
PROFESSOR: OK, still
clear the increment

00:26:18.817 --> 00:26:19.900
between one and the other?

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.480
OK, now here's the one dB steps.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.021
RECORDING: Broadband
noise is reduced

00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:26.967
in 20 steps of one decibel.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:52.150
[TONE] [TONE]

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.270
PROFESSOR: OK so
how about for that?

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.740
Would you be able to stake
your life on the fact

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.700
that you could tell
one from another?

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.110
No, I see a lot
of heads shaking.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:05.390
Well if you sit there and
do this over and over again,

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.870
and really train
yourself, apparently 1 dB

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.950
is the just
noticeable difference

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.665
that most observers can here.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:27.465
So 1 dB is the just
noticeable difference in SPL.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.860
So how do we do that?

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.490
Well you have an auditory nerve.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.740
And at 60 dB, your
auditory nerve fibers

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.730
are sending this many
spikes to the brain.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:05.340
At 61 dB, they're sending maybe
a few more spikes-- something

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:05.840
like that.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.040
It's not absolutely
clear how you do that.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.060
There is more information coming
in from the ear to the brain

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.580
as a function on sound level.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.746
We'll talk a lot about that.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.915
Now, we also talked
about sound frequency.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.640
JND for sound level
is about 1 dB.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.110
What is it for sound frequency?

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.960
We're going to have pretty
much a whole lecture on that.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.620
But your ear is extremely
good at telling one frequency

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.000
from another.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.390
So if you start at 1,000
Hertz and change it to 1,002

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.560
Hertz-- very, very
small change--

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.522
you can tell the difference.

00:28:49.522 --> 00:28:52.435
Your ear is a fantastic
frequency analyzer.

00:28:53.442 --> 00:28:54.900
We're going to have
a whole lecture

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.440
on exactly how
your ear does that.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.490
But the JND for sound frequency
is also a good demonstration.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.560
We'll play that when we talk
about sound frequency coding.

00:29:07.551 --> 00:29:08.050
OK.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.715
Any questions about that so far?

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.860
OK.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.075
Let's switch back to the
physical characteristics

00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:20.575
of sound.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.140
And these are some very
common auditory stimuli.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.140
We've heard a noise just now.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.450
And if you graph the sound
pressure as a function of time,

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.470
this is what the
waveform looks like.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.730
How could you do that?

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.670
If you take a
microphone, stick it out

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.970
in front of a noise source, and
run that into an oscilloscope,

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:48.650
the microphone converts the
sound pressure into a voltage,

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.900
the oscilloscope displays
the voltage signal

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.960
as a function of time.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.102
You can look at that.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.150
Auditory scientists
like to look at things

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.750
as a function of
time, of course.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.770
They also like to look
at things as a function

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.275
of sound frequency.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.400
This is a graph for this same
stimulus, a noise stimulus,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.320
now as a function of frequency.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.890
And we said before,
the noise is broadband.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:18.790
It's white noise.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.250
It has all frequencies.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.640
And here is the graph
to show you that.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.330
This might be the
energy, and this

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.310
is as a function of frequency.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.590
So it has all frequencies.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.400
It's trailing off a little
at the very highest.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.450
That may be because the
microphone couldn't wiggle

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.490
back and forth at very,
very high frequencies.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.690
But it's essentially a
flat frequency curve.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.213
And sometimes this display
is called the spectrum.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.724
So spectrum or spectra
are graphs as a function

00:30:54.724 --> 00:30:55.265
of frequency.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.000
Sometimes people talk
about this as a frequency

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.940
domain and the time domain.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.960
If you've taken any electrical
engineering courses here

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.660
at MIT, people will talk about
the time and frequency domains.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.920
And how can you go from one
representation to another?

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.720
Well, you can take
your microphone signal

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.710
instead of going to
the oscilloscope,

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.860
going to the spectrum
analyzer, which

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.660
is a machine that can
give you this nice plot.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.390
But how about mathematically?

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.500
How can you do that?

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.460
The Fourier Transform, right.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.470
Of course, Fourier
was a mathematician

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:50.450
who studied various things,
heat transfer and other things.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.030
He developed this
transformation.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.240
If you have the
mathematical description

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.290
of a time-varying
signal, you can

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.790
plug it through his equation,
the Fourier transform,

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.520
and come out with the frequency
representation or the frequency

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.020
domain.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.740
Or, vice versa, if you
have the frequency domain,

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.729
you can inverse Fourier
transform and go back

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:11.520
to the time domain.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.140
We're not going to talk too
much about transforms here.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:21.140
But it is interesting,
because, as it turns out,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.910
your inner ear is a
wonderful frequency analyzer.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.350
It can tell the difference
between 1,000 and 1,002 Hertz.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.380
This is a very
nice way in the ear

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.170
of detecting the
different frequencies.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.780
And so these time and frequency
domain representations

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.720
are very convenient
for us to look at.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.010
So just keep that in mind.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:50.570
Here's a very common auditory
stimulus, the pure tone

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:51.330
or the sinusoid.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.910
This is a sinusoidal
waveform in the time domain.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.866
In the frequency domain,
it only has one frequency--

00:33:00.866 --> 00:33:02.240
the frequency at
which that thing

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.050
is going back and forth
in terms of Hertz.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.230
This is in a Hertz axis.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.050
So sometimes it's
called a pure tone.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.060
Why is it so pure?

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.230
Does it have high
morals or what?

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.255
No, it just has one
sound frequency.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.900
These other stimuli,
we're going to listen

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.110
to this in just a minute.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.945
This is a so-called square wave.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:37.910
Imagine trying to add up a
whole bunch of pure tones

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.030
to result in a square wave.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.660
It seems impossible, right?

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.770
Well, it's possible if
you use an infinite number

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:46.570
of frequencies.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.690
And this frequency
representation

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.550
for a square wave goes
on basically forever.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.090
To get those corners
of the square wave

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.380
sharp like a true
square wave, you

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.560
need lots of
individual frequencies,

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.770
lots of pure tones, if you will.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.468
Tone bursts are some
common auditory stimuli.

00:34:10.468 --> 00:34:12.259
We'll talk about those
later in the course.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.710
Click is a very common
auditory stimulus.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.860
It's a sound like this.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.250
Or last night, it was
the sound of a fastball

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.724
hitting a wooden baseball bat.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.210
It's a very sharp, impulsive
sound, very nice sound

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.400
if you're behind the
team who's batting.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.300
So a click, that
baseball hitting the bat,

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.290
doesn't happen for very long.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.539
A click can be
infinitesimally short.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.480
The time that the baseball
is in contact with the bat

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.409
is pretty short.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.780
And if it's very short
in the time domain,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.394
then you have all frequencies.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.290
So it's another example of a
broadband or broad spectrum

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.590
sound.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.310
If the click is
infinitesimally short,

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.580
the spectrum is completely flat.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.240
Those are some common
auditory stimuli.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.870
Let's go through some
more complicated,

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.170
and maybe more
interesting, sounds.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.420
Well, all of us like to
listen to music, right?

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.900
So here are some examples
of musical sounds.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.006
This is a piano keyboard.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:38.000
And here is the spectrum
or frequency representation

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.290
of what you get when you strike
one key on the piano keyboard.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.470
So that's one note.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.890
Well, sure, it sounds
like one thing,

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.910
but you have a whole bunch
of different frequencies

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.160
that go along with it.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.640
And why is that true?

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.390
Does anybody know?

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.598
Why do you get a whole bunch
of different frequencies

00:35:58.598 --> 00:36:01.550
when you strike a key
on the piano keyboard?

00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:04.889
Yeah?

00:36:04.889 --> 00:36:07.857
AUDIENCE: Isn't it vibrating
all along the length

00:36:07.857 --> 00:36:12.330
so there's different
wavelengths?

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.555
PROFESSOR: What's vibrating--

00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:14.735
AUDIENCE: It's not--

00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:15.200
PROFESSOR: In the piano?

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.650
AUDIENCE: It's not-- it's like
an infinitely small portion

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.210
of the string.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.812
It's the longer string.

00:36:22.812 --> 00:36:28.660
It's parts that are
shorter still vibrating.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you're getting there.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.470
In the piano, the string
is fixed at one end,

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.415
and it's a long string.

00:36:37.415 --> 00:36:39.030
It [? fits ?]
[? in ?] the other.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.900
And your key that you press
down makes a hammer go up,

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.340
and there's a bunch of linkages.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.450
And eventually, the hammer
hits that string somewhere.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.970
And the string, it's fixed here.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.620
It's not going to move.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.370
It's fixed here.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.400
It's not going to move.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.670
But in between those
points, it can move.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:04.070
So it can vibrate like this,
or it can go up and down.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.240
It can also vibrate like this.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.860
You can have what's called
a node in the middle.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:24.310
In fact, if you put your finger
right here and fix that middle,

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.470
it wouldn't allow
the string to vibrate

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.570
in this uniform fashion.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.460
But it would allow this half
to vibrate and that half

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.210
to vibrate.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.795
This node is sort of a
constraint for this string.

00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:37.675
It can also vibrate like this.

00:37:38.739 --> 00:37:40.030
I wish I had a different color.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.497
Over here?

00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:42.997
Great.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.030
OK.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:56.930
You can also have the
string vibrate like this.

00:37:59.265 --> 00:37:59.765
OK.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.010
And it can vibrate in many,
many different patterns.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.700
I've just drawn a few.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.580
What's interesting is
that this length is twice

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:15.990
as long as this length, which
is twice as long as this length.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.150
And what would you expect the
time of those vibrations to be?

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.920
Well, the big long thing is
going to vibrate pretty slowly.

00:38:26.592 --> 00:38:28.550
That's what's called the
fundamental frequency.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.970
The thing that's vibrating
in two parts, it's shorter

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.175
and it can vibrate faster.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.000
In fact, it vibrates
twice as fast.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
So the first harmonic
is twice the frequency

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.040
of the fundamental,
and so on and so forth.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.820
You can get from the
physical characteristics

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.710
of the vibration of that
string a whole bunch

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.320
of different vibration patterns.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.120
And they're usually a harmonic
series-- twice, three times,

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.880
four times, five times, six
times-- the fundamental,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.630
just because of the physical
characteristics of vibration

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:14.320
of the string, and
the wind column

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.260
in the case of an
Alto saxophone.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:23.730
When you hear that one
note hit by the hammer,

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:27.110
all of these vibrations
are happening at once.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.910
And so that one sound
sounds like one thing.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:38.527
Musicians will say it sounds
like a note-- A above C.

00:39:38.527 --> 00:39:40.860
But you have a whole bunch
of different harmonics in it.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.000
What is pitch?

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:51.490
Pitch is very
interesting to people

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.320
who study the auditory
system, to musicians.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.520
Pitch is that attribute of the
sensation, auditory sensation,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.580
in terms of which sounds can
be ordered on a musical scale.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.300
Let's say I didn't let
you see the keyboard,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.910
but I recorded the sounds, and
I press some sounds down there,

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.870
some in the middle, some way up
here, some way at the high end,

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.145
and I gave you 20
different recordings,

00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:21.040
and I said, well, make
a ranking of them.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.300
Put these down low.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.680
Those are number one and two.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.470
Put these in the
middle-- those are number

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.810
10-- up to the high end.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.390
The highest one is 20.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.435
You could do that.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.740
The ones that were
down low would

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.350
be called those with low pitch.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.120
The pitch of a pure
tone, of course,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.080
depends on the frequency.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.240
That's as if you
were just giving one.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.870
If you move that around,
up high end frequency,

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.020
it sounds like a really
shrilly, high-pitched sound.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.430
If you move it down low, it
sounds like a real low sound.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.280
The pitch of a complicated
sound-- that is,

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.150
with many overtones
and harmonics--

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.170
depends strongly on the
fundamental frequency.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:09.150
But sometimes, the fundamental--
for example, in this guitar

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.135
sound-- is pretty weak.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.220
And in some cases, you can
take it out altogether.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.640
The pitch doesn't change
that much, surprisingly.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.835
So somehow, the ear knows
by this pattern of spectrum

00:41:21.835 --> 00:41:23.960
that there should be a
fundamental [INAUDIBLE] that

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.834
can stick it back in.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.140
So that's what pitch is.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.210
Another sensation that
musicians often talk about

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.050
is the timbre of a sound.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:38.295
And the timbre is the quality or
the identification of a sound.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.060
It relates to the
highest harmonics here

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.340
and the pattern
of this harmonics.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.610
For the piano, it's starting
big and sloping down.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.050
For a guitar, it's
starting small, sloping up,

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.130
and then sloping down.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:58.210
The timbre is what allows you
to identify that sound that you

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.270
heard as a piano.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.062
We can all hear a piano
and say, that's a piano.

00:42:02.062 --> 00:42:04.145
We can all hear a guitar
and say, that's a guitar,

00:42:04.145 --> 00:42:06.960
or that's an electric
guitar, because its pattern

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.220
of harmonics, its fundamental
harmonics, differs.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.210
That's how we identify
sounds is by their timbre

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.960
or their spectrum, if you will.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.410
Those are pretty
complicated sounds.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.150
What do I have next?

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.108
I have a demonstration.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.590
This one is called
Canceled Harmonics.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.340
And it's a very
nice demonstration

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.370
to illustrate the
idea that I said,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:42.350
when you have all these
harmonics go on together,

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:46.449
it sounds like one thing,
one note, one sound.

00:42:46.449 --> 00:42:47.990
But if you take some
of the harmonics

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:53.220
out and put them back
in, you're aware of that

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.680
taking out and putting back in.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.530
So what they're going
to do is a complex tone

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.510
is presented, followed
by several cancellations

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:07.210
and restorations of a
particular harmonic.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.477
And let me show you
what complex tones

00:43:09.477 --> 00:43:10.560
they're going to give you.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.925
It's simply this square wave.

00:43:16.986 --> 00:43:18.860
This is what you're
going to be listening to.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.401
It sounds like
[MAKES BUZZING NOISE].

00:43:20.401 --> 00:43:22.060
It's not very musical at all.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.830
And it has a fundamental
and a whole bunch

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.490
of harmonics, an
infinite number.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.850
When that complex goes on at
once, you're going to say,

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.730
that sounds like a nasty sound.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.165
It sounds like a buzz almost.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:44.150
Then they're going to take this
one harmonic and pull it out,

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.960
and then they're going
to put it back in.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.999
As they do that,
you're going to say,

00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:50.290
well, that sounded differently.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.510
When it was out and
when it was back in,

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.390
I could hear that
thing going in and out.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:58.600
And then they're going to do
that for the second, third,

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.340
and fourth on up to, I
think about 10 or so.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.470
Even though this
whole constellation

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:09.920
sounds like one sound, when they
pulse these things in and out,

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.740
you can tell.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.410
Let's listen to
the demonstration,

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.800
and let's see how many times
they're going to do it.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.255
This is done for
harmonics one through ten.

00:44:26.855 --> 00:44:28.322
Canceled Harmonics.

00:44:28.322 --> 00:44:31.010
A complex tone is
presented, followed

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.160
by several cancellations
and restorations

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.136
of a particular harmonic.

00:44:36.136 --> 00:44:39.594
This is done for
harmonics one through 10.

00:46:05.502 --> 00:46:06.030
OK.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.330
Could everybody hear when
this complex went on all at

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.780
once it sounded like one sound?

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.600
Then when individual components
were taken out and pulsed back

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.490
in, you could identify them.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.640
Your ear is very good
at distinguishing

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.825
the various frequencies
in a complex spectrum.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.360
All that message is sent to the
brain as individual channels,

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.920
and the brain somehow
perceives that when everything

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.910
is going on at the same
time, that's one sound.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.610
It's really not of
interest to the brain

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.270
that the string is
vibrating a whole bunch

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.090
of different frequencies.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.985
It's that there's
one string vibrating.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.550
But if you took out one of
these modes-- in other words,

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:50.420
if I put my finger here and
the fundamental goes away,

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.350
you ear is very good
at detecting that.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.170
And it sends a
message to the brain

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.970
that the fundamental
is no longer there.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.178
And the brain says, something
different has happened.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.700
So the ear is very
good at recognizing

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.260
those different characteristics.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.720
The brain is good at putting
them back together and saying,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.194
they started at one
time, so it's one object.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:14.680
Questions about that so far?

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:24.920
Now, the last type of complex
sound that I want to cover

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.040
is speech sounds.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.530
And I want to save most of this
for the end of the semester

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:34.700
when we talk about the parts
of the auditory system that

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.220
are active in distinguishing
different speech sounds.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.140
But let me just-- because
we're talking about sounds

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.520
and complex sounds, talk
about speech sounds.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.730
This is a diagram of
your vocal cavity.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.530
Way down at the bottom
here, you get air

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.410
from your lungs that goes
through your trachea.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.430
And in the trachea, there's
these vocal cords, if you will,

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.190
that are scientifically
called the glottis.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.890
The opening in between
is the glottis.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.670
So air can come out, or if
you use muscles associated

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.910
with your vocal cords,
you can close that off.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:21.010
As the air comes out from here,
it moves those vocal cords

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.230
back and forth.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.540
And they hit each
other, and they open up,

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.060
and they hit each
other and open up.

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:30.210
And as they do that, they
interrupt the airflow

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.642
and they allow it
to pass through.

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:34.100
And they interrupt it, and they
allowed it to pass through.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.720
And if you were to
put a microphone

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.340
way down your trachea right
above those vocal cords,

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.980
you would see this
time waveform.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:50.340
The pressure would go up right
as the air pressure is coming

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.650
from the lungs when the
vocal cords were open.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.620
When the vocal cords are shut,
there's no pressure there,

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.580
or it's just
atmospheric pressure.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.210
So this opening and closing
of the air through the glottis

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.450
forms this very
complicated waveform.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.344
If you look at the
spectrum of it,

00:49:11.344 --> 00:49:13.260
it has a whole bunch of
different frequencies.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.890
The lowest of the
frequencies is the frequency

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.050
that these things are
opening and closing.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.180
But there's a whole
bunch of harmonics.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.675
It's a very
complicated spectrum.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.620
The upper part of
your vocal tract

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.820
is what's called the filter.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.180
And it serves to emphasize
some of those harmonics

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.715
and de-emphasize others.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.070
And the filter function
is indicated here

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:42.765
having three peaks.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:46.130
Those peaks are
called formant peaks.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.090
They have to do with the
shape and dimensions, lengths

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:06.310
and widths of your
upper vocal tract.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:10.980
What's kind of neat is by
manipulating, let's say,

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:15.320
where your palate is,
and where your lips are,

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:19.160
and where your tongue is, you
can change that filter function

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.350
by using the muscles
that move things around

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:24.000
in your upper vocal tract.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.600
And after you've filtered
this complex spectrum,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.780
you come out with
a function where

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.560
some of these spectral
peaks are emphasized

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.077
and some are not emphasized.

00:50:36.077 --> 00:50:37.660
And here's the
function that you would

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.990
get right outside in the
air outside the front

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.400
of your mouth.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.045
This is the time wave form here.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.140
Here are some examples
of manipulation

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.480
of your upper vocal tract.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.720
For instance, here the
lower part of the mouth

00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:01.310
is moved way up high, and it
produces an acoustic spectrum

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.600
where you have a big f1.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.630
And f2 and f3 are
small, and they

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.080
are way up high in frequency.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:15.560
Contrast this with when
the bottom of your mouth

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.370
is lowered and moved backward.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.160
Here, F1 is even lower.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.500
F2 is quite low.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.330
And F3 is moderately low.

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:27.100
And these are, of
course, the way

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.860
you pronounce different vowels.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.300
We can all say these two vowels.

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.640
This is the vowel
"i" as in "hit."

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.640
Everybody say that-- hit, hit.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.790
You can kind of feel that
the lower part of your mouth

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.400
is moved upward.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.544
Whereas if you do something
like this-- "a" in call.

00:51:50.544 --> 00:51:52.120
Call-- everybody say that.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.120
Call.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.930
You can feel the lower
part of your mouth

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:59.690
dropping down as indicated
here in making a big cavity,

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.110
whereas here the
cavity is very small.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.090
It changes the
acoustic spectrum.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:05.510
Our ears pick it up.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.960
And our ears are very
good frequency analyzers.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.730
And they say the spectrum here
sounds like hit, because you've

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.830
learned to associate that
spectrum with that vowel.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.220
This is a different spectrum.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.970
Our ears pick it
up and they say,

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:25.580
that's the vowel
"a" as in "call."

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.300
That's how speech
sounds are formed.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:33.010
At least this works very
well for vowel sounds.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:37.280
It doesn't explain things
like consonant sounds, which

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.220
of course are many
different kinds.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:42.520
There's stop consonants
where your lips close down

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.570
before you utter
the consonant "p."

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:49.220
So "p," everybody
close their lips down,

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.124
and then all of the
sudden you open it up.

00:52:51.124 --> 00:52:52.540
It's a completely
different thing.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.860
That's not modulating
the spectrum.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.420
That's modulating
the time pattern.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.500
These vowels are
distinguished by

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.520
their different
spectral patterns,

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.530
which is picked
up by your years.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.850
So I just thought you'd
want to know about that.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:11.420
Speech sounds are among the most
complicated acoustical sounds

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.420
because of the number
of frequencies involved,

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.320
the formation, and of
course the perception

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.850
of telling, for example,
one vowel from another.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.240
Let's shift gears and move on.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.730
And instead of talking about
the physical characteristics

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.240
of sound, let's talk
about how we hear sounds.

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.280
We're only going to get as
far as the auditory periphery

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.820
today, but let's just define it.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:47.260
The auditory periphery is this
whole structure indicated here,

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.230
and it's usually separated
into three parts--

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:58.190
the external ear, the middle
ear, and then the inner ear.

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:01.910
Those are the three
very big divisions

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:03.610
of the auditory periphery.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.625
In the external ear,
you have your pinna.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.730
Here's your pinna.

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.030
You have the ear
canal, which goes down

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.190
about three centimeters
inside your head,

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:18.020
and it ends up at this
yellow structure here called

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.370
the ear drum.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:22.190
Tympanic membrane is
the scientific term

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.010
for the ear drum.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.000
That's the end of
the external ear.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.810
The middle ear is an
air-filled cavity.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:34.860
So we're still talking
about sound in the ear.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:38.930
In that middle ear cavity
are three small bones.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.130
They're called ossicles.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:43.640
I think-- yeah, here we go.

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.930
And in high school
biology, you probably

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:52.410
learned them as hammer,
anvil, and stirrup.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:57.070
But the scientific names are
malleus, incus, and stapes.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:05.030
And they convey these sound
vibrations of the ear drum.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:08.230
When sound hits the ear
drum, it causes it to move.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:12.460
And these bones are linked
right onto the eardrum,

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.925
and they're linked
one to another.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:18.030
The ear drum then
moves the bones,

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:22.390
and the bones finally end up,
in the case of the stapes,

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.624
in the inner ear.

00:55:23.624 --> 00:55:25.165
So that's where the
inner ear begins.

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:30.380
I have a demonstration
of ossicles,

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:33.700
and I'll pass them around.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.880
These are ossicles
from a guinea pig,

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.090
and they're glued to the
bottom of this little vial.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.510
And I made a crummy
drawing of them.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:49.190
But if you hold this vial so
that the piece of tape on it

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:53.380
is downward, you
get this view here.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.240
You have the stapes.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.270
And I didn't list
the other ones.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:07.170
But in the guinea pig,
the incus and malleus

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:10.010
are fused, so they
can be considered one.

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.150
This is definitely
part of the malleus.

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:22.670
But I don't know where the incus
ends and the malleus begins.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:27.010
If you had an ear drum, it
would be this dashed line here.

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:33.590
So let me just
pass these around.

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:39.900
And you can probably
appreciate from my diagram

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.700
how the high school biology name
for the stapes got its name.

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.849
It's the stirrup.

00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:46.640
What's the stirrup?

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:55.390
Does anybody know
what a stirrup is?

00:56:56.781 --> 00:56:57.280
Yeah.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.972
When you ride
horses, what is the--

00:56:58.972 --> 00:57:00.388
AUDIENCE: You put
your foot in it.

00:57:00.388 --> 00:57:02.460
PROFESSOR: You put
your foot in it.

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:06.510
And that's why cowboy
boots have a nice big heel,

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.950
so your foot doesn't go
all the way through it.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:09.920
It sticks in your heel.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:13.270
So this is the stirrup.

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:15.850
You put your cowboy
boot right in there

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:18.130
until your heel hits
this foot plate.

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.740
That's pretty obvious
how that got its name.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.095
It's the foot plate
where you put your foot.

00:57:31.095 --> 00:57:32.360
Your foot goes right on that.

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:35.980
And that foot plate
is the beginning

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.750
of the next division,
which is the inner ear.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.510
And by the way, I
should point out

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:47.935
before I forget-- what is the
smallest bone in the body?

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:51.260
All answers are given.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.840
The stapes is the
smallest bone in the body.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.632
Why?

00:57:56.632 --> 00:57:57.340
It's got to move.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:01.380
And the lousy little sound--
it's this tiny little ear drum.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.090
Remember, the ear
drum is basically

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.940
a tiny, little
thin piece of skin.

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.080
It's like Saran wrap.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:13.640
When your doctor looks
down your ear canal,

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.500
that doctor can look right
through the ear drum.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.990
It's so thin.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:19.870
It's like plastic wrap.

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:23.930
The doctor can look into
the middle ear and say,

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:25.670
so much fluid in there.

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:27.700
You've got a middle
ear infection.

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.251
Or they can say,
middle ear looks good.

00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:31.500
You've got some other problem.

00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:33.800
That's what we're looking at.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.930
They're looking with their
otoscope and a light right

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.130
through the ear drum
into the middle ear.

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:43.380
And that whole middle
ear drum and the ossicles

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:47.985
have to vibrate when there's
a tiny little sound like a pin

00:58:47.985 --> 00:58:48.485
drop.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.710
The pin drops right
there, and you can hear it

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.890
because these things are so
light and flexible that they

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.095
can vibrate-- and so small.

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.550
The stapes foot plate
ends up at the cochlear.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:11.530
And the cochlear is the
main part of the inner ear.

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:16.670
And cochlear, as it
says here, gets its name

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:20.090
from the Greek word
kochlias, which means snail.

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:25.870
And certainly, the inner ear
looks like a snail shell.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:30.710
And in the inner
ear, here's where

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:35.675
sound changes from sound in air,
or maybe sound in the bones.

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.605
The inner ear is
filled with fluid.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.840
And inside the inner ear are
these wonderful receptor cells

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.304
for hearing and the beginning
of the auditory nerve.

01:00:05.304 --> 01:00:06.970
Here's the auditory
nerve that's sending

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.110
messages centrally
into the brain.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.980
So the brain would be
beginning right here.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.550
This whole structure
here, all this gray stuff,

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.223
and even the shell of
the cochlear is bone.

01:00:19.223 --> 01:00:21.800
And it's your temporal bone.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.280
The temporal bone is the
hardest bone in the body.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.890
You can have a severe
blow to the head

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.580
and that temporal bone will keep
all these structures intact.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.920
It's very, very hard bone.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.200
Surgeons at our
hospital do a lot

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.757
of drilling with
the dental drill.

01:00:39.757 --> 01:00:41.590
They get down to these
important structures,

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:44.350
because they have
to manipulate them.

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:47.400
These loops here are
part of the inner ear,

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.060
but they are part that is
sensitive to vestibular

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.560
sensation.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.070
So those loops are called
the semicircular canals.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.160
They are almost circular.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.670
They are in the three
planes, X, Y, and Z.

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:05.850
And when you rotate your
head, let's say, side to side,

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:09.500
one of those can move.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:15.930
And the receptor cells in
it can sense that movement

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.450
and detect that
your head had moved.

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:20.430
And it's very important,
because if you

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:22.900
want to keep your eyes
fixated on one point

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.200
but move your head,
you can do that

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.615
by the vestibulo-ocular reflex.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:32.610
The neurons from this
the vestibular system

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:34.770
send messages into
the brain stem,

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:37.450
and eventually they go
through coordinating centers

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:42.070
into the motor neurons for
the extraocular muscles, which

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:45.030
can, of course, move
your eyes when you want

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:48.710
to do a [? secade ?]
or pursuit, or they

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:52.050
can keep your eyes stabilized,
which is moving them

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.090
with respect your head even
though your head is moving.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.372
But we're not going
to talk about those.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.330
Let's talk about the
function of the middle ear

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:09.400
and the external ear.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.899
That's what we're going to talk
about for the rest of today.

01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:12.892
I have a model.

01:02:12.892 --> 01:02:14.350
Let me just pass
around this model.

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:18.200
I think we passed around before
on the first day of class,

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.140
but you can look at it
again, because we're

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.850
going into more detail
today on this structure.

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:25.630
This comes apart.

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:26.890
Here's your pinna.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:28.045
Here's the long ear canal.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.820
Here's the ear drum.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:38.670
And if I tilt this here,
you can see the structures

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:42.550
we're talking about in the
inner ear-- the cochlear,

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:46.770
the semicircular canals, and
this yellow structure here

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.925
is the auditory nerve.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.370
It's been going into the brain.

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:52.700
The brain is cut off here.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:57.790
This is the
eustachian tube, which

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:04.220
is a way to vent the
air-filled middle ear.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.200
So you want to
purge that with air.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.850
If you go up hiking
in a tall mountain,

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:12.030
the barometric pressure
outside gets lower.

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:13.950
You want to equalize
that in your middle ear.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.625
You open that eustachian
tube, usually by swallowing.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.680
The ossicles are here.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.090
And if you take
out this inner ear,

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:26.000
the stapes is fixed with it.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.120
So you can see the stapes.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:33.860
In terms of size, this whole
inner ear-- the cochlear

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.370
is about the size of an
aspirin tablet in a human.

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.500
It's about that size.

01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:41.416
OK.

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:42.853
Let's pass that around.

01:03:48.981 --> 01:03:49.480
OK.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.390
What is the function
of the middle ear?

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:54.966
Why do we have
these three bones?

01:03:54.966 --> 01:03:56.090
Why do we have the eardrum?

01:03:56.090 --> 01:04:00.321
Why doesn't sound come right
in and strike the inner ear

01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:00.820
itself?

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.520
Well, it turns out
that if you look

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:13.590
at the physical characteristics
of sound in air,

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:17.100
and you want to get
that airborne sound

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.900
to sound in water,
different medium.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.375
So this is fluid or water.

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:25.125
This is air.

01:04:27.179 --> 01:04:28.720
Sound is coming in
here, and you want

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.490
to get it into the fluid of the
inner ear, which is essentially

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:33.990
water.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.430
If you don't do anything and you
have the sound coming in here,

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:42.440
most of it bounces back off.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:52.320
In fact, 99.5% of
the energy of sound

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.020
in air at a fluid boundary is
reflected back into the air.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:04.210
So if you're in a
boat here-- I didn't

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:08.700
draw this right-- you're in
a boat here, you're fishing,

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.980
you're talking to your buddy
in the back of the boat

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.950
and you say, pass me another
beer, and your buddy says,

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:19.420
be quiet, you'll scare
the fish-- actually,

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.650
the fish can't hear you.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:27.230
Because most of the energy in
your saying "pass me a beer"

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:29.200
bounced right back
off into the air.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:35.910
So how does the auditory
system deal with this?

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:41.690
We want to listen very
carefully to a pin drop,

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:45.030
but most of the energy
bounces back off

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:48.760
at this boundary
between air and fluid.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.320
That's the job of
the middle ear.

01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:59.630
Here is how the
middle ear moves.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:02.680
This is a nice movie
made by Heidi Nakajima

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.700
at Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.500
This orientation is a
little bit different,

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.740
but this is the ear drum.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:13.080
This is the malleus, the
incus, and the stapes.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.790
Together, they're
the middle ear.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.940
I said this inner ear
is the cochlear here,

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.490
and it's encased in bone--
fluid encased in bone.

01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:28.710
So how does this stapes work?

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.240
Well, there's a little
window in the bone.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.170
It's called the oval window.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:44.816
And the foot plate of the stapes
pushes on that oval window.

01:06:44.816 --> 01:06:46.190
It's not indicated
here, but it's

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:47.665
right underneath this oval part.

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.940
There's another window
called the round window.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.820
That's indicated by blue there.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.850
And it's just a
pressure relief point,

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:06.490
because if you pushed on fluid,
it would push back to you.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.193
Fluid is relatively
incompressible.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:14.070
So this pushing in means this
membrane over the round window

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:15.700
can push out easily.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.240
So it's easy to push
in and pull back,

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.720
because this membrane can give.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.740
As you can see, the
motion of these bones

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.660
is coming into the
fluid quite nicely

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.990
and changing some membranes
inside the inner ear.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:37.470
The job of the middle ear is so
that most of that sound energy

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:43.430
gets into the fluids of
the water of the inner ear.

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:45.020
How does it do that?

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.930
The primary way is
by changing area.

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:56.520
The eardrum is this big drum,
and the stapes foot plate

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.630
is this much lower in
area or smaller structure.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.455
And there's some formulas here.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:12.920
p1, a1, those pressure and
area at the tympanic membrane,

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.410
equals p2 a2 where the same
characteristics at the stapes

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:19.149
foot plate.

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:27.569
So when you decrease the
area a lot, a2 goes way down.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.560
p2 has to go way up.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:36.080
So that's then the main
way that the middle ear

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.270
allows sound and air to
go into sound and fluid.

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:45.916
The engineers would call
this impedance matching.

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:57.810
And they would say that
when you change media,

01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.720
the impedance of one medium
being different from another

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.479
means that most of the energy
is going to bounce back off.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:09.130
If you have a device
here like the middle ear

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:14.040
to make the impedances more
matching, much of this energy

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.689
is going to then go through
the boundary from one

01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:19.910
medium to the other if
you match the impedances.

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:21.770
And one way of
matching the impedances

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:23.910
is to change the areas.

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:29.270
Another way-- and this may
be the reason we have three

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:33.989
and not just one middle ear
bone-- is by a lever action.

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:38.819
So this is kind of like a
lever where the fulcrum is off

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:41.420
to one side, not
right in the middle.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.990
And you can obviously
get force amplification

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:45.405
from a lever action.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:50.470
A third mechanism
might be a buckling

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:51.795
of the tympanic membrane.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.090
And you'll have to read-- I'm
not an expert on that at all.

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:59.750
I'm not even sure if that's
even in vogue these days.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:03.970
But these actions are
much less than the change

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.830
in area offered by the eardrum.

01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:13.570
So what happens when a patient
comes into the Massachusetts

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:16.720
Eye and Ear Infirmary,
and for some reason,

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.710
either via an accident or
a developmental problem,

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:24.240
they don't have an
eardrum, and they

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.640
don't have these three ossicles.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.940
So the sound goes right
in from the outside

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.720
and strikes, let's say, the
round window of the cochlear.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.120
Are they deaf?

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.650
Well, no.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:38.080
They have a hearing loss.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.400
Some of the energy gets
through into the fluid.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.060
How big is their hearing loss?

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.290
Well, this is the
so-called audiogram

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:52.450
that's generated when
you visit a hospital

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.710
and you complain that your
hearing isn't so good.

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:57.470
They send you down to
the Audiology Department.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.720
They put you in a testing booth.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.280
They put earphones on, and
the tester goes outside

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.590
so they don't make
any extraneous noise.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:13.270
And they say, raise your hand
when you can hear a sound.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:16.810
So they test your hearing-- this
is the so-called audiogram--

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:20.160
and plot it on the
y-axis as the amount

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.300
of hearing loss in decibels.

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:27.150
It's just the way they plot it.

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.790
And plot it on the
x-axis as the frequency.

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:35.720
And they typically
test 2,550, 1,000--

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.350
which is abbreviated
here 1k-- 2k, and 4k.

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.850
They typically don't test the
extremes of the human hearing.

01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:46.280
They test the middle range.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:51.630
This is the range over which
most speech sounds are made.

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:54.250
And that's the most
important for most people.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:56.200
When they say, I
can't hear very well,

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.890
it means they can't understand
somebody when they're speaking.

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:02.530
And this is the
audiogram from someone

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:04.620
who lacked a middle ear.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:09.150
And this 40 dB here-- across
all the different frequencies,

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:11.860
approximately 40 db-- is
the amount of hearing loss

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.360
they have.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.680
So if you go back
to the audiogram

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.370
that we had in the first
slide of today's lecture,

01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:21.270
everything would be
lifted up by 40 dB.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.500
You have a 40 dB hearing loss.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.420
You're not deaf
at all, but that's

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.670
a moderate to severe hearing
loss, a 40 dB hearing loss.

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:35.500
You might have
problems-- you certainly

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.000
would have problems
hearing a pin drop.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.400
You might have problems
hearing a telephone ring

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.500
if it were on the
other side of the room.

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:48.563
You might have problems
with conversation.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:54.390
A treatment to that would be
several types of treatment.

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:57.580
The surgeons in the Ear,
Nose, and Throat Department

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.200
at Mass Eye and Ear
could reconstruct

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.820
your middle ear
and your eardrum.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.510
They could use a skin
flap, a piece of skin taken

01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:08.490
from somewhere
else on your body,

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:10.130
put it in the place
of the eardrum.

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:15.200
They could use some either wire
or Teflon or plastic pieces

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.510
that could connect that
eardrum into the oval window

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:21.220
of the cochlear.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:26.879
So they can reconstruct the
middle ear fairly easily.

01:13:26.879 --> 01:13:28.670
If the person doesn't
want to have surgery,

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.310
they can have a hearing aid.

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:35.390
Essentially, you have a
flat frequency loss here.

01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:37.470
So put a device in
the ear canal that

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:43.850
boosts every single frequency
by 40 dB, amplify the sound.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:47.000
So a hearing aid
works pretty well

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.750
for these people with this
type of a hearing loss.

01:13:49.750 --> 01:14:00.490
This type of a hearing loss
is called a conductive hearing

01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:04.420
loss, because it's in
the conductive mechanism

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.060
to conduct the sound
from outside your body

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.350
into the inside of your body.

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:10.780
It's a conductive hearing loss.

01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:14.645
So that is the job
of the middle ear--

01:14:14.645 --> 01:14:18.150
to ensure efficient
transmission of sound

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:20.410
in air into the
fluids of your body.

01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:22.881
And without it, you have a
moderate to severe hearing

01:14:22.881 --> 01:14:23.380
loss.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.290
There's a disease
called otosclerosis.

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:46.752
"Oto" meaning hearing.

01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:52.490
My department at
Harvard Med School

01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:54.520
is otology and laryngology.

01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.310
Otology and laryngology.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.550
And sclerosis means hardening
or rocky or bony growths.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.980
And the surgery that
happens-- sometimes

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.170
around the stapes, bony
growths can grow around it

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:21.480
and fix the foot plate so
that it can't vibrate anymore.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.720
So what's done for that is
you take out the stapes,

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.710
you take off the bony
growths, and if you just

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:33.760
put the stapes back in, often
these bony growths grow again.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.910
So actually you take
it out and replace it

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.780
with an artificial stapes.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.015
And the operation is
called a stapedectomy.

01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:49.230
The "stape" and "ectomy"
means taking it out.

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:51.770
You replace it
with a prosthesis.

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:56.020
It's a very successful
surgery for otosclerosis,

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.700
which is a conductive
hearing loss.

01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:01.560
That's the job of
the middle ear,

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.190
and that's relatively easy to
treat when there's a problem.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:12.110
Is there a function
of the external ear?

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:17.980
Well, a lot of textbooks say the
external ear funnels the sound

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.075
into your ear canal.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.320
But there is another function
of the external ear that's

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:32.050
more on the lines of localizing
sounds using your external ear.

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:36.920
These are examples of
external ears-- our pinna.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.070
Everybody has a
slightly different one.

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:42.688
Who is this historical figure?

01:16:42.688 --> 01:16:43.188
Anybody?

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.490
He was a president
of the United States.

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:54.600
LBJ, President Johnson.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:59.220
He was always caricatured by
the political cartoon guys

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:02.707
with these huge
ears, big pinnae.

01:17:02.707 --> 01:17:04.290
Everybody has different
shaped pinnae.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:10.820
It turns out that the external
ear can help you localize

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.140
where sound is coming from.

01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:15.895
Well, how can it do that?

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:20.930
Well, if you have
a pinna and you

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:36.270
do this interesting experiment--
you take a microphone

01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:38.820
and put the microphone
inside here.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.795
So here's the pinna.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.290
Here's the ear canal.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.200
Put the microphone out
here, and start out

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.565
with a completely flat
spectrum, broadband noise.

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:55.810
The noise is absolutely
flat so that it

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:58.040
has equal energy at
all the frequencies.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.110
You measure it out there, and
then you move your microphone

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:09.130
down here in the ear canal,
maybe near the eardrum ,

01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:12.120
and measure the spectrum again.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.830
So this is plotted
in terms of gain

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:19.250
with respect to free field.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.540
Free field is out here.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.860
Free field means basically in
the room or in the environment.

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:32.000
Now we're going to
measure the spectrum down

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.150
here and plot the gain.

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:39.080
So anything above 0 is going
to be higher than in the ear,

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.270
and everything below 0
is going to be lower.

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:47.450
Let's look at this
solid curve here,

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:50.690
which is minus 15
degrees elevation.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:56.590
Elevation of a sound source-- if
it's straight ahead, it's zero.

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:59.725
If it's minus 15, it's
15 degrees below zero.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:04.510
If it's above zero, it
could be 15 degrees.

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:06.730
On this case, it's 7.5 and 30.

01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:09.360
So elevations that are
positive are above you.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.640
As that sound
source moves around

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:19.630
from being below you to above
you, its spectrum changes,

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:21.780
the spectrum way down
here at the ear drum.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:27.200
And in particular, there
are some very sharp dips

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.705
or nulls in the spectrum
that move around.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.860
It's thought that you can
use those nulls as a cue

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.530
to where this sound is.

01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:41.870
Now, what causes those nulls?

01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:46.390
Well, because the pinna
is very complicated,

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:51.640
you can imagine that some sound
comes in and strikes the pinna

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.490
and reflects off it.

01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:56.960
And maybe it reflects--
excuse my artistic abilities

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.770
here-- maybe it reflects
into the ear canal.

01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:05.260
Contrast that with other
sound that comes straight in.

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:10.640
Eventually, these two sounds
are going to meet up at a point.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.650
And let's say this sound
taking a longer time path

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:17.780
went through half of its cycle.

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:22.230
So now this sound,
when it's starting

01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.360
to go a negative
pressure, meets up

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:28.290
with this sound, which came
straight in and is starting

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.450
to go in a positive pressure.

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:33.165
Positive plus negative
could sum to zero.

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.990
And the geometry has
to be just right,

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:39.540
and the frequency
has to be just right.

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.700
But it can be just right
at a particular frequency,

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.230
and that's what
causes the nulls.

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:46.480
It's just a physical
characteristic

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.160
of two sound sources meeting up.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.580
It is thought,
then, that you can

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.060
learn the position
of those nulls,

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:59.830
especially, to be associated
with positions of sound

01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:00.690
in space.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:04.399
And that's what was done in the
researchers' report for today.

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:11.685
These are some data from
four different subjects.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:17.230
They tested the
subject to localize

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:20.180
sounds coming from
in front of them.

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.570
Left and right would be azimuth.

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:24.350
That's plotted on the x-axis.

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:28.728
Up and down would be elevation.

01:21:28.728 --> 01:21:29.936
That's plotted on the y-axis.

01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:35.660
And they move to sounds
around to different places,

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.150
and they said to
the person, tell me

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:39.910
where the sound is coming from.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.720
The answers that
the subjects gave

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.680
are in these solid, thick lines.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.180
The real positions were
on the thinner lines.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.830
And each big individual data
points are the small points,

01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:57.990
and the average data
points from the subject

01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:59.370
are the big points here.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:05.880
So these subjects, when given
a checkerboard of locations,

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:11.210
they could pretty faithfully
tell the investigators

01:22:11.210 --> 01:22:13.990
where a sound was coming
from, both in elevation

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.770
and in azimuth.

01:22:16.007 --> 01:22:17.840
These are data from
four different subjects.

01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:23.427
What was done in the experiment
is distort the pinna.

01:22:23.427 --> 01:22:24.510
How are we going to do it?

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:27.800
Well, we could move
our ear a little bit.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.620
What they did was they
put in a little clay

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.997
mold in parts of the
pinna to change the shape,

01:22:33.997 --> 01:22:35.330
and they did that on both sides.

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:40.510
As soon as they did
that, these are now

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:41.840
the answers from the subjects.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:47.840
Terrible in terms of
elevation sensitivity,

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.510
determining where
a sound is coming

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.980
from in terms of
different elevations.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.350
Still pretty good in azimuth.

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.490
There are other queues
for sound azimuth

01:22:57.490 --> 01:23:00.250
that involve using
two ears, which we're

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:02.490
going to talk about extensively
later this semester.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.670
The elevational
localization was completely

01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:10.170
disrupted when the pinna
shape was disrupted.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.540
Have these subjects go out for
a few weeks, come back, get

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:16.380
tested again.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:21.210
They re-learned
with the pinna molds

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:24.905
in how to localize sounds.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.340
This is an example of
re-learning or plasticity.

01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:35.030
Now the pinna cues
had different nulls

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:36.900
because the pinnas were
shaped differently.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.940
They could re-learn
these new cues

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.170
and associate them with the
same old changes in elevation

01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:44.470
that we had before.

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:47.650
So that's why it's called
re-learning sound localization

01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:50.970
with new ears or new
or distorted ears.

01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:56.790
So this is an example
then, of subjects learning

01:23:56.790 --> 01:24:01.240
to associate these new cues
with the old sound localization

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.420
positions.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:11.400
So that's the take home message
from this research report

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:17.830
OK questions I can also
do I get on Wednesday,

01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:21.020
we'll talk about the inner ear.

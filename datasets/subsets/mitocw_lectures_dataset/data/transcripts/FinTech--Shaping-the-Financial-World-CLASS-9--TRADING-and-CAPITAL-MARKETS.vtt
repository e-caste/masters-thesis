00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.520
GARY GENSLER: Welcome
back to FinTech,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.140
Shaping the World of Finance.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.980
Today, we're going to
review developments

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.130
in finance and technology
related to capital markets.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.490
And since there's so many
pieces with capital markets,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.170
I've chosen to take the time
to dig more deeply into two

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.120
areas, online brokerage,
or really mobile brokerage

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.460
applications, and wealth
advising through robo advising.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.340
But we'll touch upon the broader
capital markets as well as

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.290
a little touch on
cryptocurrencies

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.430
because some of the most
successful financial technology

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.320
companies in the capital
markets have actually

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.270
been crypto exchanges
and some of the endeavors

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.550
around crypto markets.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.660
So if I just take a moment just
to share my screen and share

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:23.070
some slides, and
we'll get going here.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.470
Online brokerage, this
is not a new tradition.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.520
It goes back actually
several decades.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100
And so then the
question is, what's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.350
happened here in the
last six or eight years?

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.450
What's happened that this
startup Robinhood and others

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.360
have really just toppled
over the last remaining

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.680
bits of the commission
structure that we've had?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.650
Robo advising and
then capital markets,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.360
FinTech startups more generally.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.990
We'll have to do a quick
survey there and then

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.910
a little discussion
of what's happening

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.975
in crypto exchanges and
decentralized finance,

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:02.350
because it's really
the question,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.080
will that actually
transform finance,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.840
or will it stay as
it is right now,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.190
a more narrow niche, though,
still a $200 billion asset

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.590
class environment?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.360
But will some of
those technologies

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.780
come into mainstream finance?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.690
So the readings
again were mostly

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.320
focused around those
two areas, robo advising

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.190
and online brokerage, and
how Robinhood has transformed

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.810
the industry, and how Charles
Schwab and others entered

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.820
into by the late part of 2019
what some call the New Broker

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.450
Wars, in part because of
this financial technology

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.040
along the way.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.340
So just some lively questions
but a way to get us going here.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.600
And hopefully somebody
wants to chime in.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.290
How did online brokers
emerge during an earlier

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.320
FinTech development
period, during the '80s,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.650
'90s, that sort of
internet technology,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.170
FinTech technology area?

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.600
And then how Robinhood's
transformed maybe

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.390
this more recent era.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.180
Romain, does anybody
want to dive in at all?

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.020
ROMAIN: Let's see.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.940
Who will be the first
volunteer today?

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.098
GARY GENSLER: I mean,
everybody, we'll be talking

00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:23.390
about this for the whole class.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.750
But I just-- if anybody wants to
offer their thoughts to start.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.100
ROMAIN: And we have Michael.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.320
So when I think the
earlier FinTech startups,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.305
I think just thinking
of edge of the internet.

00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:43.030
I'm thinking like
PayPal, just ways

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.370
you can do online payments
and online interfaces for--

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.730
or sorry, not online brokers.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.500
I'm thinking of E*TRADE, but
ways to make it without having

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.782
to call somebody on the phone.

00:03:55.782 --> 00:03:58.240
I guess it was probably more
inaccessible when you actually

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.460
had to drive to the broker
directly or in-person.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.640
Robinhood definitely
was more starting

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.590
to take the mobile-first
approach, started

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.450
tackling weaknesses of
the larger platforms,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.950
such as user interface, make
it more accessible for somebody

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.642
to really just
trade from anywhere.

00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:19.600
And then also the fee
structure was a huge part

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.440
of that, too, for trading.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.480
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.260
But I'm glad--

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.240
I'm actually glad
Michael raised PayPal,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.720
because there's
analogies, and that's

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.500
what this class is really about.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.000
It's finding what's happening
from a strategic point of view.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.090
We're teaching finance,
technology, the intersection

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.560
but about the strategies.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.690
And there's a lot of parallel.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.400
There we were in the 1990s.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.980
Some of it even started
a little earlier.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.990
And online brokerage started--

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.030
E*TRADE, Ameritrade.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.520
We'll dive into a number
of these companies

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.450
similar to PayPal
starting in 1998.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.730
So I thank you, Michael,
for pulling that together--

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.710
PayPal starting in 1998.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.720
That earlier wave, the
internet, access rather than

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.510
through bricks and mortar,
or physical checks,

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.440
or an old credit card
system vis-a-vis the payment

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.460
systems in PayPal, online
brokerage starts, emerges.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.530
Does it take off?

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.460
Not entirely.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.910
But over time, it's a big
story in the capital markets,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.740
especially retail investing.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.990
And then we get to
this other period,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.810
a new form of technology,
largely about mobile phones,

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.980
but not entirely about
mobile phones also related

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.750
to open API and
access to the data.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.350
Robinhood comes along.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.330
And also in the
payment area-- we've

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.850
talked about this already
a few classes ago-- a lot

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.740
of these payment startups.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.350
And Robinhood GEN really
further transforms an industry.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.320
And by 2019, Robinhood had
almost as many members online

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.870
through their mobile app
with just a handful of years

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.860
as E*TRADE or many of
the brokerage firms.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.500
So it's got that
parallels, and we're

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.190
going to dive into how
Robinhood pressed further.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.194
And I'm wondering, Michael, do
you have a Robinhood account?

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:20.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but I
haven't really used it

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.355
since I started paying loans.

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:23.460
GARY GENSLER: Oh, no.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.320
I understand why you
might not be investing

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.850
while you're in school
and why you might not

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.710
have the money to do
it, but you actually

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.260
have a Robinhood account.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.220
And while it's hard to
do it by a show of hands,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.920
but I imagine that many
other students in the class

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.160
have downloaded the app.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.710
So then a little
bit different area

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.740
that we're going to be chatting
about is robo advising.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.610
How has that transformed the
provision of retail investment

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.070
management, and how is
big finance reacting?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.040
And I'm wondering if, Romain,
if anybody wants to just take

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.440
a high level hit at that.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.190
ROMAIN: I hope so.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.830
We had great papers
on the topic.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.105
Any volunteers?

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:10.991
Weiyi?

00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:12.120
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.430
So I guess from the robot
advisor perspective is sort of,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.820
I personally feel, is a how
to transform people's behavior

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.060
from like now going to some
kind of financial advisors

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.640
to actually you're
now going through more

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.230
electronic platforms,
whereas traditionally,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.680
especially for maybe the younger
generations were a lot more

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.680
used to doing things online.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.510
I think robot advisors
provide them a new way

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.810
to construct their financial
portfolios rather than going

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.430
to a financial advisor.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:52.620
So it's definitely feeling like
it's going to take a bite out

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.298
of the existing financial
advisors, which are probably

00:07:56.298 --> 00:07:58.590
where we're talking about
from the retail asset manager

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.220
perspective.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.200
Some of them are trying
to, I feel like, emerge

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.770
or creating new platforms,
or either buying

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.180
some of the existing
platforms, or having some kind

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.390
of interaction with them.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.060
So the existing-- the asset
managers are definitely,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.430
I feel like, looking
more into how

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:26.418
to incorporate more tools
to come to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.418 --> 00:08:27.210
on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.043
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:33.270
So robo advising,
the ability to have

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.220
an application on your laptop
or on your phones, of course.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.500
Robo advising,
having an application

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.710
rather than having a
human but having analytics

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.700
embedded in a program give you
advice about asset allocation,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.780
investing, in the like.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.370
And then secondly, as
you said, big finance.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.300
And big finance in this case
is asset managers, generally,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.020
but also the brokerage
firms reacting.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.180
What do they do?

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.790
There's one other thing
that's similar to what

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.720
we see on online
brokerage and Robinhood.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.380
And that's about costs.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.790
It's not just about
a delivery system.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.500
It's not just about
mobile phones,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.050
but it's also about a cost
point and a price point.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.160
And we'll dive into
that a little bit,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.020
but robo advisors giving access
to financial advice at lower

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.360
costs, maybe in the range of
20 to 50 basis points a year.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.670
Asset management,
the whole field

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.970
of asset management, the
business of asset management

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.270
is accumulating assets
under management.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.880
And if you accumulate
$100 million

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.360
of assets under management
and charge 1% fee,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.580
that's $1 million of revenue.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:54.080
If you only charge a quarter of
a point, that's only $250,000

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.740
of revenues.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.860
Now, of course, you can multiply
because none of these firms

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.380
really want to just be
at $100 million of assets

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.580
under management.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.570
And the biggest, BlackRocks of
the world are at $5 trillion,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.840
$6 trillion, $7 trillion
of assets under management.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.650
But the robo advisors
have tucked in here

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.780
at a lower cost point.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.720
And that is also true on
the online brokerage side.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.760
So it's delivery mechanisms.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.350
It's user interfaces.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:31.350
It's service, and it's also a
cost and, thus, price points.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.000
In essence, can you do something
better, quicker, cheaper?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.010
That's a very simplistic
way to think about it.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.050
But any other FinTech trends?

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.062
There's a lot going on in
the capital markets that--

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.270
Romain, you want to see if
somebody wants-- they just

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.980
want to capture a couple of the
other trends beyond these two

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.706
on the retail side?

00:10:55.706 --> 00:10:57.100
ROMAIN: Any volunteers?

00:11:02.777 --> 00:11:03.360
Come on, guys.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.340
Nikhil, go ahead.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.840
Thank you.

00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:18.365
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:19.247
I was muted.

00:11:19.247 --> 00:11:21.330
I thought something
interesting was both Robinhood

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.640
and Wealthfront are moving
towards cash management.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.482
So they enter the market
from the stock side of things

00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:29.190
and robo advisor side
of things, but they

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.880
seem to converge to cash
management as a next product

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.740
to roll out.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.718
So that's a big trend.

00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:36.510
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.190
And look, even
Betterment, which we'll

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.600
talk about in the
robo advising space,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.207
Betterment is starting to enter
into the challenger bank area.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:47.290
They're not the only ones.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.140
You have TransferWise from
the payment side entering

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.970
into the challenger bank side.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.040
But absolutely, some
of these platforms

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.600
are then spreading out.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.230
So you could be robo
advisor first and then

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.080
move into something else.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.320
Other trends, because
of data, we'll

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.920
see there's a lot of
startups, dozens of startups

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.930
in the FinTech
space around data,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:16.060
around infrastructure, about
what many investors think

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.470
of as the back office side
of things that are connecting

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.950
exchanges with the public.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.700
There are many startups
around asset management

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.570
and trying to help
asset management out.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.650
And this would be big,
wholesale, institutional asset

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.600
management and not
just the retail side.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.680
So let's dive into a little bit
the history of online company

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.000
landscape and think
about this for a moment.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.130
Who really started
out this whole thing?

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.410
And I put some of
the foundation dates

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.290
and the number of customers.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.850
These are the
figures I could get.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.570
From time to time, I wasn't
able to online to find a figure.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.950
But Charles Schwab
and TD Ameritrade--

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.320
you might think of
them as Ameritrade--

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.130
both started back
in the early 1970s.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.320
Actually, free internet.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.530
The idea was a lower
cost brokerage.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.390
But what was happening
in the early 1970s,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.030
a really important part of
this saga is, out of the 1960s,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.150
there was a movement
that was ultimately

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.700
captured in congressional
action in the US.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.740
The US Congress got involved,
the Securities and Exchange

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.060
got involved to repeal
fixed commission rates.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.810
You see, for decades, the
New York Stock Exchange

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.620
had fixed commission rates set
by the members of the New York

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.750
Stock Exchange.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:55.420
And the institutional
world, the larger investors,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.080
wanted discounts,
wanted cheaper rates.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.560
And in the early 1970s,
there was this movement

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.110
to free that up, not to have
fixed set rates by the New York

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.610
Stock Exchange.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.050
And around this time,
Schwab, Ameritrade

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.760
started, later affiliated
with Toronto Dominion Bank

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.070
and thus the TD.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.290
Each 50-some years later,
about 12 million users.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.160
E*TRADE starts in the
'80s, Firstrade later.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.750
Interactive Brokers,
a remarkable company,

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.770
more on the institutional side,
little less than a million

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.150
and so forth.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.200
Monex bought
TradeStation, but Monex

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.130
from the '90s and even
TradeStation earlier.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.950
Each of these companies were
chipping away a little bit

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.400
of the old concept of brokers.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.120
And there were many challenges
in the 1990s into the noughts

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.100
between Schwab and Ameritrade,
and E*TRADE and traditional

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.980
firms like Merrill
Lynch and the like.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.250
The asset managers themselves,
the big asset managers

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.090
like Fidelity and Vanguard
pre-date all of this.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.520
But Fidelity and
Vanguard also were

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.840
saying, how can we, in
addition to wealth management,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.540
offer online brokerage?

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.330
And as we all know,
if you have an account

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.250
with Fidelity or
Vanguard, or for that

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.490
matter with T. Rowe Price or
other large asset managers

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:37.160
in the US, at some point in
time in the last 20-ish years,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.670
some starting in the mid
'90s, some waiting all the way

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.980
until the late
noughts, they started

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.150
to say they're going to
compete with traditional Wall

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.330
Street, the Merrill
Lynches and so forth.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.830
And they were going to compete
by offering an online ability

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.990
to buy and sell stocks.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.070
Both got into the business.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:03.420
It's not that the big banks
didn't notice and everything.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.360
And some of them, even
in the last few years,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.040
started discount
retail packages.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.470
Merrill Lynch, which
I keep mentioning,

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.760
Merrill Lynch Edge
2010 was a product

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.450
after Merrill Lynch was
bought by Bank of America.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.940
And Bank of America is
thinking, OK, it's post-crisis.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.890
They buy Merrill Lynch.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.190
Merrill Lynch has this
remarkable multiple

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:33.410
1,000-person
organization of brokers,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.560
but they do Edge to be online.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.540
And even Ally
Bank, Ally Finance,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.300
which started in the
auto lending business,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:50.630
was that first challenger bank
in 2009, by 2016 is saying,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.040
we can get into
this, too, online--

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.460
4 million members.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.210
But where are we
on the startups?

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.120
The startups, Robinhood in
2013 and all this package

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.079
of startups in
the last few years

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.369
really have transformed things.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:15.000
So what I was saying is
these FinTech startups,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.520
primarily we think of
Robinhood, but there's a bunch

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.609
of others within other markets.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.569
Like Freetrade, and
Tastyworks, and Webull

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:28.800
have come along partly
because of mobile phones,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.090
partly because even the Schwabs
and Ameritrades were still

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.690
charging, whether it was
a few pennies a share,

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.660
but still charging $0.03
$0.04, $0.05 cents a share

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.340
and so forth.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:49.040
User interface and cost provided
some opportunity to move in.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.610
So I'm going to just talk a
little bit about the large

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.080
companies, that E*TRADEs,
and Ameritrades,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.910
and Fidelities and the like for
a moment because part of it is

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.840
about mobile trading.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.310
And they each-- and
this chart that I

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.380
was able to get from
StockBrokers.com,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.190
a comparison was just
like, what are the apps?

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.320
What is that user interface?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.860
And this was one example.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.600
But better believe that whether
you're Merrill Lynch Edge

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.870
or you're Robinhood,
you're also thinking about,

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.420
do I interface well with
an iPhone, an Android,

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.220
and so forth, and Apple Watch?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.900
I have to have that
connectivity and that technology

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.130
to be ready and used
on all of these.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.580
And you can run
your eye through,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.570
can I have trading on each of
these products, mutual funds?

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.320
And particularly
electronic trading

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.000
often is around ETFs
but not only ETFs.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.550
And as the cryptocurrency space
came up, a number of them said,

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.060
well, can we trade
cryptocurrencies as well?

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.070
Not the E*TRADES
and Ameritrades,

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:59.050
but the Robinhoods and the
disruptors were into that

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.110
space.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.350
So it's just a little
bit of a comparison

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.990
in how some folks think.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.480
Recent developments
are really important.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.410
And the biggest one
was late in 2019,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.170
what's called the Broker Wars.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.270
What happened start was--

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.850
at the start was Robinhood was
eating into this, 6 million,

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.370
7 million, 8 million members,
now maybe 10 million members.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.950
And as we saw the
earlier numbers,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.480
Schwab and Ameritrade are
only at about 12 million.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.110
And as that was
happening, IBKR, which

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:41.010
is that smaller but remarkable
company, Institutional Brokers,

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.530
in September of
2019 said they were

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.630
going to go to free brokerage
for some of their accounts.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.270
It wasn't 100%, but
they were going to go.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.710
And within weeks,
early in October 2019,

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.510
Schwab finally said,
zero commission.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.850
Now, what's
fascinating, I think,

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.090
is this is the
challenge that we're in.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.580
We're in the challenge
of, are there

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:14.930
financial services that will
move to zero top line pricing?

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.370
And what we've
found, whether it's

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:22.400
in Facebook or in many, many
online applications and outside

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.900
of the financial world,
it's a zero fee environment.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.580
And then the business model is
earning money some other way.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.100
In Facebook's case, it's about
marketing and advertising.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.380
90-plus% of their
revenue is really

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.360
about advertising
and marketing if you

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.720
look at that business model,
that remarkable business model.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.590
But it may be on the data.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.440
It may be cross-selling
and marketing.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.160
It may be on the data.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.330
It may be somewhere else.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.810
We're going to talk about the
revenue model of Robinhood

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.040
in a moment.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.700
But Charles Schwab reacted.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.560
E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade all
within one week went to zero

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.340
commission.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.980
And in fact, it
led to Schwab being

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.340
able to do the next
thing, which was announce

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.960
the purchase of Ameritrade.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.530
With collapsing
revenues in Ameritrade,

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.930
Schwab could
actually say, we're--

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.540
they made him an offer,
purchase for $26 billion.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.690
Morgan Stanley wasn't
going to be outdone.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.580
And early in 2020,
Morgan Stanley,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.970
one of the most venerable
old-line investment banks

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.150
dating all the way
back to James--

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:36.680
to J.P. Morgan himself, the
industrialist that though

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.540
he's departed this world
many decades ago has his name

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:46.610
on Morgan Stanley
and JP Morgan Chase,

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.690
Morgan Stanley buys
E*TRADE earlier this year.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.140
If you would have told the
Morgan Stanley executives when

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.070
E*TRADE started 30 years ago
that some time they would

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.590
in their future buy E*TRADE,
they would have scratched

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.020
their head and said, really?

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.240
We're going to be a retail
online brokerage firm?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.130
So it's an interesting
change in this world.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.960
So what's the long road?

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.290
What's the long
road of commissions?

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.500
This is the-- a
much earlier chart,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.940
but if you look
at this gray line,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.600
this commission rates
from $0.25 a share

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.270
down to about $0.03 cents
a share in 2008 or 2009.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.740
I think this chart
cuts off around 2008.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.890
This long march of
competition in part

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.620
is because of volumes
as you can see on this,

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.200
that volumes were going up and
commissions were going down.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.590
So some of it is
just efficiency,

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.190
but it's also this competition
that was coming in from E*TRADE

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:56.620
and Ameritrade on
the retail side.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.820
But Robinhood
entered a world that

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.480
still had $0.03, $0.04,
$0.05 cents commission.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.480
Robinhood initially
did an online app

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:14.730
that was easy with a mobile
phone to start an account.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.790
But what they also did is they
said, we'll do it for free.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:22.058
Their business model from
2013 on, we'll do it for free.

00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:23.100
And how did they do that?

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.050
What's the revenue
model behind that?

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.830
Anybody want to take a
moment of pause, Romain?

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.210
I will answer this question.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.330
I'm just saying, Romain,
who amongst the class

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.790
would think, how
could you be so bold?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.640
As a startup venture
capitalist, you

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.230
start an entrepreneurial
effort free online brokerage

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.860
from day one.

00:23:47.724 --> 00:23:49.980
ROMAIN: Any volunteers?

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.480
Victor.

00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:59.060
AUDIENCE: I guess you can either
make a profit on lending money

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.370
to traders so they
can purchase stock.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.880
And you can also use some
high-frequency trading,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.145
as some people said, that's
probably what it's doing

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:10.620
in order to before you sell,
you actually go through a--

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.415
determine the area to
make a profit out of.

00:24:13.415 --> 00:24:14.530
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.360
So Victor's raised two things.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.370
I'm going to focus
on the second,

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:23.170
was the relationship of
these mobile platforms,

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.870
Robinhood in particularly,
and high-frequency trading.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:33.360
What Robinhood knew was that a
feature of the capital markets

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.560
was that there were firms
that would pay for order flow.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.820
They would pay a very modest
amount, maybe a penny a share,

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.520
but they would pay just
to receive the order flow.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.600
And this is a feature of
the competitive markets,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.800
the competitive
exchange markets.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.400
In the US, we have 50 to
70 individual exchanges.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.080
We think of the New
York Stock Exchange.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.000
We think about
NASDAQ and so forth,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.600
but there are many
other electronic markets

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.670
where transactions occur.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.380
And some people call
them the dark markets.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.340
But all of those markets
might pay for order flow.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.980
And then individual
trading shops,

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.890
high-frequency trading shops,
might pay for order flow.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.700
What that means is they
want to have a first look.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.640
They want to have those
orders and to route them

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.290
through their algorithms and
into their either exchange

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.620
engines, if it's an exchange
that's paying for order flow,

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.580
or a high-frequency trading shop
that's paying for order flow.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.670
And the exchanges have
different fee structures

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.720
depending upon whether
you make a bid or offer

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.400
or you take a bid or offer.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.810
You will sometimes hear this
called maker and taker rates.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:02.120
Making a bid or offer, putting
a resting bid or a resting offer

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.730
into an exchange engine is
more valuable for the exchange

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.870
because it brings other
orders into the exchange.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.870
So what Robinhood
figured out was

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.430
they could offer the retail
public something for free

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.300
because they entered into
two or three major contracts

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.640
with hedge funds, with
high-frequency trading

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.820
shops saying, we will
enter into something

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.170
where we're selling you the
order flow for a modest amount.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.910
I don't know the exact
amount, but let's

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.340
call it a penny a share inside
the pricing of the $0.03

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.210
or so to $0.05 that the
online brokers were charging,

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.930
but still very valuable
over time for Robinhood.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.470
And then bingo, 6 or 8
million members later,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.930
account holders later
and a good user face,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.110
we get into the Broker Wars
where others drop their rates

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.260
as well.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.370
And so then I go to this
interesting zero commission

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.630
model chart that
talks about, well,

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.240
how could you have the cost
of financial advice be zero?

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.370
Well, it's because
of everything else.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:20.620
And the everything else model,
whether it's for Morgan Stanley

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:26.470
and E*TRADE, whether it's
for Schwab, Charles Schwab,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.670
or whether it's for
Robinhood, as Victor said,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:35.430
this is everything else that
might be valuable for you.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.920
Picking up payment
for order flow

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.130
is the third one on this
list, but margin interest,

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.350
maintenance fees,
transaction fees,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.640
saying once you have a client,
there's a lot of other revenues

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.770
that can be garnered.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.980
So once Facebook has
your information,

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.100
there are other revenues
that Facebook can garner.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.260
But in the brokerage space,
this is very well known.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.970
This was known in the 1960s and
1970s when the large investment

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.700
banks would think, if
I have a relationship

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:14.720
with this big insurance company,
I can earn money in other ways.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.380
It's what led in part
in the early 1970s

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.800
to break the old
decades-old fixed commission

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.200
rates because large
investment banks wanted

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.760
to discount and lower their
rates for large institutions,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.060
not for the retail public
but for large institutions.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.540
That was 50 years
ago, but that was also

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.320
because there's all
this revenue potential,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:45.080
as this little graphic
says, beneath the surface.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.990
Romain, questions if I can
pause a little bit, because it's

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.990
about the business
models of brokerage

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.906
and the business models
of investment banking.

00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:56.390
ROMAIN: Let's wait a few
seconds so people have the time.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.250
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE] lived
at Goldman Sachs for 18 years,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.312
even though that feels
like another era.

00:29:02.312 --> 00:29:03.820
ROMAIN: So we have
a few questions.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.775
Let's take Luke and then Hassan.

00:29:05.775 --> 00:29:08.520
AUDIENCE: So I have
one quick question

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.970
when it comes to traders
or trading platforms.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:17.040
Banks usually make money by
holding deposits in daily basis

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.920
because that's a
revenue to the firm.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.960
It's especially
hard to do so in US

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.460
when interest rate is near zero.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.810
But in emerging markets, such
as Korea, China, or India,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.810
they basically make the revenue
if you have somebody's money.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.500
And you can lend it out in a
net interest margin of positive.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.730
How do platforms like
these, E*TRADE or Robinhood,

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.510
make money when they transfer
the money from deposit

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.940
to their account and
takes two, three days,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.630
and they can make money out
of it besides these hedge fund

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.180
deals that you have explained?

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.980
GARY GENSLER: So
a great question.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.700
So the classic what I would
call commercial bank model

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.650
is exactly what Luke said.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:04.190
To pot-- there's a net interest
spread between the depositors'

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.700
money and what you lended out.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.360
And whether you're a $1 trillion
bank or a $100 million bank,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.123
it's basically that spread
between the depositors' money

00:30:14.123 --> 00:30:15.290
and what you're lending out.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.870
That model has been
around for centuries.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.690
And as Luke said,
it's a little bit more

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.300
challenging in different
interest rate environments,

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.680
but that's been there.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.110
The brokerage
business traditionally

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.410
was making money on
commissions, and commissions

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.230
was a big part of that
revenue model all the way

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.350
through the 1960s and '70s.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.780
But there's other
pieces of it as well

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.600
beyond just the
commission of, as we

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.750
saw on that chart, $0.25
a share long ago or $0.03

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.480
or $0.05 a share more recently.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.210
Beyond that, it's also, when
you buy and sell securities,

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.920
you-- there is what's known
as a bid-offer spread,

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.340
the difference
between the bid side

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.240
and where somebody is offering.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.450
And a market maker
can be in the middle

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.400
and provide liquidity
to the market,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.740
get paid for taking risks.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.800
It's a risk-return business.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.200
But first, Luke, is
the bid-offer spread,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.170
just being in the flow.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.480
In Robinhood's case,
Robinhood said,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.580
we don't have a balance sheet.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.790
We're not going to pay
for the bid-ask spread.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.010
But we will enter
into transactions

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.020
with high-frequency
trading shops

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:34.170
and effectively give them access
to this flow of transactions.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.930
And so that's payment
for order flow.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.760
And the high-frequency
trading shops

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.080
are, in essence, trying to tap
into that bid-offer spread.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.660
So that's a dominant part of it.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.090
In addition, just to
name one other, but there

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.410
are many others--

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.320
in addition, Charles
Schwab and others--

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.170
Merrill Lynch figured
this out decades ago.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.930
Once you have that
customer relationship,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.480
that customer relationship will
come to you for other things,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.440
and they will come to you
to do margin lending, which

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.780
is a form of borrowing.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.470
And so you have maybe
then that customer there

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.080
who you can actually
use your balance sheet

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.560
and lend them money, usually
what's called margin lending.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.960
So I'm just mentioning
two of them.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.830
Bid-ask spread, Robinhood was
not taking that themselves.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.930
They were selling that access.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.060
And then the
relationship that you

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:32.083
can have when using your
balance sheet and lending money.

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:34.500
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us a
little bit about the kickbacks

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.747
in the presentation?

00:32:35.747 --> 00:32:36.830
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.413
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:32:38.413 --> 00:32:40.220
about the kickbacks in
the presentation you

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.460
have here in the small letters?

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.252
GARY GENSLER: Well,
these are not my words.

00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:46.880
These are Jason
Wenk of Altruist.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.720
But in essence, there's
so many different ways

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.950
that you might take a
customer's order flow

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:03.630
and sell access to that, or you
might be the front end model.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.360
You could be-- I'm not saying
Robinhood or Schwab are

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.660
doing this, but you can
be that front end model.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.560
And then somebody else will
pay you, pay the Schwab,

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.660
pay the Robinhood.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.090
And so I think what Jason
Wenk, who wrote this,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.530
is calling that a kickback.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:24.300
But it's a contractual
arrangement

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.810
to be-- have access to that
customer and that order flow.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.430
AUDIENCE: Can I safely assume
that they're selling our data

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.305
as well as Google is doing?

00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:35.720
GARY GENSLER: So data
is really important,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.220
and data is really important
for multiple reasons.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.150
One, the better data you
have, the better trading

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.070
algorithms you can create.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.470
So part of the
payment for order flow

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.120
is to capture bid-ask spread.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.700
Part of the payment
for order flow

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.180
is the data so that you
can build your algorithms.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.030
You have more data for your
machine learning, absolutely.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.150
There's also other
relevant data,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.770
but fundamentally the data
is to be a better market

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.257
maker and a better investor.

00:34:07.257 --> 00:34:09.340
I think Romain, there was
somebody else that still

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.630
had a question before I go on.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.625
ROMAIN: Yes, Hassan.

00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:13.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, Professor.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:14.230
Yeah.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.630
My question is about
the bid-ask margin.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.690
And I'm just wondering,
I mean, so for instance

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:27.260
like Robinhood, they--

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.880
so because they
had many customers,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.560
they could get better
deals, and they

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.060
could benefit from the flow
of customers that they have.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.620
Is this how they make money?

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.535
I'm just wondering.

00:34:40.535 --> 00:34:43.639
GARY GENSLER: Well, so actually,
the way they made money is they

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:47.480
were getting paid for that flow
because their business model

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.330
early on, and others
like them now,

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:56.510
said we will go to the investing
public and zero commission.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:01.300
And somebody else will pay us.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.490
A fraction of a penny
at this point in time

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.970
would be enough, but
a fraction of a penny.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.820
That other party
would pay us to,

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.200
in essence, route those
transactions to the stock

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.860
exchanges.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.480
And so one company that
does pay for order flow

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.630
is a large hedge fund
high-frequency shop

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.050
from Chicago called
Citadel, which

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.670
I don't know its
current size, but it

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:31.060
used to be about a $20 billion
hedge fund asset management

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:36.880
shop and very active in
high-frequency trading.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.000
It's very public that it is.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.930
And so Citadel is one of those
vendors on the other side

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:47.200
of the Robinhood app.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.040
And then they find a way, as
we were talking with Luke.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.320
They find the Citadels of
the world, not just Citadel.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.570
They find that order flow
is then valuable for them.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.050
They're routing some of
it to the Stock Exchange,

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.240
and that could still
be worth something.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.130
They're putting it
into their analytics.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.740
They then get better
sophisticated machine

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.250
learning on the analytics.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.600
And that order flow
is also something

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.250
that can be very valuable to an
operator of a dark market, one

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.850
of these small
electronic markets,

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.200
because you're all competing.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.590
If there's 60 or 70 of
these small dark markets,

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.220
they're all competing for
volume and market share.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.260
And then all of the
sudden, Robinhood has not

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.220
just a few 100,000 customers,
but they have 5 million or 10

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.120
million customers.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.290
Then they can provide
a lot of order flow

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:47.850
and a lot of market coverage
for somebody on the other side.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.770
Now, as it relates to Schwab,
Schwab and some of the earlier

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.070
online brokers, they got into
the business of collecting

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.750
assets under management.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:01.370
They got into the asset under
management custodial side

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.660
of the business as well.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.830
There's a lot of other revenue
streams, transaction fees,

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:12.360
account maintenance fees,
and even advisory fees

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.070
in those shops.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.200
I want to move on now
to wealth management.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.950
I think you'll see
merging between the wealth

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:26.820
management fees and
the brokerage fees,

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.300
which is exactly what
we've seen over time

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.860
in the traditional
brokerage field.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.560
In the traditional
brokerage field for decades,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.990
a broker earned commissions.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:40.070
And then they started
by the late 1990s,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.650
with some support
from the regulators,

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.550
to change their revenue models.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.520
The traditional
Merrill Lynch broker

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.680
from the 1930s to the 1980s
was a commission-based broker.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.330
But by the 1990s, they started
to charge advisory fees,

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.870
meaning for instance,
maybe 1% of the assets

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.650
that you left with them.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.280
And if you leave $1 million,
if you're wealthy enough

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.780
to have that $1
million, that means

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:10.310
that they're earning $10,000
a year on your account.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.110
If you obviously had
more, that would even

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.270
be better for Merrill
Lynch and worse for you

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.390
because you'd be leaving
them a lot of money to just

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:25.220
be a custodian for
your account largely

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.040
and to give you advice
from time to time.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.060
And that's the set up
for the next discussion.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.550
Romain, any questions?

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.270
ROMAIN: No.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.522
All good.

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:39.240
GARY GENSLER: So robo
advisory-- and Hassan sort of

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.718
helped me set this up.

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.510
I'm going to do the
same sort of landscape.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.560
We have the same groups,
retail brokers, asset managers,

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.030
and the banks.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:51.750
Advisory work, brokerage
advisory was largely,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:55.050
for many decades, the
domain of investment banks

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.740
and broker dealers, Merrill
Lynch, Smith Barney,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:04.020
Paine Webber, many, many
companies across the land,

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.550
small and large.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.980
And they were a
commission-based business.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.470
By the 1990s, as
I mentioned, they

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:17.690
started to move to a financial
advisory commission number.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.880
And I can't remember exactly
what year it was in the 1990s.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.160
Even the Securities
and Exchange Commission

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.950
changed some rules to
facilitate some of that.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.890
Coming from the other side,
the big asset managers

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:36.210
managing pension money and
managing big pools of money

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.250
through mutual
funds also started

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.580
to get into the
retail advisory space.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.590
And thirdly, you
had the brokers,

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.850
the Schwabs and so forth.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.930
Now, I've put some names here
like Charles Schwab Intelligent

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:54.810
Portfolios, which is a more
recent rollout, that branding,

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.780
Intelligent Portfolios
or TD America's

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.480
Ameritrade's
Essential Portfolios,

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.150
more recent roll out for them.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.780
And they've been
reacting to this crowd,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:12.930
this remarkable,
entrepreneurial, mobile app

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.030
robo advisors.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.540
And these companies span the
globe in Europe, US, and Asia.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.590
But what Betterment, or
Nutmeg, and others are doing

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:32.760
is they're saying, we can
give more financial inclusion,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.170
and we can do it in a better
user interface and a lower cost

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.730
structure.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:42.090
By and large, the
asset management fees

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:45.870
for an account in the
traditional brokerage

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.990
environment was
hovering close to 1%.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.940
There was some
price compression.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.890
Some of it was coming down
into the 3/4 of 1% to 1% area.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:41:00.300
That means, again, if you were
fortunate enough to have--

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.650
let's just say that
you had $500,000,

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.830
and you were able to have
somebody invest it for you

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.560
or advise you.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.300
1% of $500,000 is $5,000.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.410
That's $400 a month that
you were paying, in essence,

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:19.500
for somebody to give
you occasional advice

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.210
and be your custodian for
your electronic securities,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.540
because everything was
digital by this point in time.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.380
It was no longer those
earlier days where

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.590
you had physical certificates.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.150
This group came
along and said, maybe

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.760
we could do it at a different
price point, a better user

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.350
interface, maybe better
analytics and service,

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:43.280
generally somewhere between 30
to 50 basis points or a quarter

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.135
to a half a percent.

00:41:44.135 --> 00:41:49.730
That same $500,000, if you
were to have that $500,000,

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.630
all of the sudden doesn't cost
you $5,000 or $4,000 a year,

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.860
but it's costing maybe $1,500
a year or $100 a month.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.350
Now, you don't get a bill
for the $100 a month.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:07.070
It just comes out each
month out of your account,

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:11.000
and it's charged
as a fee per se.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.420
But there's generally a
different price point.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.020
We haven't gone all the way that
we went with online brokerage,

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.520
to mobile brokerage, to
zero accounts, zero fees.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.250
But one of the great pressures
that have happened here

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:31.410
as well, which is off this
page, is asset management fees

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.200
have been coming down
as well and particularly

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.870
around a product called
exchange traded funds.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.630
And to understand the
field of robo advisors,

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.000
I just want to mention
something about exchange traded

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.140
funds, which is an
invention of the late 1990s.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:50.010
That was a FinTech of its
time that somebody came up

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.610
with the idea, I can
have a mutual fund.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:58.600
I can have a mutual fund that
invests in the entire market,

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.390
and I can do it at a low cost.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.340
And I can package it
through a security.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.400
So let me unpack that.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.680
The first innovation was an
innovation of the early 1970s.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.730
Jack Bogle, who was the key
innovator behind Vanguard,

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:19.630
said, wouldn't it be great if
we gave America at the time

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.660
a product they can invest
in the whole stock market

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.910
a little bit of each company?

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.990
And we're not going
to manage it for them.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.850
We're just going to
algorithmically, arithmetically

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.310
pick a little bit
of every stock.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.230
And it was called an index fund.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.300
We take it for
granted, but that was

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.860
an innovation, a remarkable
innovation of the 1970s.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.640
Everybody could have a piece of
the stock market at a low cost.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.540
And to this day, Vanguard is
still not a publicly traded

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.800
for-profit company.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.060
It's a mutual company.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.740
Vanguard is held and
owned by its mutual funds

00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:00.980
that are held and owned by us
if we're a part of Vanguard.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.080
That innovation then
led to an innovation

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.180
in the 1990s that
said, what can we

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.790
do to make this
even more efficient?

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:11.700
What if we take an
index mutual fund

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.860
and take the interest
in the mutual funds

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.810
and make those securities?

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.510
Took a little change
in some regulations,

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.030
but all of the sudden, we had
this thing called exchange

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.410
traded funds, these
low-cost ways to participate

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.930
in the stock market,
the bond market,

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.720
some in the gold
and silver markets--

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.630
exchange traded funds.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:39.300
All of these robo advisors
in their packaging have said,

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.420
we can get you into
this and get you out

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.050
of this, into this market
or out of this market,

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.030
and use exchange traded funds.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:52.810
The second big innovation
for robo advisors, of course,

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:56.400
is everything we talked about
out of artificial intelligence

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.970
and natural language
programming, processing,

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:06.550
the ability to take voice or
take digital and transfer that

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:12.680
into machine language, computer
language, and the reverse.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.300
So robo advisors came
along at a point in time

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.990
where you could basically
automate us humans a bit,

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:25.100
not entirely, but
we could step back.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:29.210
Humans step back, and
robo advice goes in.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.370
And you could do it
a lower price point.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.280
And the third
innovation was basically

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.580
some simple analytics--

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.170
not machine learning, but
simple analytics on portfolio

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.270
and asset allocation.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.730
Some of it's related to,
if you're in your 20s

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.450
and you're saving
for retirement,

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:49.520
you could take more risk.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.940
You could have a higher equity
share versus a bond share.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.820
If you're in your 60s, and
you're about to retire,

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.030
you should be more stable,
a little less risk, maybe

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:01.280
more bonds and less equities.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.650
Some of it's that
simple, but they were

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.640
able to basically take that.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.650
And so the Betterment
started, and they

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:15.660
could find really readily
available software

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.580
for asset allocation.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.390
They could use products
like exchange traded funds.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.460
Mobile phones were
around already.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.630
So they had a good platform.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:31.090
And they say, all right,
we'll go to a lower fee point.

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:34.180
And all of the sudden, we start
to see a real change of things.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.461
Questions, Romain?

00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:38.980
ROMAIN: While we wait for
questions on this topic,

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.560
we have a question in the chat
about Robinhood's business

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.380
model from George.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.300
Do you see Robinhood
and other startups

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.400
starting their own
high-frequency trading

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.980
operations instead of
selling the order flows?

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.280
And then Devin asks
whether maybe Citadel

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.830
or any other hedge fund should
just buy Robinhood outright.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.810
GARY GENSLER: These are
two really great questions

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:02.620
about the future.

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:11.500
I think that in both ways
will the front end platform--

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.240
and that's really, in a sense,
Robinhood and, even in this

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.470
robo advisor space, the
Betterments of the world--

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.830
is a front end user
interface platform

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:25.230
that tend not to
have balance sheets.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.800
And they tend to let somebody
else handle that capital

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.490
markets risk behind it.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:36.570
But the question here is,
do I see the front end

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:39.610
building balance sheet and
moving into the capital market

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:40.110
side?

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.800
And do I see the capital
market side, the balance sheet

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.890
risk taking, moving
into the front end side?

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.930
And we don't know,
but history tells

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.450
us that tends to
happen at some point,

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:55.500
that there's some
sort of what you might

00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.540
call vertical integration.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:06.060
And if you really think about
these slices on this page,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:10.890
the JP Morgan building you
invest in 2018 or Merrill Edge

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.150
in an earlier time--

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.590
and if I go back to
the brokerage side,

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.010
they're named
products there, too--

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:20.520
that's balance sheet
coupled with front end.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.370
That's the fully
integrated model.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.160
But then if you look at the
asset managers, the asset

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.230
managers, the
BlackRocks of the world

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:33.020
are not actually
acting as a principal.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.990
They're acting as an advisor,
a pure advisor, a pure agency

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.510
business.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:41.100
So one of the things is, do you
just want to stay as an agent,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.380
or do you actually
want to invest

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.150
your capital in the markets?

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.970
And that big business
decision separates

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:51.780
some of the asset managers
and then, as you mentioned,

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.580
the high-frequency traders.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.740
I think that if Robinhood
is going to be bought,

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.410
it could be bought by
high-frequency trading shop.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:04.180
But the challenge
there is, will they

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.640
still get as big
a customer base,

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.250
I mean 10 million customers?

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:14.440
Or is Robinhood more valuable
for one of the large banks

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.050
to buy or one of the
large asset managers?

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.060
I think if you look out
three to five years,

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:26.110
it's quite likely that Robinhood
gets merged up into something,

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.870
as you saw Morgan Stanley
buying E*TRADE as well.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:31.310
Another question?

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:31.970
ROMAIN: Yes.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:33.335
Let's go with Camillo.

00:49:33.335 --> 00:49:36.290
GARY GENSLER: And then I'm going
to do a few more slides here

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.862
on robo advisors.

00:49:38.862 --> 00:49:40.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, Gary.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:45.790
I wonder why platforms such
as Acorns and Betterment

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:50.610
that you were just talking about
have a mixed business model,

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:56.240
because in one way, they are
a robo advisor business model.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.733
But then they have savings
and checking accounts.

00:49:58.733 --> 00:49:59.650
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.720
AUDIENCE: They're stepping
a foot into a banking model.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.722
What's the reason to merge
the two spaces into one?

00:50:05.722 --> 00:50:07.930
GARY GENSLER: I think because
they have the front end

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.930
customer relationship,
and they have some trust.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.580
And this helps set something up.

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.340
This is a chart on users.

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.440
And it's got some
predictions here.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.000
We don't know if these
predictions will hold.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.840
But if you see the
use of robo advisors,

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.120
it's just getting
much more comfortable

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.280
that folks are being--
and this, I believe,

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.540
also includes the robo
advisors at the big shops

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.580
as well as the startups.

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.680
But just as if you have
that user interface--

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.950
and remember we talked
about challenger banks

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.500
as well, Camillo,
the challenger banks

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.410
last session, a lot of
it's about trust as well.

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:50.230
Once you have that
user interface,

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:54.350
there's a certain trust and,
frankly, stickiness to it.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.130
So if Betterment, which is
looking to become a challenger

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:01.890
bank, can use that
customer relationship,

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.810
then you can build the platform.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:07.320
And back to the
economics of platforms,

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.740
the economics of platforms
is as you layer activities

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:15.920
on top of a platform, and if
you can grow your user base,

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.340
you get more data, you
get more centrality.

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:23.430
There's not going to
be 10 years from now

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.170
this many advisory platforms.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.960
And in fact, in the blue,
the advisory platforms,

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.150
I picked the ones
that are large.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.780
There's 50 to 100 others
that I haven't listed.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.730
So there is going
to be consolidation.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.700
As sure as we're
here at this moment,

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.400
there's going to be
consolidation in this space.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.890
And so they're trying to build
classic platform economics,

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:48.630
build activities,
build user bases.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.880
And this is assets
under management,

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.950
the same website behind this.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.260
But as of a few days ago, just
a sense of, what are the assets?

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.820
This is in billions.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:13.890
So in 2020, $1.2 trillion
of assets under management

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.110
somehow associated
with robo advisors.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:19.650
So even a 1/4%
fee on this starts

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.620
to be a real revenue model.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.300
Possible evolution, I
like thinking about,

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.990
where could this
go in the future?

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:30.630
Where did robo advising start,
all the way on the left?

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:32.490
It's just an online
questionnaire

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:36.840
about asset allocation largely,
and an online questionnaire,

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:42.540
a mobile questionnaire about
products and risk and how--

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.820
and then usually
a list of exchange

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.010
traded funds, some bonds.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:53.920
So simple but very accessible,
broadening financial inclusion

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.210
for lower rates.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.670
And it helps a lot of
people, a lot of investors

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.440
sleep well at night.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.230
It lowers their uncertainty.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:05.620
I'm getting some good advice
about asset allocation,

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.350
some risks, some life events.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.797
But could move it move further?

00:53:09.797 --> 00:53:10.630
That's the question.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.130
Can it move further?

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.910
And exactly like Camillo said
and Luke's earlier question

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:20.110
about other revenues, can robo
advisors-- like Betterment

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.860
say, well, we'll actually
be the fund manager.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.080
We'll start to actually
manage the funds

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.590
rather than just doing
these low-cost ETFs.

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.630
And maybe we'll
start to actually do

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.960
something more
with regard to risk

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.850
based portfolio allocation.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.710
Maybe we'll start in
this third column,

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.690
do a little bit of algorithms.

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:43.440
Maybe, in fact, we'll
start to do trading and be

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.150
principals rather than just
an agent and an advisor

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.050
and the like.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:54.570
So there's going to be more
sophisticated algorithmic AI

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:55.560
or machine learning.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.350
But I don't think it's going to
be highly sophisticated machine

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:03.000
learning because there's
a certain commoditization

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.980
about the advice.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:09.720
But it is quite possible
as we move forward

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.450
that somebody will figure
out what risk I should

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.030
take versus somebody else.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:17.300
Andrew Lo, a faculty
member at MIT,

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.520
thinks that you can
take machine learning

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.180
and embed it in even an
index fund, that you could

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.350
have inside of an index fund--

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.100
what Andy talks about is
called "the freakout factor,"

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.500
that we all have
different risk profiles.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.890
When the stock market
goes out, down,

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:42.240
how likely are we to, quote, as
he says, "freak out" and want

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.530
to sell?

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:48.120
And that we could, based upon
other aspects of our lives,

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.280
put that into a
machine learning model

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:56.300
and have it automatically
adjust up and down.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.210
Questions before I think
I'm going to go to the--

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:02.620
broadly the capital
markets piece?

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:08.710
ROMAIN: We have a question.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.460
GARY GENSLER: So we've
sort of covered--

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.590
I'm pausing here for a
second, but we've sort of

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:16.190
covered the online
brokerage, robo advisor,

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:20.480
those two big pieces as captured
by Robinhood and Betterment,

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:25.790
might be the two companies
that are the leads of the pack,

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:26.990
but they're not alone.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:30.000
And in the wealth
management side,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.460
it's much more evenly split,
whereas in the mobile side,

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.910
in the mobile brokerage
side, Robinhood

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:44.667
seemed to really sort of
punched high and done well.

00:55:44.667 --> 00:55:46.250
ROMAIN: The only
question we have here

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.900
is from the chat from Luke.

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.150
What kind of US
regulation is [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:52.820
the likes of Robinhood
to expand globally

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:57.665
or to attract
capital from abroad?

00:55:57.665 --> 00:56:01.320
GARY GENSLER: Well, this
is a highly regulated

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.520
space in both the advisory
side and the brokerage side.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.970
And Robinhood would certainly
need to be aware of that

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:15.120
and register appropriately as
a broker dealer here in the US.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.870
And then on the asset
management side,

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:21.480
there's a little bit different
regulation but also regulated

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.350
here.

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:26.190
Attracting capital
from overseas,

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:28.680
if the capital is just
investing in Robinhood,

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:35.130
in one of their venture
rounds, BCD rounds,

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.430
because these are probably
private placements largely

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.800
speaking, other than
the usual regulations

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.040
around sanctions and
anti-money laundering,

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.520
it'd be straightforward.

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.630
If it's actually customers
using the platform,

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.670
then a Robinhood would have
to be aware of the regulations

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.880
in that jurisdiction, whether
it's the regulations in Europe

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.570
or in your home country,
Luke,-- in Korea, that they'd--

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:05.190
those customer-facing
applications, Robinhood Korea

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:08.340
would have to think, do they
register as a broker dealer

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.880
in Korea or Japan and the
like, as they are, in fact,

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:18.690
just a mobile application
for a traditional investment

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:19.440
brokerage firm?

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:26.570
So again trying to
capture capital markets.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:31.060
Capital markets is a
vast array of activities

00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:37.160
from accessing capital to
trading platforms and the like.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.700
And this slide
from McKinsey just

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.045
captures an earlier
stage of, where

00:57:42.045 --> 00:57:44.340
is FinTech in each of these?

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.690
And I'm not going to go
through each of these buckets,

00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:52.780
but part of why I have this is
it's so many little buckets.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.580
We talked about two
on the retail side.

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.510
There are crowdfunding
platforms, literally platforms

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:01.210
that help companies raise money.

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:04.480
There's trade execution, and
I'm going to talk about a couple

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.600
in a minute,
decentralized trading

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.860
platforms like cryptocurrencies,
but also centralized trading

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.420
platforms and cryptocurrencies.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:16.180
But even in the last
few years, a firm

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:20.200
called IEX is a startup
in trade execution.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.020
It's a new trading platform.

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.580
There's post-trade services.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.630
There's a lot of
infrastructure and operations.

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.830
The capital markets are a vast
multi-trillion dollar business

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:36.470
globally in terms of revenues.

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:40.590
So I'm just going to
quickly touch upon some

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:43.180
in these next couple of slides.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.300
You can see, I picked
some dozen or so firms

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.880
that were just ones I kind
of like to watch and follow.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:54.040
We can take any questions
about each of these,

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.672
but there are a number of them
in the wealth management space.

00:58:57.672 --> 00:59:00.130
And one of the things in wealth
management we talked about,

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:04.060
like Betterment, is
facing the retail public.

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.420
But there are startups that are
in the wealth management space

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.220
facing financial advisors.

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:13.440
These tens of thousands
of financial advisors

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.750
want better software.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:18.720
And Addepar and a
number of others

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.560
are actually platforms for
the financial advisors,

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.100
that financial advisor that's
trying to build a business

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:31.250
wants software and access
to the capital market.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.280
So it's an interface
between the two.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.560
There's a bunch that are in the
area of collateral management

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.220
and infrastructure, CloudMargin.

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:49.790
Literally, collateral
management means the collateral

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:52.580
that you're moving
on derivatives

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.070
in the institutional
market or collateral

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:58.700
that you're moving even
as it relates to loans.

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.520
And why not start
a platform that

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.620
might be a little better
for collateral management

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:07.630
and take some of the back
office cost out of it?

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.260
And not to be outdone,
you could have

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.500
digital fixed-income brokers
as well as equity brokers.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.590
What we were talking about
earlier was the stock market

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:19.010
and this company
called Elephant.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.790
I mentioned IEX started in 2012.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.980
It's to be a competitive
stock market to NASDAQ,

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:30.860
New York Stock Exchange
started by a bunch of buy side

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.270
institutions, for instance.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.550
And sometimes,
it's just research.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:40.650
PitchBook and others
like PitchBook

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.380
put together a
remarkable data base

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.930
on the financial business of
venture capital, for instance.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:52.650
So it could be a lot
of different spaces.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:56.220
Back to thinking about the
different aspects of capital

01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.972
markets, crowdfunding
platforms, trade execution,

01:01:00.972 --> 01:01:04.220
the post-trade side of it.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.580
I don't do this to be like a
full course on capital markets,

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.740
but it's to open your
thinking to it's not just

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.360
the retail interface.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.700
It's not just using a mobile
phone, good data, good user

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.780
delivery, and lower cost.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.480
And that's really the
Robinhood, Betterment side.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.840
It's also a lot of taking
the paper flows out

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.340
of it, old processes
out of the back office,

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.390
and trying to provide a
service to the capital

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:38.860
markets in a better way.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.015
Romain, any--

01:01:45.985 --> 01:01:47.835
ROMAIN: Any hands raised?

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:49.335
Anyone has a question
on this topic?

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:52.810
No.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:53.795
I think we can move on.

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:56.170
GARY GENSLER: Let me just
close out crypto markets a bit.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.150
And some of you take the
crypto finance course,

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.970
so it may be a little
bit repetitive.

01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:03.640
But let me just say, one
thing that's interesting

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.570
is this crypto
market came along.

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.386
Is there a question here?

01:02:10.386 --> 01:02:12.300
ROMAIN: Luke has
his hand raised.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.140
GARY GENSLER: Let me hold Luke
because he's had a lot here.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.130
So let me just say
something on crypto markets,

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:20.340
and then we'll definitely
take Luke's question.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:26.020
But the crypto markets came
along about a dozen years ago.

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:29.850
And by an early stage of these
markets, somebody said, how

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.630
can you buy and sell Bitcoin?

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:36.470
And they created exchanges,
a new form of exchange,

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:39.140
not for equities,
not for bonds, not

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.930
for foreign currencies
or Fiat currencies,

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.490
but cryptocurrencies.

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:47.270
And these exchanges act
as agents matching buyers

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:51.100
and sellers like
traditional exchanges,

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.110
but they also act
as market makers.

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:56.590
We talked earlier about
capturing bid-ask spread.

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:59.620
These exchanges could also
buy and sell from customers.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.780
Not all of them
do, but they could.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.210
Traditional exchanges did not.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:07.480
And they also acted as a
custody and held your funds.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.320
And even to this day, if you
trade on a crypto exchange,

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.560
you're moving your
asset through the use

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.630
of what's called a private key.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:21.050
But you're moving your asset
to the crypto exchange,

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.430
and they're the custody.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.340
They're the custodian.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.290
The public has direct access.

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:29.900
And this is a very
different model

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.310
than traditional exchanges.

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.810
And the question
will be, will this

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:36.050
come to traditional markets?

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:38.950
And that's why I wanted
to focus on this minute.

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:42.760
In traditional markets built
upon a business model that's

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.000
multiple centuries
old, you and I

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
are not members directly of
the New York Stock Exchange.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.530
We have to go through somebody
to get to the New York Stock

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:52.030
Exchange.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.283
That's called a broker.

01:03:53.283 --> 01:03:55.450
It's called a member of the
New York Stock Exchange,

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:59.260
or the London Stock Exchange,
or the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.560
But in these markets,
in these crypto markets

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.980
everybody can access
directly the markets.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.380
The markets actually,
interestingly,

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:16.362
have to have a much more robust
API for the retail public.

01:04:16.362 --> 01:04:18.570
The New York Stock Exchange
and London Stock Exchange

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:23.310
have to have a robust API,
application program interface,

01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:24.540
for institutions.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.540
And it has to be very high
volume, very resilient.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.960
But it can be
limited to hundreds

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.870
or, at most, a couple
thousands of users

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:37.030
even if the volumes are high.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:40.180
These exchanges have to be
open to millions of people

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.540
from their home laptops
and mobile phones--

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:47.410
a very different architecture
where it's disintermediated

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:48.520
the broker dealers.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.810
And the question I have, which
is unanswerable right now,

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:55.180
will this be something
moving forward?

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.980
Will we see a
direct access model

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.090
at any exchange
around the globe,

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:03.400
or will we stay in the
intermediated access?

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.140
There's a lot of
regulatory reasons

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.710
we'd stay in the
intermediated access.

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:10.210
There's some competitive
reasons brokers wouldn't want

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.300
to have folks going directly.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.790
But on the other
hand, the technology

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:19.870
now exists that you
could go directly.

01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:24.550
And so these markets, by the
way, are not well regulated.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:28.628
And they're rife with fraud,
and scams, and manipulation.

01:05:28.628 --> 01:05:29.920
So I just want to mention that.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.470
I see a few hands in
addition to Luke's hand.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:33.865
So maybe we should pause.

01:05:33.865 --> 01:05:35.846
ROMAIN: Yes, Carlos?

01:05:35.846 --> 01:05:37.910
GARY GENSLER: And we
have to get Luke's, too.

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:39.425
But, Carlos, all right.

01:05:39.425 --> 01:05:41.430
AUDIENCE: So what do
you think would happen

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:45.210
if the big banks started holding
more crypto on their balance

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:45.870
sheets, right?

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:49.350
If they start acting as market
makers in crypto markets,

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:52.860
then would it-- for example,
under current regulation,

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.110
would this asset go
under Dodd-Frank as well

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:56.940
and therefore limit
proprietary trading,

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.360
or do you think it
would be different?

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.750
GARY GENSLER: So there's a
lot of questions in there.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.330
The large banks
around the globe today

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:09.620
have not been active
in this asset class.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.410
The asset class is
about $225 billion

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.960
as of this morning,
which is small.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.710
The worldwide capital markets
are between $300 trillion

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:24.410
and $400 trillion when you add
equities and bonds worldwide

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:26.100
and debt.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.830
So this is quite
small in comparison.

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:32.430
But for regulatory reasons and
for customer interest reasons,

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.190
the large banks
haven't really gone in.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.500
If they were to get in, to
answer answer your question

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.170
on the regulatory
side, yes, it would

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:42.830
be just like any other asset
they have, any commodity.

01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:44.930
So if you hold
Bitcoin, you might

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:50.240
think if you're JP Morgan,
I'm now holding it.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.530
I'm Barclays bank.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:52.670
I'm now holding it.

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:53.960
What regulations?

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.600
If it's Bitcoin, it would be
very similar to the regulations

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.880
around holding gold or silver.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.130
Maybe you would hold gold or
silver futures or contracts,

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:06.150
but holding gold, silver.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:09.350
And to the extent
that there was a--

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.840
you mentioned Dodd-Frank.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.390
If there were any rules and
regulations out of Dodd-Frank

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:16.890
that were generally applicable
to trading accounts,

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:19.550
it would be applicable to
these trading accounts.

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:23.630
The one big challenge for
big institutions is custody.

01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:26.090
Custody has been a challenge.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:30.050
And what's interesting is
Fidelity, one of the largest

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:31.970
asset managers in
the world, started

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:35.420
something called Fidelity
Digital Asset holding--

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.400
I believe that's the name--

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.400
where they are providing
a custody solution.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.610
Coinbase, which is a
large crypto exchange,

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.530
has a custody solution.

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:48.440
The owner of the New York
Stock Exchange Intercontinental

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.860
Exchange started
Bakkt, B-A-K-K-T.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:56.360
Bakkt is trading crypto markets
but also providing a custody

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.550
solution.

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.810
And why I'm focusing
on custody is

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:04.250
one of the challenges in
this small asset class is

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.800
how to hold the digital asset.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.750
In the traditional
markets, there

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:17.960
are centralized
organizations that

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.510
operate as
clearinghouses but also

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:22.550
as the ultimate
digital custodian.

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:25.729
In the US, it's called DTCC.

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:28.490
And other countries
have different names.

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:34.220
But how do you make sure that,
in essence, the cryptocurrency

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.689
isn't stolen?

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:40.880
These crypto exchanges have had
lots of stolen cryptocurrency

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.380
because once you
steal what's called

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:46.100
the private key,
effectively the password,

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.740
you have the digital asset.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.862
What was Luke's
question earlier?

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:54.550
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of cryptocurrency,

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:58.165
I know you teach in H4, the
cryptocurrency class, which

01:08:58.165 --> 01:08:59.540
I don't have the
luxury of taking

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.529
but [INAUDIBLE]
have the opportunity

01:09:01.529 --> 01:09:05.520
to take next semester
or next year.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.649
My question is then, is
that because of the security

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:12.420
that Robinhood does
not implement customers

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:16.500
the option to buy US
equity with Bitcoin

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.029
overseas, because
they would allow

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:21.180
them to jump over its
respective nations

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.970
ethics regulations, i.e.

01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:26.069
Chinese customers
or Korean customers

01:09:26.069 --> 01:09:27.662
who want to invest in ONG--

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:28.370
GARY GENSLER: I--

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:29.990
AUDIENCE: --buy low,
sell high with Bitcoin?

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.240
GARY GENSLER: Yes, Luke.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.620
I'm going to answer briefly.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.240
I think the regulation for any
one platform like Robinhood

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.260
around cryptocurrencies
is a bit challenging

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:45.600
because in many
jurisdictions, we have not

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.160
gotten to a place
where you can feel

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.689
confident we have a
robust investor protection

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:53.640
regime on cryptocurrency.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.070
And in fact, in
most jurisdictions,

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.570
it's pretty shaky.

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:01.590
It's pretty still undeveloped.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:03.570
I'm talking about
investor protection.

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:06.180
So Robinhood may
have made a choice,

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.640
look, if you're going
to trade, you're

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.430
going to trade Fiat currency
versus buying and selling

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:15.330
stocks.

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:17.850
And that would be an
appropriate business decision

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:20.970
that they made until
there is a much more

01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:25.920
robust and satisfactory
both investor protection

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.180
and also guarding
against illicit activity.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.820
Cryptocurrency started
and emanated out

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:38.700
of a little bit of an off
the grid cypherpunk movement.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.130
And I use the word accurately.

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:43.740
Cypherpunk was a mailing
list that Satoshi Nakamoto

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.880
uploaded that eight-page
paper on 12 years ago.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:53.650
And though you can track
Bitcoin transactions,

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.590
a lot of use of Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies

01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:01.210
has been to avoid the
censorship and the watchful eyes

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:02.920
of the official sector.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.770
And so I would imagine--

01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:07.540
I've not talked to
Robinhood-- that they

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.170
would be aware of that.

01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:12.700
And they would just feel
as both a legal matter

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.640
and for reputational
reasons, better not

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.800
to go there unless
there is a more

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.560
robust support for that system.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.060
ROMAIN: And Nadia had
her hand up for a while.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.917
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.602
ROMAIN: Nadia?

01:11:29.602 --> 01:11:30.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.280
I actually have two questions
on wealth management FinTech.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.190
So the first
question, what do you

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:39.580
think more important for wealth
management FinTech to grow?

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.350
Is it the inclusion
part, meaning

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:45.160
like low minimum deposit,
or the user experience part?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.260
That is for the first questions.

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.990
And for the second
question, given the growth

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:53.170
of past management
feature like Wealthfront,

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:56.890
do you think now customers
prefer a simpler product rather

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:58.907
than more complicated product?

01:11:58.907 --> 01:12:00.740
GARY GENSLER: So there's
a lot there, Nadia.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.540
I'm not sure what--

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.430
but I think that the Betterments
and the robo advisors,

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.080
I can't separate the two.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.570
When you're saying, is it
more about user interface,

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:17.210
is it more about pricing, maybe
somebody better than I could,

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:18.680
but I think it's about both.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.030
I really do think that.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:27.280
I think that they have provided
a lower price point, which

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.550
is really important.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:31.120
But if it were only that,
if somebody had just

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.820
put out an advertisement,
I'm going to give you

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.700
wealth advice for a
quarter of a point,

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.740
I don't think you could
have gotten adoption.

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:41.260
I think you had to have
that user interface.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:46.910
And I think the two of them
together are really important.

01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:50.290
So it's not just doing
something cheaper,

01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:52.090
because a lot of people
could say, listen,

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:55.090
I'll give you wealth advice
for a quarter of a point.

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:58.450
I think the user experience--

01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.310
these are very private matters.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.890
Sometimes it's just
frankly a little easier.

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:06.970
It's interesting to just
go to a drop down menu,

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:10.310
answer some questions, feel
that I'm getting the advice,

01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:13.060
feel that I'm, yes,
getting low-cost ETFs

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.710
and low-cost advisory fees.

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:18.200
But I think the user
experience goes hand in hand.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.890
And I can't easily
separate them.

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:22.420
Let me just try to wrap up.

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:26.620
And then, Nadia, remind me the
second half of your question

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.840
as I wrap up, because I
want to make a-- we only

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.870
have about 3 minutes.

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:34.660
So I want to just make a point
beyond these crypto exchanges.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.240
There's a bunch of crypto
lending and borrowing.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.270
And why I raise this
is this market, just

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:42.430
like the capital markets,
is starting to say,

01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:44.140
can I lend to crypto?

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.550
Can I borrow crypto?

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:48.530
And why would you do that?

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:50.480
Same reason in the
capital markets.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.180
You lend and borrow
stock sometimes

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.670
because you want to buy
the stocks on margin.

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.200
Or sometimes you
lend it because you

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.410
need to borrow against your
assets to do something else.

01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:04.160
So these markets are
developing that way,

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.990
but the thing that
I wanted to mention

01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:08.570
was this question of
decentralized finance

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.170
versus centralized finance.

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.880
Centralized
traditional finance--

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:19.370
this is a slide that I created
in the last eight months--

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:22.130
has proprietary software,
central clearing,

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.230
all the attributes
that I list here.

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:28.100
The question is, is there
a market just like we

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:33.290
talked about in lending for peer
to peer decentralized finance?

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:37.190
And what we found in
LendingClub and other companies,

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:39.590
they really haven't
stayed decentralized.

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:41.630
They started with this
concept that we'll

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:44.090
be peers lending to peers.

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:46.940
And then what we found is
they've become more marketplace

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.050
platforms.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.840
And platform economics
have taken over.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.150
But there's been this
question, can there

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:57.770
be an open source software built
on blockchain technology that's

01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:59.130
truly peer to peer?

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:02.420
And you will hear
this time and again.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.270
It's a business
concept that I just

01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:08.690
want to prepare you for,
decentralized finance

01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:11.450
versus traditional
finance, usually used

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:14.150
in the context of
blockchain technology.

01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:18.920
And the advocates say blockchain
technology facilitates--

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.770
we can get rid of the big banks.

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:23.570
That is what they might say.

01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:26.060
That's what Satoshi
Nakamoto wrote

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.750
in some of the early emails
and so forth, that we

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:33.170
can disintermediate both
banks and central banks

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:36.770
around cryptocurrency
and the like.

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:38.600
That's the dream.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.600
But the question is
whether network economics--

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.450
whether there's a reason in
capital markets and finance

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:47.810
that you have a hub and
spoke approach rather

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.370
than a decentralized approach.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:52.160
When I say "hub and spoke,"
the New York Stock Exchange

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.460
or London Stock Exchange is
in the middle of the market,

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.470
that the banks, back to
Luke's earlier question,

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:02.090
are sitting there collecting
a net interest margin

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:06.110
and why LendingClub is moved
into a marketplace platform

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:08.270
rather than that peer to peer.

01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:11.150
And so this debate and
this business concept

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:15.830
is a relatively important one,
and it basically goes well

01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:17.735
beyond cryptocurrencies.

01:16:17.735 --> 01:16:18.860
And I wanted to mention it.

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.640
But in cryptocurrencies-- and
this is my last little bit--

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.670
is that there are
DeFi platforms,

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:30.770
decentralized finance
where you can peer to peer

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:32.310
use a crypto exchange.

01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:35.670
Binance, IDEX, Uniswap,
others basically say,

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:39.750
we're not going to have a
central exchange or, more

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:42.660
technically, a central
limit order book.

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.860
But Nadia and I could trade.

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.120
And later Nadia could
trade with Luke,

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.930
and Camillo could trade
with somebody else,

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:51.120
but it's not all centralized.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.310
And similarly,
there's platforms--

01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:55.770
Maker DAO, and
Compound, and Synthetix

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:57.240
are the three big ones--

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.540
that are trying to do that on
crypto lending and borrowing.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:04.530
There is even prediction
marking markets

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:09.490
that are trying to say Nadia can
trade with Luke and make a bet.

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:12.390
Now, the regulatory environment
for these prediction markets

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:16.500
is highly challenged,
and they might

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.340
be doing things that are
not strictly within the law.

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:26.310
But these decentralized
markets are very small.

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:29.310
None of these projects
are really big.

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:31.440
But some of these projects
have a few billion

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.060
dollars in their
crypto lending and.

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.830
Borrowing some of
these exchanges

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:38.130
have a few hundred thousand
dollars a day of trading.

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:39.510
They're not big.

01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:42.480
But back-- it raises
this central question

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.050
of traditional finance
versus decentralized finance.

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:50.040
And I just wanted to capture
that before we signed off

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.590
today.

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.490
We end this lecture sequence
with the most important

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.090
property of expectations,
namely linearity.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.100
The idea is pretty simple.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.780
Suppose that our random
variable, X, is the salary of

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.800
a random person out of
some population.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.680
So that we can think of the
expected value of X as the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.440
average salary within
that population.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.380
And now suppose that everyone
gets a raise, and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.530
Y is the new salary.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.510
And generously, the new salary
is twice the old salary plus a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.170
bonus of $100.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.140
What happens to the expected
value of the salary, or the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.770
average salary?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.640
Well the new average salary,
which is the expected value of

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:06.250
2X plus 100, is twice the
old average plus 100.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.870
So doubling everyone's salary
and giving to everyone an

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.060
additional $100, what it does
to the average is that it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.950
doubles the average and
adds 100 to it.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.900
This is the linearity property
of expectation in one

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.670
particular example.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.550
It's a most intuitive property,
but it's worth also

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.130
deriving it in a formal way.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.420
And the derivation proceeds
through the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.550
expected value rule.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.590
We're dealing here with a
particular function, g, which

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.580
is a linear function.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.570
So we're dealing with a linear
function, ax plus b.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.720
And we're dealing with a random
variable, Y, which is g

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.060
applied to an original
random variable, X.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.090
So the expected value of Y can
be calculated according to the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.580
expected value rule.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.570
It's the sum over all x's of g
of x times the probability of

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.788
that particular x.

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:14.290
And we plug-in the specific form
of the function, g, which

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.390
is ax plus b.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.710
And then we separate the
sum into two sums.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.730
The first sum, after pulling
out a constant of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.975
a, takes this form.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.860
And the second sum, after
pulling out the constant, b,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.110
takes this form.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.460
Now, the first sum is a times
the expected value of X. This

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.560
is just the definition of
the expected value.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.470
As, for the second sum, we
realize that this quantity is

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.430
equal to 1 because it is the
sum of the probabilities of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.460
all the different values of X.
And this concludes the proof

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.050
of the linearity of
expected values.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.580
Notice that for expected values,
what we have is that

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:22.150
the expected value of Y, which
is expected value of g of X,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.930
is this same as g of the
expected value of X. The

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.740
expected value of a linear
function is the same linear

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.829
function applied to the
expected value.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.180
But this is an exceptional
case.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.380
This does not happen
in general.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.470
It's an exceptional function
g that makes this happen.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.630
This property is true for
linear functions.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.040
But for non-linear functions,
it is generally false.

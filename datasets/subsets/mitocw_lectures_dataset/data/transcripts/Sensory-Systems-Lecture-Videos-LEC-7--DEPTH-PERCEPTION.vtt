00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.810
PROFESSOR: All right,
so today our topic

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.500
is going to be depth
perception, which,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.690
as I have mentioned
to you before,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.620
is certainly one of the
most intriguing achievements

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.160
in vision.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.870
Because the impressions
onto the retinal surface

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.560
essentially two dimensional.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.000
And from that, somehow
the brain needs

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.470
to reconstruct the
third dimension.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.850
And what is interesting
about this also,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.300
that even in the most primitive
animals, this is a must.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.280
And so annals with
tiny brains also

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.370
have mechanisms to be
able to calculate depth

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.330
from the information that
comes in through their eyes.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.150
And to demonstrate
that, I have here

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.020
a frog, which has a tiny little
brain like that, has big eyes,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.150
and this frog,
for its existence,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.080
needs to know exactly
where things are in depth.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.820
Because if he doesn't,
he would starve to death.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.830
And so what a frog does
looks something like this,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.405
very crudely.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.870
He will stick out his
tongue, grab a flying insect

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.940
and consume it.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.440
And because of this
incredible capability,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.930
it is a well-adjusted,
healthy animal

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.500
in most parts of the world.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340
Now the big question
then comes up,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.495
how do we carry out
these computations.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.360
What kind of
mechanisms are involved

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.200
in being able to compute
where things are in space,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.830
either in absolute sense
where it is from you

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.870
and in a relative sense
where one object is

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.560
relative to another one.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.000
Now it turns out that this
became such a serious problem,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.010
in the course of
evolution, that actually

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.120
several different
mechanisms have evolved

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.090
to make possible our ability
to see things in depth.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.800
And so when one looks at this as
a list, as a fairly brief list,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.890
we can make a distinction
between so called ocular motor

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.090
cues and visual cues.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.130
The ocular motor cues are
accommodation and vergence.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.575
So if various objects are
at a very distance from you,

00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:49.920
your eyes converge or diverge.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.550
And you your lens gets
thicker and thinner.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.530
And that information can be
utilized in a rather crude way

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.670
to tell you about where things
are in that relative to you.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.166
Now as far as visual
cues are concerned,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.310
the very significant
one we are going

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.160
to talk about quite a
bit, is a binocular cue,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.490
which is called stereopsis
as you all know.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.300
And then we have a whole
bunch of monocular cues motion

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.340
parallax, shading,
interposition, size,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.470
and perspective.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.240
And so we will talk
about many of these

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.110
to give you a sense
of what it is like

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.040
and to give you a sense of what
various brain structures do

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.470
with this as a result
of extensive research

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.550
that had been done in this area.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.220
So now, first of all, let's
talk about stereopsis.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.710
And we talk about
stereopsis, we're

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.970
going to talk about
the basic facts of it,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.330
and then we are going to
have some demonstrations.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.462
First of all, the so
called stereoscope,

00:03:55.462 --> 00:03:59.690
of whichever modern version
that has been handed out to you,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.570
the stereoscope was invented
in the late 19th century.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.170
And when that was done, the
initial approach to this

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.280
was to be able to present
to each eye separately

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.420
an image that was
taken by a camera that

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.829
has two lenses, which are apart
about as much as your two eyes

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.840
are apart.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.930
And each of those
created a separate image

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.429
of what's out there.

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:28.720
And, of course, each eye gets
a very slightly different

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.550
perspective of what's there.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.260
And then when you
present these two images

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.030
that you had collected
separately to each eye,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.830
you get a very strong
sense of real depth,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.670
as you will see
in just a minute.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.420
Now another way to do it,
which nowadays is easier

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.090
because you can
barely ever find even

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.550
one of these two-lens
cameras, even in stores that

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.300
sell ancient materials,
antique stores.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.950
So sometimes what
you do instead,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.550
if you only want to take a
picture of a static image,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.330
that you can take a
camera, put in a track,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.774
and have it take two
pictures in succession.

00:05:11.774 --> 00:05:13.190
And then you can
do the same thing

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.960
as you do with a serial camera.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.390
You can present one to each eye.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.210
OK, so, what we are
going to do now,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.670
we are going to have
a series of demos.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.040
And so we have a handout
for each of you, the paper.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.650
And that you can
keep and take home.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.370
But the stereoscope that
I have for each of you,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.430
that you're going to
have to leave behind,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.650
because I need to use
that in other classes.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.830
So what I want you
to do then, there

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.280
are two pictures
on the first page

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.880
that you put the stereoscope
down onto the page

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.550
so that the vertical
line cuts it in half

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.290
so that one goes into each eye.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.250
And then you put your
head right down to it

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.320
to look into it, all right?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.950
And if you do that, if you
have it properly sectioned,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.075
you're going to have a sense
that that image is actually

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:04.825
three dimensional.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.990
It's an ancient, ancient
old picture on purpose.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.080
But you should still be
able to see it in depth.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.430
So that's the initial thing.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.310
This became quite a parlor
game and for that case,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.570
for many, many decades,
whenever you went to a party,

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.960
they would hand out to you a
stereoscope, a handheld one,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.370
and they would show you
all kinds of images.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.530
And you can even
do this today when

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.690
you get on the internet
to find such displays.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.670
Now, then a very important
discovery was made.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.220
I shouldn't say
discovery, really,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.660
I should say an invention was
made by Bela Julesz who came up

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.855
with a so-called
random dot stereograms.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.520
By the way, don't look at the
bottom one, that just tells you

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.728
what it's going to look like.

00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:59.750
There's nothing to look at
the bottom, the bottom set.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.820
Now if you look
in the middle set,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.250
that looks like a
random dot stereogram.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.130
And the idea here was that
the only cue that you provide

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.300
is stereo cue, nothing else.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.160
It's pure.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.150
And so what can
be done here, you

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.540
can take a section here,
or the same on each side,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.814
and simply move a few pixels,
those images as a unit, over.

00:07:23.814 --> 00:07:26.230
And when you do that, they're
going to stick out in depth.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.430
So now take you stereoscope
and look in the middle display,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.770
and you look through it,
you should see something

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.130
sticking out in depth.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.000
And the first question I'm going
to ask you is how many of you

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.020
can see something
stick out in depth?

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.920
What do you see?

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.730
You see

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.680
AUDIENCE: A square.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.680
PROFESSOR: A little
square sticking out?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.820
All right, so now, don't try
to look at the bottom one.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.140
That simply tells you what the
procedure was in that center

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.630
section where you see
the square sticking out.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:09.130
The pixels were moved a few
steps inward from both the left

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.623
and to the right creating
what is called a disparity.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.480
And that's what the brain
then can calculate for depth.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.190
So now to provide you
with the acid test,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.360
go to the second page.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.330
Now you look at the
second page, everybody

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.530
see the letter on top?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.840
You don't even have to look
through the stereoscope,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.534
obviously you see
the letter E, right?

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.890
That's because that
section is made darker.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.690
But now if you do the same thing
at the bottom, the only cue

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.860
you have is the disparity cue.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.065
And the question comes up,
what letter do you see there?

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.390
And let me just add, this can be
used as a quick, general test.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.246
You can present
these two subjects,

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:03.620
and if it can present a whole
bunch of different letters,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.050
and if they can see the letters,
that means they can see stereo.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.150
If they cannot see the letters,
then it looks like they may not

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.350
see stereo.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.710
Now let me add one
other fact here.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.420
As you move these progressively
closer to each other like this,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.050
you increase the disparity.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.645
And that causes the image to
be seen at increasing depths.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.570
Our sensitivity is
so great that when

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.410
you look at this on a
computer, a standard computer,

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.750
if you move those
images just one

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.190
pixel from the left
to the right, then

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.240
from right to the left,
you will see it in depth.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.165
And even monkeys can see
as small step as one pixel.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.690
So now how many
of you can tell me

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.076
what was the letter
at the bottom there?

00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:51.576
AUDIENCE: H.

00:09:51.576 --> 00:09:52.730
PROFESSOR: H, H, good.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.660
Anybody not being able
to see the letter?

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.210
Everybody sees it.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.300
Well, you guys are lucky.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.080
Because there are a
significant number

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.780
of people in the world
who lack stereopsis,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.330
something like 5% to
10% of the population

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:14.260
lacks stereopsis for
a variety of reasons.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.200
We'll talk about that
a bit more later.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.450
But one is sometimes
you're born,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.200
and you're amblyopic in one eye.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.100
Sometimes you are
strabismic, which

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.340
means that your two
eyes are not aligned,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.080
which in commonplace
language is often

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.410
called as being cross
eyed or wall eyed.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.220
Those types of
people very seldom

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.880
will have stereoscopic
depth perception,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.035
even after it's
corrected, especially

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:51.470
if the correction is made by the
time you're 8 or 10 years old,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.660
the correction won't help.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.400
It has to be done
much, much earlier.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.800
All right, so that then
is the very, very basics

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.520
of the stereo procedures.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.720
And now another
procedure that had

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.040
been developed more
recently is one

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.100
which is called the
auto stereogram.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.610
So then if you go to the next
page, and what you want to do

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.480
is you want to look at
this horizontally like that

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.530
with the T on top.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.280
And then just look at it at
sort of, I don't know, maybe

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.540
about 20 inches from you,
normal reading length.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.460
And what you want to do
is to look beyond it.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.040
So stare beyond it.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.600
And if you keep doing
that for a while,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.750
you will suddenly see an image,
a three-dimensional image,

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.550
as this comes actually from
a book called The Magic Eye.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.120
There are several
magic eye books

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.990
in which all kinds
of displays are

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.820
done using these
auto stereograms.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.820
Does everybody see-- who
can see what's sticking out?

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.009
OK, what do you see?

00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:01.050
AUDIENCE: Was it a shark?

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.450
PROFESSOR: You see a shark?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.110
OK.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.590
Now let me see if any
of you don't see it.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.640
Keep staring at it.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.170
Look beyond it.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.190
Another thing that
helps, if you look at it,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.200
bring it a little
closer to you so you

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.590
can look beyond it
easier, gradually

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.910
move it back and forth.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.900
And if you're patient,
eventually you

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.970
may be able to do this.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.410
The reason this is
difficult is because you

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.960
have to uncouple the
vergence in your two eyes.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.565
You have to look
beyond it slightly.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.850
And, in fact, that is
one of the reasons why

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.980
testing people for
stereopsis, an auto stereogram

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.210
is not a very good procedure.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.160
Whereas virtually everybody
can use a stereoscope

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.020
without any trouble.

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:50.240
AUDIENCE: That's so cool.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.685
PROFESSOR: Did you
get it finally?

00:12:51.685 --> 00:12:53.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's so cool.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah, all
right so, if anybody

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.180
is really interested in
this auto stereograms

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.440
is I say go to the
store, the bookstore,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.090
and get one of those
magic eye books.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.320
They're just a lot of fun.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.050
And you can just
leaf through it.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.670
You don't even have to buy
the book, just look through it

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.720
at the store.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.010
And you'll see one interesting,
clever image after the next.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.490
All right, so that's
the stereoscope.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.660
And now let me
explain to, I think

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.430
I've mentioned this briefly
before, the principles involved

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:30.530
behind being able to see
stereoscopic depth perception.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.010
And what I've mentioned
to you before was

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.370
that if you have the
two eyes fixating

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.114
at a particular distance, if you
then draw a circle around that,

00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:42.030
that's sometimes called
a Veith-Muller circle,

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.620
or the sometimes called a
horopter, then any target,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.400
like this one here, will
hit equivalent points

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.840
on the retinal surface of
the left and right eyes.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.770
However, if you
do the same thing,

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.620
and you put a target
either beyond or closer

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.430
than the Vieth-Muller
circle, then they're

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.390
going to hit nonequivalent
points on the retinal surface.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.920
So then by nonequivalency, we
can do this and calculate this

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.940
as to where the
image falls relative

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.960
to the central fixation
spot in the foveola.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.780
And so then, when these
nonequivalent points are hit,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.410
somehow the brain can
measure this nonequivalence.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.690
And that is then
converted into an estimate

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.650
of where things are in depth.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.490
Now the idea behind
this was that

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.150
these nonequivalent
points, that you

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.230
have on the retinal surface,
can connect in the cortex

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.980
to single cells.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.910
So they have a cell in the
cortex that is binocular,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.310
by virtue of the
fact that inputs

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.590
from the left and right eyes.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:56.765
But they don't necessarily have
to come from equivalent points.

00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:59.080
They can come from
nonequivalent points.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.030
And that may be then
the mechanism whereby

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.640
it can tell you the
degree of nonequivalence,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.720
and, therefore, convert
that into depth.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.710
And, therefore, there
could be single neurons

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.210
in the brain that are
selective to certain depths.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.630
And so people began to do all
kinds of experiments with this.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.340
And the way these
experiments were done

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.080
is you presented
images separately

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.850
to the left eyes and right eyes.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:32.080
And you could then present them
to both eyes at the same time

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.940
and vary the amount of
disparity systematically

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.390
to see what kind
of tuning function

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.130
you would get in the cortex.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.960
So this, some of the most
beautiful work of this

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.650
was done by a person
called John [? Porgio ?]

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.970
And I will tell you briefly
about some of his experiments.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.450
So here we go with then.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.670
We're going to look at
the neural responses,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:16:00.235
neural responses in V1 as
initially done in the monkey.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.410
So here's an example of a cell.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.703
We have here different
degrees of disparity.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.840
And we have the
neuron responding

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.480
each time they're
four repeated trials.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.730
And you can see the action
potentials by these dark lines

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:21.580
here.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.700
And what you do is you move
the stimuli back and forth

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.320
across the two eyes, the
way it's actually done,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.130
you have a mirror.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.410
And then you have two
in this experiment.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.480
You have two monitors, one to
the left and one to the right.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.264
And then you can set
it up almost exactly

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:39.305
the same as what you would
do with a stereoscope.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.810
So this particular cell,
as you can readily see,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.130
responds best when
there's zero disparity.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.330
Now by contrast, here is a
cell that responds vigorously

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.800
at the far disparity and
not to the close one.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.010
So then, when you do this, you
can study hundreds of cells

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.730
to see what kinds
of distributions

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.471
you have in the cortex for
different degrees of disparity,

00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:10.054
cell activity.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.510
Now again, this
hearkens back to what

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.010
I talked about with
respect to color vision

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.680
where the question came up,
if you want to see color,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.670
how many receptors
would you need that peak

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.220
at different wavelengths, right?

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.300
And one idea was that maybe you
need as many photo receptors

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.290
as there are colors.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.410
But in the end, it turned
out that we have only three

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:36.440
of them.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.430
And on the basis of that, we
can recreate all the colors out

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.280
there.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.590
Now the same thing
applies to stereopsis.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.450
So when this was
done systematically,

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:50.170
here's an example of
the tuning functions.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.990
This one here is the
same, very much the same,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.260
as the first figure
I showed you.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.420
And so we have a bunch
of different ones.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.430
And if you then study, as
I've said hundreds of cells,

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.640
you can come up with a
distribution of this.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.060
And what John
[? Porgio ?] came up with,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.405
he thought that there
were four major classes.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.680
And the relative amount
of activity of these four

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.570
major classes then is used
to compute all the very fine

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.020
differences in depth.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.370
So there's a right on one.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.730
This cell is right
on the fixation spot.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.880
And then you have
near and far cells.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.920
And you have some
in between cells.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.720
Initially he thought
there were four classes.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.670
Some people argue that
there may be as many as six.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.030
But at any rate,
there's a limited number

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.190
on the basis of which
you can calculate

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.960
almost an unlimited
number of depths,

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.590
which is quite remarkable.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.550
All right, so now, what
you can next turn to

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:56.740
is to ask the question to what
degree do various extrastriate

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:02.140
areas contribute to
stereoscopic depth perception.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.390
And some people
thought that this

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.590
is a unique function
for area MT,

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.620
some people argue
that maybe it's

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.940
area V4, and so experiments were
done in which it was examined

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:23.920
to what degree stereoscopic
depth deception is altered when

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:31.180
you eliminate, say, area MT
or you eliminate area V4.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.725
So that is what's been done.

00:19:34.725 --> 00:19:36.350
And you can think
about it for a minute

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.070
and say, well,
what do you think?

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.160
What do you think would
happen in a monkey

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.300
once you no longer had area V4?

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.950
What you think would happen
if the monkey no longer had

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.535
area MT?

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.990
Well, the results were
actually quite surprising.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.720
And they're shown here,
same experiment as before.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.645
The Bela Julesz random
dot stereograms.

00:19:57.645 --> 00:20:00.060
And then you're presenting
one of four locations

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.090
of however many
little area where,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.640
like little square,
that's sticks out in depth

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.470
and you vary the amount
of depth that sticks out

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.830
by varying the
number of pixels you

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:17.700
moved the images
into this place.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.520
And when that was
done systematically,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.680
this is what was found.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.830
It was found that neither
V4 lesion nor an MT lesion

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.070
cause a significant deficit.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.060
The only deficit
that was significant

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.660
had to do with a
response latency.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.660
And as I should have
mentioned earlier,

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.620
like when we talked
about the frog, one

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.090
of the very important things
about processing depth,

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.440
again, is to be able
to do it quickly.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.380
So when you have that's frog
and the fly is flying along,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.640
he has to be very
quick to compute it

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.860
so that he can catch it,
right, as you had seen.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.090
So in this case,
what you see here,

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.960
that there is about a 20
millisecond difference

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.700
after V4 lesion, increase in
latency, and quite a bit more,

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.090
almost 40, 30, 40
after and MT lesion.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.510
So that contributes to some
aspect of depth processing

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.100
in terms of being
able to do it quickly.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.840
But neither the MT or V4
are unique in processing

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.820
stereopsis.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.190
It looks like that
it is processed

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.180
in several different
areas in the brain

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.560
and inspire conjoint
computation that you

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.290
can arrive at the actual depth.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.890
And it's by virtue of
that joint computation

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.345
that you can do
this very quickly.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:49.970
So now you come to the
next important depth

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.380
cue, which is called
motion parallax.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:01.440
This one is a capacity
that we had acquired

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.160
in the course of
evolution, which

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.800
is extremely potent
and powerful.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.170
And it's based on a very
simple physical fact.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:16.274
And the physical fact it that
either when you are in motion,

00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:17.690
or something in
the environment is

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:23.100
in motion, the rate at
which these images travel

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:29.330
across the retinal surface is
heavily distance dependent.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.120
And so let me demonstrate
this concretely for you.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.010
Here we have an
eye that's fixed.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.780
It's always looking
straight ahead.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:43.680
And we have two rods
here, sorry, just one rod,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.460
that we are going to move into
position gradually from here

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.420
to here, and then back up
as shown by the arrows here.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.300
And we examine the
range over which

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.790
these near and far and
middle objects move

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.720
across the retinal surface
when you engage in this motion

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.160
and the eye is stable.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.020
And you can see that
the far object moves

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.685
over a much shorter distance
than the near object.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.720
This you can readily do it
yourself in an experiment.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.660
You can stick out your thumb and
move your head back and forth.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.330
And you see that your thumb will
move a lot more than the object

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.330
that you're looking at.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.070
So now the same thing also
applies when you actually

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.310
are engaged in the eye
movements, which of course you

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.420
do all the time.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.790
In this case, they eye is set up
so that it's fixated initially

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.020
on this object and
then tracks it to here

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.560
and then tracks it back.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.830
And when you do that, you
get the same kind of effect,

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.460
namely that the distance over
which a far and a near object

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.080
move is quite different.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.280
The near object moves over
much, much greater distance

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.290
than the far object, even
though the eyes are tracking.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.060
So this, then, being
a basic physical fact,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.780
was then used in the
course of evolution

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.350
to create mechanisms that are
sensitive to this differential

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.850
motion.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.790
And, of course, because
of the rate of motion

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.320
also varies a little
bit, it became

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.000
possible to create mechanisms
to make that computation

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.180
to tell you where
things are in depth.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.420
So here I'm going to show
you an actual demo of this

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.620
to make it clear to you.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.100
In this case, again, we have
a bunch of random dots, much

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.280
like in the Bela Julesz
random dot stereograms

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.890
but just a single one.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.900
And everybody agrees
there's no depth here.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.345
Is there any depth?

00:24:44.345 --> 00:24:45.300
Do you see any depth?

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.130
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.230
going to set this image
into rocking motion.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.090
And when I do this,
almost instantly, you're

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.560
going to see something in depth.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.230
Are you ready?

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.210
So what you see here is
are three levels, right,

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.320
very clearly.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.350
In milliseconds, in 20
milliseconds, you can see this.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.260
And let me explain to
you why you see this.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.550
If, OK, let me go
back and do it again.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:21.810
If I keep this stable, you can
see that the dots move over

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.250
a great distance here,
a lesser distance

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.770
here, and practically
not at all here.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.470
So there is a
differential motion.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.700
And the greater the motion,
the closer the image

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.760
is in your analysis.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.300
So that's called
motion parallax.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.040
And then what you
can do actually,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.346
you can play all kinds
of games, do experiments

00:25:45.346 --> 00:25:48.990
in which you can present
this kind of image.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.700
You can put this into each
of the eyes separately.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.790
And you can present
this image alone

00:25:54.790 --> 00:26:01.240
or you can present it paired
with disparity for stereopsis.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.970
And you can do each separately
or you can do the two together.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:16.060
So let's now first summarize
the essence of motion parallax.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.710
To derive depth information
from motion parallax,

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.480
neurons are needed that
provide information

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.380
about velocity and
direction of motion

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.190
and perhaps also about
differential motion.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.710
Secondly, the
majority of V1 cells

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.240
are direction and
velocity selective,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.410
as we had discussed before,
and some appear also

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.200
to be selective for
differential motion, which

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.100
I did not mention before.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.630
But, indeed, there are such
cells in the visual cortex.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.410
Now, the third
important point is

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:54.170
that such cells that are
motion selective and direction

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.870
selective and selective
for differential motion

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.960
are very, very common area MT.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.580
So those are some of the
very, very basic facts.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:10.780
And now we can move on and ask
what kind of brain activation

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.730
occurs by stereopsis
and motion parallax

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.180
in normal and serial
blind subjects

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.840
using a recently
developed technique, which

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.940
is magnetic resonance imaging,
functional, functional

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.520
magnetic resonance imaging.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.530
So how do you do
this kind of stuff?

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.000
Well, what you do here,
here's an example,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.180
you have a very
large stereoscope

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.680
with a mirror at the end.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.880
And you have a subject
who is lying down.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.340
And this whole unit, except
not of course that part,

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.000
is put into the magnet.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.200
And we have a magnet
down here at MIT.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.790
Most of you probably
have seen that.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.870
It's on the ground floor.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.990
So you can do this, and then you
can present those images here.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.200
And so the stereoscope
will present two images

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.740
and then you can vary this
by rocking him back and forth

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.140
either to present
only motion parallax

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.860
or present only stereopsis
and to present both.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.515
And so now the question is, this
is a very primitive question

00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:17.070
at this stage, where
in the brain are

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.630
these processes analyzed?

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.110
And so you can find out
what brain areas are

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.770
active by doing this repeatedly
collecting the fMRI data

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.140
and then printing
them out and looking

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.190
at them to see what happens.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.810
So I'm going to show you
a couple examples of that.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.710
Here is the basic
figure that the person

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.340
sees but done in such a
way that you can see it.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.280
Of course, he doesn't
see anything like this.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.440
He just sees different depths.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.400
There are one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.100
seven different depths here.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.610
And this rocks back and forth.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.110
And then you can, as I
say, present this only

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.830
with differential motion
or you can present it only

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.870
with disparity or you
can present it with both.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.107
And then finally, as a
control, what you do is

00:29:08.107 --> 00:29:09.190
you can do the same thing.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.300
But you don't have
any depth of any sort.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.810
You just have a flat surface
rocking back and forth.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.130
And then when you
do data analysis,

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:21.070
you actually subtract the last
one from the rest of the data

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.280
so that you're not looking at
the data for the activation

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.840
just by the spots but
for the activation that's

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.390
specific for stereopsis
or motion parallax.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.090
So now if you do
this experiment,

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.770
here's an example
of a normal subject

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.440
and a stereobind subject.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:42.100
And we have here a sagittal cut
adding up the images sideways.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.740
And what you see here, this is
posterior cortex, of course.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.430
Here in the normal subject,
when you present only motion

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.180
parallax, you only
analyze motion parallax.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.890
But you have a huge amount of
activation in the visual areas.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.040
And then if you
do the same thing

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.170
when you do a binocular
stereopsis only,

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.465
you also get a great
deal of activation,

00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:05.915
in quite similar set of areas.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.770
And then the big
crucial test comes up.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.320
What happens if you present
the stereo under monocular

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.860
conditions when you
don't see stereo?

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.470
And if you do that, using this
same calculation procedures,

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.530
there is no brain
activation here.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.940
And, therefore, what we see here
is due, indeed, to the analysis

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.970
that we do for stereopsis.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.790
Now if you do the
same experiment

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:38.275
in a stereoblind subject who
has been tested, on tests

00:30:38.275 --> 00:30:43.150
similar we had shown you,
when that person even

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.190
looks at it under
binocular conditions,

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.660
there is no brain
activation meaning

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.540
that this person doesn't have
any mechanisms in the brain

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.400
to analyze stereopsis.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.970
Now the fortunate
thing is that we

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.380
have these several
different mechanisms

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.680
for depth perception.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.190
And so people who are
stereoblind and have

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:10.320
no analysis for disparity, they
can still see depth reasonably

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.490
well.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.700
And, indeed, they can get
driver's license and all

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.690
that, because we have all these
other mechanisms that include,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.520
that we have talked
about, motion parallax.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.830
So that then is one
way of looking at it.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.370
Now the other way to look at it,
especially when I ask as well,

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.600
are the same brain areas
doing both or what.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.660
And so what you
can do is instead

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.410
of doing a sagittal section,
you can take sections coronally

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.240
like bang, bang,
bang, bang like that

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.860
and see what that looks like.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.130
And here's an example in which
I've isolated the stereo.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.830
And here are a
bunch of sections.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:54.435
And this shows the
activation for stereopsis.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.084
You can see there are
all kinds of areas

00:31:58.084 --> 00:31:59.125
that are being activated.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.470
And then if you
do the same thing

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.340
and just look at
the parallax alone,

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.720
here we have the
activation for that.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.980
And then lastly here,
we do both of them.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.180
Now we can go back.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.135
The way to look at
the question, how

00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:21.210
are these two areas, these
two types of depth perception

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.450
analyses, differently
activating in the brain.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.620
And so I'm going to
go back and forth

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.740
between stereo and parallax.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.980
You can see, and that, you
can see the difference.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.600
Now some regions,
which have a perfect

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.285
overlap, and
there's some regions

00:32:36.285 --> 00:32:37.620
that are quite separate.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.480
Notable here are
these areas here,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.060
which are activated by
stereo but not by parallax.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.190
So this then can provide
you with an initial idea

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.490
that there are some brain
areas in which both of these

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.090
are analyzed together.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.950
And there's some
brain areas in which

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.760
are uniquely analyzed for either
stereopsis or motion parallax

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.260
alone.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.460
Now this tells you where it
takes place in the brain.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.660
But how it takes place requires
a totally different approach.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.600
Namely, the most
comfortably to record

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.650
from individual neurons
in various areas

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.750
just like I had shown
you that nice work done

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:24.500
by John [? Porgio ?] recording
from the one demonstrating

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.980
there that there are disparity
selective neurons that

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.940
are tuned that then provide
the hardware, if you will,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.470
for being able to analyze
stereoscopic depth.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.100
So that then summarizes
what I wanted

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.480
to tell you about
motion parallax.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.990
And now we are going
to go on and talk

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.410
about yet another
important depth

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:56.900
cue that is utilized by the
brain, which is called shading.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:07.550
Now remember that our ability to
use light to illuminate things

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.020
is something that was
practically nonexistent

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.400
for endless millions of years.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.340
And so because of that,
both animals and us,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.920
we have to heavily
rely on information

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.610
based on light coming from
the sun, coming from above.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:29.270
And shading is based on those
millions of years of evolution

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:32.500
utilizing the fact that
most of the light that

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.810
illuminates things
comes from above.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.300
So there are all kinds
of nice examples of this.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.550
And here is one of them.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:45.900
What you can do here is you
can take a bunch of disks

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.330
and set them up so.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.139
You can do this on a computer
to make the upper part

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.219
light and the lower part
dark or the other way

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:55.100
around, the upper part
dark and lower part light.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.990
And all of you readily
can see that these images,

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.130
the first and third row, seem
to be protruding towards you.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:05.780
And the images in the second and
fourth row seem to be receding.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.680
Now that is because the
brain is interpreting

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:17.456
that on the basis of the fact
that the light at least used

00:35:17.456 --> 00:35:18.830
to come predominantly
from above.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:26.830
So that is the basic
arrangement for seeing depth.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.470
And now I'm going to give
you some demonstrations

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:35.370
to indicate that this cue
is actually quite powerful,

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.580
even when you would not
necessarily expect it to be.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:47.930
So these shading cues have
also been extensively used

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.460
in art work to provide
an impression of depth.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.200
And I will show
you some examples

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.340
that will give you a
sense of how that is done.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.060
So let me make one more point
before I proceed that namely it

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.320
is, indeed, the
degree of illumination

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.460
that's crucial here.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.330
We have the same change
from red to, sorry,

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:14.090
from some greenish to yellowish.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.680
And you have no sense of
depth here whatsoever.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.444
In other words, you do need
the shading information,

00:36:21.444 --> 00:36:22.860
meaning the amount
of light that's

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.550
being reflected from
various surfaces, that

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:29.950
is crucial for perceiving depth.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.240
So now what we
are going to do is

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.570
we are going to present a series
of slides that will highlight

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.850
the power that shading has
for the perception of depth.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.460
So here is an example
of how we do this.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.240
And the reason I'm
showing this in some

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.630
detail because if you really are
interested in stuff like this,

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.800
you can do all this
on your own computer.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.200
You can play games,
endless games with it.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.150
You can spend hours and
hours having a lot of fun

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.940
thinking about how depth
works on the basis of shading.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.050
So what you have here are
a whole bunch of disks.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.410
And each of these can
be shaded differently

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.920
by many different
computer programs.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.070
So that's what you can do.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.430
That's the basics.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.770
So now what we can do
is we can play a game.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.870
And we can say, present just
two different objects here.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.570
But we're going to present them
repeatedly on a big display.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:35.090
And then we can shade these
differently as we please.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.530
So here is a whole
bunch of them.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:42.090
And all the rows, this, the
first, third, and so on rows

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.210
are the same shape
and the second, fourth

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.150
and so on are the other
shape, these two shapes.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.563
So we only have two shapes
here that are juxtapositioned.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:57.595
Now what we can do is say, well,
this is a peculiar sensation.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.230
I have a vague
sense that there's

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.520
something maybe in
the third dimension.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.900
But it's not too well
defined, because this

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.990
is not in accordance with
the rules and laws of shading

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.850
of light coming from above.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.440
So now what we can do
instead, we can selectively

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:22.280
shade these to be in accordance
with the rules of light coming

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.460
from above to create
shading and depth.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.620
And when you do that,
here's an example of that.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.070
What you can see here is
a very compelling image

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:36.000
of these protruding elements,
sort of protruding to the left,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.500
right?

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.850
Everybody see, have a
strong sense of depth here?

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:45.500
So now what you can do
is you can play with it

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.510
and decide, well,
can we do something

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.250
that, keeping the
very, very same shapes,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.220
shade them differently
and see what

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.050
it does to our
perception of depth.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.596
And so what we are
going to do next

00:38:56.596 --> 00:38:58.470
is we're going to take
each of these elements

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.380
here, the same ones
here, and we're

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.000
going to reverse the contrast.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.710
You see the contrast
here on top is white

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.250
and the bottom is black.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.780
So we're going to
reverse that contrast.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.520
And when we do so, the question
is what are you going to see.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.600
And if you do that,
low and behold,

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.540
you still have a
strong sense of depth.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.570
But it's a very confusing sense.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:23.430
You may see sometimes these
objects pointing to the left

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.720
and sometimes to the right.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.820
It's unstable, because you're
confusing those computations

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.200
that have evolved
over millions of years

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.140
for interpreting depth
in terms of shading.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.910
Now you can play also
some additional games.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.080
You can make this even more
complicated, make more changes,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.324
and here is another one.

00:39:42.324 --> 00:39:43.740
You still have a
feeling of depth.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.540
But it's totally confusing.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.360
It's very hard.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.610
You can't organize it
any way, because it

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.310
is not in accordance
with the law of light

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:55.300
coming from above
to a real object.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.010
And lastly, you
can also make this

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.500
so that it would be in
accordance with the laws.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.350
But you can change
it around so that you

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.040
get a completely
different perception,

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.430
a strong sense of depth.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.030
It's still the very,
very same elements

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.280
that you had seen before.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.590
But now the shading is
done, again, differently.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.260
And then now gives you,
again, a unified sense

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:20.050
of a display that
is not conflicting.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.430
Because in this case, it's
in accordance with that

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.430
some of the basic
principles of shading.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:32.310
So now, what we can do next,
having talked about stereo

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.620
and we have talked
about shading,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.550
is to look at some
more of the demos.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.100
So let's go back
to the stereoscope.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.250
And let's go back
to the handouts.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:50.380
And so if you now come to the
next page that has a heading

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.210
called stereo and shading.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.790
So, again, take the
stereoscope and we

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.430
are going to look
at these in steps.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.360
So let's start by looking
at the top display

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.840
first, which is
called stereo only.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.330
So if you look at
that, first of all,

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.170
if you just look at it
without the stereoscope,

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.630
you see pretty much a
sort of flat display

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.250
of a truncated pyramid.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:23.240
Then if you put the stereoscope
there and look through it,

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.230
you should see, if you look
at it for a little while,

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.730
that one of those
sticks out towards you

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.280
and the other one
seems to recede.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.145
Does everybody see that?

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.830
So let's stop there
for a minute, because I

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.360
want to add one more
fact here, which

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.590
I should have mentioned earlier.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:47.620
So what you do here
is-- so you have

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.500
these two displays like that.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.430
And you have one image here
and another image here.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.980
When you-- this is
greatly exaggerated,

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.990
these coming together like this.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.650
That means it's
going to stick out

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:03.200
towards you as you look at it.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:10.350
But if you do the
opposite like that,

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.460
they're further apart
than the rest of them.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.935
Then actually you
see it receding.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.800
And that's why, if you now
take away the stereoscope

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.640
and look at it, you can see
that the top left image is

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.800
in each, or facing
towards each other,

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.780
whereas the other ones are
facing away from each other.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.800
And that's what creates, that's
what the brain interprets,

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.060
as protruding versus receding
using the stereoscope.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.570
So that is very
similar, in a way,

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.470
to what happens with shading.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:48.300
So now if you look
at the second image

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.060
there, first without the
stereoscope, what you see here,

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.130
again, is one that
sticks out just

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.920
like in the original display.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.100
And the rest of
them are receding.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.090
That's because the shading,
the one that sticks out

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.360
is light on top and
dark on the bottom.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.380
And it's the obverse
for the other ones.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.410
Now if you do the
same thing looking

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.420
through the stereoscope,
what you will see

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.300
is still some degree of depth,
but it's not very pronounced.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:22.111
Because there is no
corresponding disparity

00:43:22.111 --> 00:43:22.610
information.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:28.960
But now if you look
at the third display,

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.500
where stereo and shading are
in harmony, then what you see

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.880
is an extremely
compelling dramatic sense

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.810
of depth with the top
left one sticking out

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.660
towards you and the
other three receding.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.582
So shading appeared to have
added to the compelling nature

00:43:47.582 --> 00:43:49.665
of the depth that you see
through the stereoscope.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:57.200
Now the last image in here is
that we put stereo and shading

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.040
and conflict with each other.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.932
And when you do that, you can
look at it, first with just one

00:44:02.932 --> 00:44:04.140
eye, then with the other eye.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.695
When you look at it with both
of them, you, for a while,

00:44:06.695 --> 00:44:08.540
you see something unstable.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.800
And when you see it
well, eventually, you

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.330
realize that there
is a conflict there

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:17.880
because of the
shading and the stereo

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.720
being in opposition
to each other.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.990
Now then, this kind of effect,
if you go to the next page,

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.250
we're going to go now to
page five, six, and seven.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.380
Again, what you
need to do here is

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.850
to look at it sideways
with the F's on top.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:50.260
And when you look at this, those
of you who can use your eyes so

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.930
that they are divergent,
and you look beyond it,

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.240
then this is very much like,
or it is the same actually,

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.770
as an auto stereogram.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.680
So if you look at this for a
while, and you look beyond it,

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.570
eventually it's going to gel.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.500
And when it gels,
what you should

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.180
see is where the
F's are, the images

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.475
are protruding towards you,
and the others are receding.

00:45:12.475 --> 00:45:14.610
Now it may take you awhile.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.810
It's much more difficult
than what we just

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.430
did with the stereoscope.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.860
But you should be
able to see that.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.580
How many of you are able to
actually see those images?

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.360
A little bit di-- move it back
and forth a little bit slowly.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.940
And maybe eventually
you manage it.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.410
So as I say, where
the F's are you

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:44.020
see these images-- these
truncated pyramids protruding

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.980
towards you.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.070
And the rest of
them are receding.

00:45:50.989 --> 00:45:52.900
If you have difficulty
seeing this,

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.670
I'm not surprised, because
it takes a lot of practice.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.530
But once you get
a sense of it, I

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:03.647
think that you will enjoy
doing this and actually

00:46:03.647 --> 00:46:05.105
showing it to some
of your friends.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.760
So then if you go
to the next page,

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.570
there we have added shading.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.270
And the shearing is
the same everywhere.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:22.220
But the stereo cues are not.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.400
Once again, what
happens is that they

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.120
are stereo cues where
the F's are stick out

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.695
towards you much
greater than the others.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.530
They stick out a lot less
because of the added stereo.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:51.990
And then, in the last demo
there, the last page, we

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:56.860
are putting, just like in that
figure with a stereoscope,

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.490
we are putting them into
opposition with each other.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.350
And so when you
look at these, this

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.950
would be very difficult
to see for a while.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:10.740
Because there's a tendency
to see it differently

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.692
for stereo and for
motion parallax.

00:47:15.692 --> 00:47:19.170
And so it's going to
be an unstable percept.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.310
So what you can do then
is you can play around

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:29.220
with this at your leisure and
especially once you become more

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.130
proficient looking at
all the stereograms,

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.420
if you go and get one of these
magic eye books to look at,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.160
you will be able to see
these displays as well.

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:49.370
So now, this is the one was the
first one that I showed you.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.330
As I said, this one, with
the F's, are the ones

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.360
that should stick
out closest to you.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.190
Once you see that, then
you can go on to the next

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:01.636
to add the shading or
subtract the shading from it.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:10.310
So now, an interesting
question that arises

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:20.400
is to what degree are we
able, or are animals able,

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:26.140
to integrate these different
kinds of depth cues.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.270
And in particular,
in this case, you're

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:33.185
going to ask the question, what
about integrating stereopsis,

00:48:33.185 --> 00:48:34.425
parallax, and shading.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.160
So the experiment is
one done on monkeys

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.120
in which you can present
these cues either singly

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.850
or in combination.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:48.380
And we can ask the
question, well,

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.350
does the monkey do better
with one or the other,

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:56.300
or does he integrate really
and does really much better

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.290
when you provide all three cues.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.640
And so here is a procedure.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.700
What you do here, again,
you have a rocking display

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.230
like this, and you
can present this

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.700
either with shading
as shown here

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.440
or with motion parallax where
it rocks back and forth,

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.240
and lastly also with stereopsis.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.330
So if you do that, the results
you get are quite dramatic.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:23.910
What happens is shown here as
a percent correct performance

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.980
and here is the latency
in milliseconds.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:32.510
And it shows that the monkey
does extremely well when

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.400
you present-- this
is percent correct.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.600
This is degrees of disparity.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.390
The monkey does extremely well
when you present all three cues

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.890
and does worse when you present
each of those cues alone.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.050
Even more dramatic
is the fact, and this

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:49.220
is-- I keep coming back to
this, that the ability for us

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.395
to respond quickly to things
is very important for survival.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.500
And here what we can see is
that when you present all three

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.950
cues, performance is much,
much, much, much faster than

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.010
when you present
each of those alone.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.080
And, of course, as
you might expect,

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.150
when you present parallax
only, because that's

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:13.130
motion over time, that
takes the longest to do.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.680
So even though motion
parallax cues are great,

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.330
it became important in
the course of evolution

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.180
to create mechanisms that
can detect these things more

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.195
quickly and more efficiently.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:32.120
So now we come to
yet another cue

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.300
that we know very little about
at the level of the brain

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:40.450
or single units, because
it's so complicated, which

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:41.930
is called perspective.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:45.570
But I want you to just be aware
of it and have a sense of it.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.770
And here is one of
those cartoon examples

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.220
that gives you a very
strong sense of depth.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.510
And you almost cringe.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:54.330
If you were there,
you would worry

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.690
that you would be falling down.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.285
This is done strictly by
virtue of perspective.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.910
It's very similar to what you
encounter all the time when

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.972
you're driving down a road and
the road seems to converge,

00:51:08.972 --> 00:51:10.430
even though you're
not aware of it.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.586
But that's what's happening
on the rental surface.

00:51:12.586 --> 00:51:14.710
Because things further away
are smaller than things

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:16.082
that are close by.

00:51:16.082 --> 00:51:18.040
And that's when you look
down a railroad track,

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.170
the same thing happens,
even though you

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.920
know that the railroad
track is not converging,

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.450
it's going parallel.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.820
But because of the
distances involved,

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.590
that's what falls on the retina.

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:33.220
And you're smart enough to
know that even though that's

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.900
what falls on the
retina, you can

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.070
make the right kind
of interpretation.

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.090
Conversely, you can
also compute the depth

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.270
on the basis of that
kind of convergence.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:44.930
Now here's another example
of that, a much simpler way

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:47.200
that people can do
with experiments.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.890
Here we have a bunch of dots.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:53.000
And we have two basic cues that
have to do with perspective.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.715
One of them is this gradually
decreasing size of these dots.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.220
I should say elongated
disks, if you will,

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.780
and also that they
are converging

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.800
much like a railroad
track converges.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.830
And so we have a
very strong sense

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.160
of having a third
dimension here.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.130
Now the fact that
this is so strong

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:21.030
can be mitigated by
adding a few things here.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:25.150
If you add some more dots,
it's not question as dramatic.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.460
And then if you start
mixing up the sizes,

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.160
you are beginning to lose it.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.910
And then if you
totally mix it up,

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.590
then you have no sense
of that left at all.

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:37.200
So it is that progression
of steps and sizes

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.380
and whatnot that
gives you the sense

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:45.310
of the depth of the images
that you're looking at.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.870
Now here's another
converse example

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:55.370
of this that is an illusory
effect that what you see here

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.770
is three barrels, if you will.

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.380
And this barrel is a lot
bigger than this barrel, right,

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.730
or is it?

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.880
Well, so what we're
going to do here,

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.820
we have an inducing element here
by this hallway, if you will,

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:12.950
with a door at the end.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.200
And we're going to
remove this hallway

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.120
keeping the barrels
exactly as they are.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.900
And if you do that,
low and behold,

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.725
those barrels are
all the same size.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.230
It's induced by virtue
of the surround that

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.100
gives you a false
sense of depth.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:39.700
So now let me show you
another picture because

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.380
of the purpose behind this.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.190
This a picture
that's in a museum

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:47.250
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.375
And it was created by a
fellow called Edward Savage.

00:53:50.375 --> 00:53:53.930
And it's a pretty
unpleasant picture.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.300
But the main reason
I'm showing this to you

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.400
is that there seems to be
very poor sense of depth

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.080
in this picture.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:06.670
Now the reason
this is interesting

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:12.290
is because when artists
began, centuries

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:20.140
ago in the 13th, 12th
centuries, draw things,

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:24.240
they did not have a concept
of an understanding of how

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:29.895
to create depth, a third
dimension, in their drawings.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:34.930
So what they did
eventually, they came up

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:37.060
with a so-called
vanishing point,

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:42.160
and they drew very much
like what we had here.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.620
Lines that converged
at a point and then

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.080
scaled the images
accordingly rather

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.740
than keeping it the same size.

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.180
And that way you got
a good sense of depth.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.290
So now that has a number
of interesting stories

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:03.410
about it that we
are going to discuss

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:07.909
next time you talk about
the perception of shapes,

00:55:07.909 --> 00:55:08.450
OK, patterns.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:13.350
But I will leave that
discussion until that.

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:17.120
What I'm going to do
next, however, I'm

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:26.720
going to try to give you a sense
of how important stereopsis can

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.995
be for the perception
of fine depths.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.860
And so to do that, what I'm
going--I'm going to show you

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.500
actually a film.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:40.600
And here what we have is
a so-called needle test.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.940
What you have here is a
fine needle protruding.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:48.870
And here we have a
bunch of different size

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:54.300
circular openings, a little bit
like a needle, but it's round.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.590
And the task is to take these
one at a time and hang them up.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.900
And one can time how
quickly you can do that,

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.670
or you can make a film to
see how well you can do it.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.940
And then what we
can do is we can

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.020
test the subject under
binocular conditions,

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.460
and test them under
monocular conditions.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:18.060
So I'm going to show you a film
of this, actually two films.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.786
It will just take just
few seconds to do it.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.900
OK, be ready, it's going
to come up in a second.

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:37.820
OK, here's the subject under
binocular viewing conditions.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.870
So that's the condition
under binocular viewing.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:56.510
And now I'm going to show it to
you, same subject, same time,

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:58.090
but with one eye closed off.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.800
So that then just
even looking at it

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.350
without taking any
careful measurements.

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:34.370
It's obvious that
it's much, much

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:38.050
more difficult to thread
a needle under monocular

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:40.700
than under binocular
viewing conditions.

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.530
And so what you can do
is when you go home,

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:47.400
and next time you want
to sew something up,

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.920
try threading the needle with
one eye closed and with the two

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.460
eyes open.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.490
And you will see immediately
what a huge difference it is.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:58.350
And that difference,
therefore, is due

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:02.260
to you're having the
mechanism of steropsis.

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:19.620
Just a few seconds here.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.270
Another test that has been
used in a similar fashion which

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:20.960
allows you to actually calculate
exactly what your error is

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.620
in reaching, you
can have a subject

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.940
sit in front of one
of these touch panels,

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.400
and then do this experiment
either binocularly or

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.245
monocularly.

00:59:31.245 --> 00:59:33.590
And after he presses
this a dot comes up,

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.540
and then the person
has to touch it.

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.020
And you have about 30
or 40 trials like that.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:42.070
And then you have recorded
where the person touched.

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:44.480
And, therefore, you
can calculate the error

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.350
between where we touched
and where the dot is.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.790
And then, again, you
get a huge effect

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.040
between monocular and
binocular viewing conditions.

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.850
Now when you come to
monocular and binocular

00:59:56.850 --> 01:00:00.950
viewing conditions, another
thing important to test

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.580
is to what degree a person
who does or does not

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.300
have stereopsis is capable
of integrating information

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.130
between the two eyes.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:13.530
So to do that, we
have here examples

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.100
of what is called
binocular integration.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.910
So what we do here, again,
you can use a stereoscope.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.370
You look at a monitor.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.940
And this represent the left
eye, this is the right eye.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.500
And you flash these on.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.249
If you integrate this,
this is what you see.

01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:29.790
This would be actually
what you would

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:32.205
show in the control
part of the experiment.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.440
So you see the Star of David.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.390
And if a subject is
shown this, and they

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:42.700
don't see the Star
of David, you worry

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.520
that their ability to integrate
the information between the two

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.530
eyes is deficient.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:51.940
And I would say 90% of the
cases, those people who

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:57.290
are deficient on this
also show major deficiency

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:59.525
in stereoscopic viewing.

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:02.780
Now another way to do
this is an experiment

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.400
in which you can present
two words here, sud and try,

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.690
so the two are separate.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.920
And when you present
them simultaneously,

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.200
you actually see
the word sturdy.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.070
So you ask the subject, please
tell us what do you see.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:18.160
What is it word you see.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.920
And the subject says sud.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.746
And the subject
says try, then you

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:26.010
know that that subject
sees, if he says try,

01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:28.390
he sees mostly with his
right and prefers it,

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.360
doesn't see too well
with his left eye.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.790
If he says sturdy, then
he integrates the two.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.900
And, therefore,
you can safely say

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.661
that this guy has very good
integration between the two

01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:40.160
eyes.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:48.360
So what I would
like to do next then

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.330
is to provide you with any
questions that you have.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:56.172
This was a complicated
topic, that you have,

01:01:56.172 --> 01:01:57.630
and then we are
going to summarize.

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:02.184
Does anybody have a question
about motion parallax,

01:02:02.184 --> 01:02:03.100
stereopsis, and so on?

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.540
Let me maybe add one
more important factor.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.655
Your eyes are separated
only by so many centimeters.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.425
Now, can you think
of an animal where

01:02:18.425 --> 01:02:19.800
there's a much
larger separation?

01:02:21.064 --> 01:02:22.122
AUDIENCE: Hammerheads.

01:02:22.122 --> 01:02:23.455
PROFESSOR: The hammerhead shark.

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:29.170
Yeah, that has a separation
of over a foot between the two

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:29.870
eyes.

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:33.360
And so you could ask the
question, why on earth did

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.460
that animal evolve to such a
huge separation between the two

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:36.960
eyes?

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.565
Well, that brings one to yet
another interesting point.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.080
This I think may have started
during the Second World War.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.460
It was realized that
when you're flying

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.210
over some territory, where
there are all kinds of weapons

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:07.910
and whatnot, which
are well camouflaged,

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.630
that just looking down at
them, you can't see them.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.730
But obviously if you're
going to have a tank

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:23.800
or you're going to have a
gun or other that may be more

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.620
like a cannon, it sticks
out of the ground.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:36.180
So it was discovered that
if you had in your airplane

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.140
two lenses which
are far apart, that

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.510
would greatly magnify the depth.

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.890
You could defeat
that camouflage.

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:45.785
And you could find
those weapons down there

01:03:45.785 --> 01:03:48.160
by virtue of the fact they're
sticking out of the ground.

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:56.710
So the fact then is that the
more you separate the images

01:03:56.710 --> 01:04:00.970
from the two eyes, if you
will, or your two cameras,

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.800
the more likely it is
that you can calculate

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.840
the disparity of information
between the two images.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:16.330
So that then is probably
one of the reasons, not

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:19.050
the sole reason, but
maybe one of the reasons

01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:23.400
why, in some animals, is
an excessive separation

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.530
between the two eyes.

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:28.780
And that brings me to get me
to yet another point, which

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:33.380
is that stereopsis actually
works best at relatively

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.070
short distances, like
threading a needle.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.760
It doesn't work too well beyond,
I don't know, 10 feet or so.

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:46.404
It becomes progressively
less effective.

01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:48.195
But at short distance,
it's very effective.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.590
And so I presume
also many animals

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:58.400
that have to hunt for
food are able to utilize

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.550
the mechanism of stereopsis,
because everything

01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:04.830
is at a close distance when they
hunt for food on the ground.

01:05:06.515 --> 01:05:11.920
And by contrast, when you
talk about motion parallax,

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.535
that works extremely well
over very long distances.

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:21.400
So does anybody have any
questions about motion parallax

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.640
or about steropsis?

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.410
Oh, once again, I'm
crystal clear, huh?

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.610
So, therefore, I
think it's time for us

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.900
to summarize what we
had covered today.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.213
First of all, there
are numerous mechanisms

01:05:37.213 --> 01:05:41.550
that have emerged
for analyzing depth.

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:47.190
And they include the ocular
motor cues, which are vergence

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:51.220
an accommodation and then the
binocular cue of stereopsis

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.969
and then the monocular
cues of parallax shading

01:05:53.969 --> 01:05:54.635
and perspective.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.205
Then you have several
cortical structures

01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.180
that process stereopsis.

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.570
You don't have one
specific brain area

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.020
that uniquely does this.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:10.240
The number of disparities that
are represented in the brain,

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.270
as studies in the area of
the one by John [? Porgio, ?]

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.360
is limited.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.840
And maybe, maybe four,
but there may be six,

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.650
but certainly there are
not a large number of them.

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:24.720
And so it's analogous
to the way things

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.430
had been resolved for us to
be able to process color.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.370
Utilizing motion parallax
for depth processing

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:36.250
necessitates neuron specific
for direction, velocity,

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.150
and differential velocity.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:45.090
Several areas getting V1 and
MT process motion parallax,

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:46.190
which I did not say.

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:51.110
But indeed, if you make
a lesion in area MT,

01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:54.506
you go get a deficit in
motion parallax, even

01:06:54.506 --> 01:06:57.700
thought you don't get a
major deficit in steropsis.

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:01.990
Now, area MT
combines the analysis

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:05.700
of motion parallax,
depth, and flicker.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.960
However, these analyses
are also carried out

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.850
by several other structures
as I've already said.

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:13.100
And lastly, little
is know at present

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.810
about the manner in which
information about shading

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:19.490
and prospective are
analyzed in the brain.

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:23.640
And hopefully, that will
be one of the future tasks

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.170
by neuroscientists.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:30.900
And so if any of you ever
get involved in neuroscience,

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.170
this certainly is
a big open area

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:37.396
that we hope people
will start to analyze.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.800
So that then is the essence of
what I wanted to cover today.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.230
And once again, if any of
you has a question, please,

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:51.560
please don't hesitate to ask.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.490
I'll be very happy
to answer them.

01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:03.750
OK, lastly then, did everybody
sign the attendance sheet?

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:07.470
If not, please come up after the
class and sign your name to it.

01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:09.230
Very good.

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:11.100
So next time then,
we are going to talk

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.530
about pattern perception.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:18.279
And hopefully you will
find that also interesting.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:24.920
MIKE SHORT: OK, guys.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.670
Welcome to the first filmed
and hands-on installation

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.400
of 22.01, Introduction
to Ionizing Radiation.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.450
I'm Mike Short.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.430
I'm the department's
undergrad coordinator.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.500
I'm also your 22.01 instructor.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.630
But I also want to introduce
you to Amelia Trainer

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.360
in the back, who one of the
three TAs for the course.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.490
She took it last year.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.645
Everything is still very
fresh in your head, I bet.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:45.770
AUDIENCE: More or less.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.478
MIKE SHORT: Cool.

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:49.250
So she'll be-- she and
Ka-Yen Yau and Caitlin Fisher

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.360
will be with us all
throughout the term.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990
So if there's something that you
don't like my explanation for,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.390
you've got three people
who just took the course,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.310
and struggled through
my own explanations,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.470
and can say it in
a different way.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.860
So let's start off by taking
your knowledge of physics

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.760
from the roughly 1800s education
of the GIRs, the a General

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.077
Institute Requirements,
up till 1932

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:12.410
when the neutron was discovered.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.243
And I would argue that
this particle is what

00:01:14.243 --> 00:01:16.160
makes us nuclear engineers.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.090
It's the basis behind reactors.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.658
It's what differentiates us
from the high energy physics

00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:22.700
folks and everything,
because we've studied these

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.480
and use them quite a lot.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.260
And so we want to
retrace Chadwick's steps

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.850
in discovering the neutron.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.890
And this is the only
time you're ever

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.080
going to see me have a
bunch of words on a slide.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.450
It's not a presentation
technique I like,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.770
but this paper is awesome in
the clarity and expressiveness

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.510
of him saying I
ran this experiment

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.520
and found something unknown.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.190
I'll use basic conservation
of energy and things

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.130
you learned in 8.01
and 8.02 to prove

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.620
that it has to be a neutron,
that a neutron must exist.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.750
It's elegant and
brilliant, and I want

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.270
to walk you guys through it.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.880
Did any of you get a chance to
read the Chadwick article yet?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.380
OK.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.260
I'll show you where that is,
because hopefully by now you're

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.390
all aware that we have
a learning module site.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.517
It's where I'm going
to post everything.

00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:09.350
It's where you're going
to submit everything

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.107
for the class.

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:11.690
But I'll save to the
end of this class

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.065
to go through the
actual syllabus

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.900
because I want to
get into the physics.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.330
So let's bring your knowledge
from classical mechanics

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.880
and E&M up till about 1895 when
Wilhelm Roentgen used X-rays

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.510
and used them to, well, image
something for the first time

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.170
ever.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.290
Showing the contrast
between bone and tissue,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.540
he was able to illuminate
the bones in a hand.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.060
And then about a year later, the
X-rays got a whole lot better.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.920
So by then, it was known that
there were high-energy photons

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.160
that had differential contrast
between different types

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.730
of material.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.200
A year later, after
the nicer X-ray,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.510
J.J. Thompson
conclusively proved

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.680
that there is an electron
by taking these cathode

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.830
rays, as they were
called at one point,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.190
and sending them through
two charged plates.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.550
And he was able to show
a slight deflection.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.850
So these cathode rays, as they
pass through an electric field,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.565
change direction a little bit.

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:06.940
And from the change
in direction,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.830
you may not know the
mass or the charge,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.220
but you can get the
mass to charge ratio.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.200
Because if you guys remember
from 8.02, from electricity

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.420
and magnetism, as
a charged particle

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.360
passes through an electric
field, it's deflected.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.760
And the amount of that
deflection, or the curvature,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.870
is based on the mass
to charge ratio.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.080
So Chadwick knew that
electrons existed.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.795
This was a known thing, as well
as alpha, beta, and gamma rays.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.670
So the electrons that
came out of the nucleus

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.470
were later renamed beta rays.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.560
And at around the same time,
Ernest Rutherford and Paul

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.380
Villard, working in
Canada and France,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.290
discovered that there are some
heavy charge particles that

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.960
have very little penetrating
power, while Paul

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.860
Villard discovered that there
are some other radiations--

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.490
I think he called it produced
by disintegration of nuclei--

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.490
that have very high
penetrating power.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.120
And they named them
alpha, beta, gamma

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.923
in order of their penetrating
power or their range.

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:04.090
And so it was later figured
out that these were also

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.450
high-energy photons.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.340
So this is something to note is
that gamma rays, x-rays, light,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.770
whatever, it's all photons.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.079
However, once this pops
back up, gamma rays

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.620
emanate from the nucleus.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.140
So when we refer
to a gamma ray, we

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.710
mean a photon that came out
of a nuclear interaction

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.178
or a nuclear disintegration,
not an electron transition.

00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:29.470
So this is one-- this is what
makes a gamma ray a gamma

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.940
ray, is where it comes from.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.010
Otherwise it's a photon.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.510
It behaves just
like any photons.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.470
So what did Chadwick
see in 1932?

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.930
This is the first
one-page article

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.780
that he sent out to Nature to
say, I found something weird.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.100
So he found out that when
you take alpha particles

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.640
from polonium-- so let's say
we had a source of polonium

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.100
sending off alpha particles,
which I haven't told you

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.930
what they are yet.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.260
It emits a radiation of
great penetrating power

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.080
when it hits a
foil of beryllium.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.240
And it was not known
what these things were.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.880
So in goes the
alphas to beryllium.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.270
Something happens,
and something comes

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.080
streaming out that couldn't be
explained by current theories.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.480
It was also noticed
that when hydrogen

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.240
was placed in front of it,
when a piece of hydrogen

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.420
in the form of wax, which
contains a lot of hydrogen,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.360
was put in front of it,
the amount of ionization

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.800
increased, as measured by
what's called an ionization

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.260
chamber and an
oscillograph, nothing

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.150
more than an
almost-sealed chamber,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.180
a piston with some charge on
it that would then deflect.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.970
As it were to pick up
positive or negative charges,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.130
it would move
inwards or outwards

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.180
and send an electrical signal to
something like an oscilloscope.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.250
So this was a way that
you could figure out

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.980
how many ions were
created by this highly

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.130
penetrating radiation
interacting in the ionization

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.390
chamber.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.780
And they estimated that
with the old theories,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.070
if this highly penetrating thing
were a photon or a gamma ray,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.070
it would have to have
an energy of 50 times 10

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.170
to the 6 electron
volts, or 50 MeV.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.770
He said, OK.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.520
Well, if that's to be basically
the experimental observation,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.750
say, a 50 MeV photon must be
responsible for the ionizations

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.642
that we saw.

00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:31.350
And so again, this is
what the experiment

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.440
looks like where you've got
a polonium source naturally

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.780
emitting alpha rays.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.590
They hit a foil, a beryllium.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.040
They produce what he did not
know at the time was neutrons.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.350
We actually do know that
beryllium produces neutrons

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.580
pretty well.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.550
Beryllium is an interesting
neutron multiplier.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.700
It undergoes what's called
an n 2n reaction where

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.900
one neutron comes in, two
neutrons can come out,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.840
and it transmutes
into something else.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.840
And we'll go over what
this notation means, what

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.130
these nuclear reactions mean.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.350
If you don't understand
it, don't worry.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.080
The whole point of today
is to open up questions

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.140
that we'll spend the rest of the
semester closing and answering.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.723
So again, if you're
lost, don't worry.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.890
It's the first day of class,
and it's your first day

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:14.710
of Modern Physics.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.080
So not to worry.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.930
And this is an actual
picture of what

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.360
it looked like in the
paper, a simple polonium

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.200
source on a disk that was made
by the natural decomposition

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.820
of radium into polonium, a piece
of beryllium, a vacuum chamber.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.430
Because it was already known
that the alpha particles

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.190
coming from polonium have
an extremely short range.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.550
We're going to figure out
why as part of this class.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.213
But without that vacuum
there, the alpha particles

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:42.630
wouldn't make it
to the beryllium.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.830
So that much was known.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.480
What wasn't known was why are
we getting so many ionizations.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.790
They attributed it to
what they called a process

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.110
similar to the Compton effect.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.910
To tell you what
that is, in 1923,

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.790
Arthur Compton figured
out, among other things,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.020
Compton scattering, where a
photon can strike an electron.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.970
The photon changes energy.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.070
The electron picks
up some energy.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.170
They exit at very
well-known angles,

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.510
and they transfer very
well-known amounts of energy.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.730
So this is how they knew how
much energy the photon, if it

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.400
were to exist, should have.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.740
And they said the process
was analogous to Compton

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.710
scattering because
they said in this case,

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.940
a proton would be ejected.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.140
It would take a lot of energy to
eject a proton using a photon.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.309
And Chadwick saw
this and said, well,

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.480
if we ascribe this phenomenon
to a Compton recoil,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.909
we should see about 10,000 ions.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.820
We actually saw about 30,000.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.530
So there was more
ionization going

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.020
on than can be explained
by what's going on.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.510
In addition, those
protons should

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.330
have a range in air of
about 1.3 millimeters,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.320
and they saw much more.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.720
So this is something simple--

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.300
theory and experiment
don't match.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.030
There's got to be a different
theoretical explanation

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.580
if the experiment was correct.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.650
And so finally, what I love--
the last sentence in this--

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.920
the quantum
hypothesis-- a quantum

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.140
was the way they
referred to a photon.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.700
It was called a
quantum back then,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.140
a little packet of energy.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.710
Can only be upheld if we
forget about conservation

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.480
of energy and momentum.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.830
Now, I'll ask you guys
from 8.01 to 8.02.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.150
So Sean, when can you throw
out energy and momentum

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.175
conservation?

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:30.948
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:30.948 --> 00:09:32.490
MIKE SHORT: That's
pretty much right.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.630
You can't.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.450
A situation probably
wasn't given to you

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.200
where you can just
throw away conservation

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.700
of momentum and energy.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.093
In fact, nature gives
us three quantities

00:09:41.093 --> 00:09:42.510
that we can measure
and conserve--

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.930
mass, momentum, and energy.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.180
And throughout this course,
if something is not conserved,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.400
you've probably got the
math or the physics wrong.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.650
So this is something to
remember throughout the course

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.020
and our derivations and
in your problem sets,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.310
is conserve mass, conserve
momentum, conserve energy, just

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.930
like what was taught
in 8.01 and 8.02.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.530
So I'll call your
answer correct.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.790
You don't remember a situation
because, well, it didn't exist.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.710
And that's what Chadwick noted.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.420
He said theory and
experiment don't

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.700
work unless we throw
out conservation

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.350
of energy and momentum.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.930
Whether this was a kind of
passive-aggressive thing

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.790
to say-- well,
this clearly can't

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.088
exist-- or he was suggesting
maybe it doesn't work,

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:21.630
I don't know.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.100
I wasn't there.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.690
But later on,
about a year later,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.140
he published a follow-on
paper confirming the existence

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.450
of a neutron by reconciling
these differences

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.280
in theory and experiment.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.020
So he restated
what he saw before.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.320
This was the first
paragraph of it.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.920
And again, it said that
radiation excited in beryllium.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.260
Whatever happened after the
alpha particle came out.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.070
It had a highly penetrating
radiation, distinctly greater

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.727
than that of any
gamma radiation found

00:10:48.727 --> 00:10:49.810
from radioactive elements.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.500
Something is different.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.580
And I want us to take
a sec to digest this.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.770
This is the part I actually
want you guys to read,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.680
so take a minute and read
through some of this stuff.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.080
And then we'll begin
explaining his argument.

00:11:26.628 --> 00:11:28.420
Let me know when you
guys are done reading.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.160
OK.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.660
I see some folks
starting to look down.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.260
So let's take this
apart and figure out

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.940
what was Chadwick saying.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.360
He was saying that if a
quantum was responsible

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.610
for this energy,
a photon, then we

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.130
can write a nuclear reaction.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.120
I'll write it in the
notation that we use now,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.660
which would be beryllium-9,
the only naturally occurring

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.290
isotope of beryllium,
plus an alpha particle

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:09.840
would lead to carbon-13
plus a gamma ray.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.060
And that gamma ray
would take away

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.100
the energy from this reaction.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.400
So now we can start to figure
out, is energy conserved?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.360
Could this gamma
ray actually exist?

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.050
And if it does, does it
account for the ionizations

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.640
that Chadwick saw?

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.280
So for each of
these isotopes, we

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.170
know a few different quantities.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:36.570
We know what's called its rest
mass energy, which is this.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.920
It's rest mass times
speed of light squared.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.960
This should look
familiar to everyone.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.630
I've seen it on t-shirts
all over campus.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.400
And it may take
two or three weeks

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.840
to really wrap your head around
what Einstein's equation really

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.770
means.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.050
It is that mass and
energy are equivalent.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.810
You can express mass in terms
of energy, and vise versa.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.760
And you will be doing so
to conserve energy and mass

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.940
in nuclear reactions, one of
which is written right here.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.210
So if each of these things
has a given rest mass energy,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.120
let's say a rest mass
energy of beryllium

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.360
and a rest mass energy
of an alpha particle,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.570
and this alpha particle maybe
had some kinetic energy--

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.100
it was moving pretty
fast, so we'll

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.502
give that the symbol
t for kinetic energy,

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.710
because that's what you're
going to see in your notes

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.600
and in the reading
and everywhere.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.520
And then this
carbon-13 nucleus has

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.850
got to have a rest mass
and a kinetic energy,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.560
and then this gamma
ray, it's going

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.870
to have some e gamma energy.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.770
Now, the question is,
is the mass and energy

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.558
conserved in this equation?

00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:44.100
What we're actually
starting to write

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.000
is what's called the q
equation, or the universal mass

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.540
and energy balance for any
kind of nuclear reaction.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.440
So let's say we have a
large initial nucleus

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.520
i and some small
particle i moving

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.460
at it with some great speed.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.580
And after some
reaction occurs, you

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.720
have a small, final
particle leaving

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.240
and a different, large
final particle leaving.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.160
They don't necessarily
have to be the same.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:22.410
Let's give these particles
designations 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.780
In the end, we should be
able to write the difference

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.060
in either total
energy or total mass

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.840
of the system as this value q.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.200
q is, let's say,
the amount of energy

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.242
that turns into
mass, or vise versa.

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:37.450
So let's say energy transfer.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.420
And so if we start writing some
mass conservation equation,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.840
we can say that the
mass of nucleus 1

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.540
plus the mass of
nucleus 2 should

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.250
equal the mass of nucleus 3
plus the mass of nucleus 4

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.680
plus however much energy
from nuclei 1 and 2 turned

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.853
into energy into 3 and 4.

00:15:04.853 --> 00:15:06.270
We could also write
the same thing

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.130
for their kinetic energies.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.468
In this case, the
finals are on the end.

00:15:12.468 --> 00:15:13.010
So I'm sorry.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.910
I should use t for
kinetic energy.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.350
So what this is saying is
that if some mass has turned

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.450
into energy at the
end, that energy

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.370
had to come from somewhere.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.220
It had to come from the initial
kinetic energy or conversion

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.993
of mass to energy
from this reaction.

00:15:38.993 --> 00:15:40.660
And so notice that
now, you can actually

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.380
express the masses of the
nuclei in terms of their energy,

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.875
of their initial and
final kinetic energies.

00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:48.250
And this right
here is what we're

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.640
going to be spending the first
two or three weeks deriving,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.030
using, and exploring in order
to balance nuclear reactions

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.400
and explain why they
are the way they are.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.200
So let's make sure-- we'll keep
this nuclear reaction up here,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.960
because Chadwick proposed
a different one to explain

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.190
what he saw.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.320
And some of the
evidence for this

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.710
was that he put
some aluminum foil

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:20.520
in between the beryllium where
things were being liberated

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.710
and the ionization
chamber and oscilloscope,

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.070
or oscillograph, as
he liked to call it.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.090
And that way, by putting
more and more pieces of foil

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.680
in there, you can
deduce what's called

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:37.230
the range, or the distance
that the radiation will travel

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.373
before it stops by losing
energy through a whole host

00:16:40.373 --> 00:16:42.540
of different processes that
we'll be working through

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.620
together.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.200
If this were to be
ascribed to a proton,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.640
then it should have had
a certain range in air

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.740
by this curve b right here.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.680
Instead, he found this curve a
where things moved about three

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.120
times farther than
could have been

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.330
explained if that
were a proton to be

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.100
liberated by all this stuff.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.670
So he's saying, OK, something
has got more penetrating power.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.829
We know now that part
of the reason for this

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:12.577
is if there's a neutron,
and there's no charge on it,

00:17:12.577 --> 00:17:15.119
then it's not going to interact
with the electrons in matter.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.680
It won't even see them.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.359
Whereas protons or
any other charged

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.910
particles will see the
electrons in matter

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.950
and will interact with the
electrons and the nuclei.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.950
So a little flash
forward to say,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.720
we can explain this pretty
simply with what we generally

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.220
know.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.080
But this was the
first time somebody

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.213
had to come up with
[INAUDIBLE] explanation,

00:17:33.213 --> 00:17:34.130
and it was quite hard.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.220
And so moving on,
he can say, well, I

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.820
know what protons should
be injected from paraffin.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.410
I know a formula to describe
what quantum or photon

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.990
energy had to create them.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.960
And then instead, he says-- this
is where his major hypothesis

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.650
is--

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.630
either we relinquish
conservation

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.910
of energy or neutron or
adopt another hypothesis.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:05.170
And this was already put
forth by Rutherford back

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.940
in the '20s that there
may be a neutron,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.620
but there wasn't any proof.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.260
And this is what
provided the proof.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.530
He gave an alternate
nuclear reaction

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.540
if there were to be
a neutron which had

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.830
roughly the mass of a proton.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.620
Then let's write a
second one down here.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.320
I'm going to erase
these extra notation,

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.740
and we'll write the competing
nuclear action below.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:34.960
And he said that-- let's say
we start with beryllium-9

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.050
plus an alpha
particle could instead

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.840
become carbon-12 and a neutron.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.080
So I'd like to ask you guys
right now to work this out.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.560
Are both of these reactions
balanced in terms of mass?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.810
Are there the same number
of protons, neutrons,

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.930
and electrons at either side?

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.390
And just to let you
know, an alpha particle

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.080
is better known as
a helium nucleus.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.170
So that means that
there's two protons.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.410
There's four protons
plus neutrons,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:22.730
and beryllium-9 has four protons
and nine protons plus neutrons.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.650
And carbon-12 has six protons.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.015
A neutron has zero protons.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.780
So in each of these-- and I'll
fill in the other ones here.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.690
So that's a 4, 4, 2, and 6.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.820
Do we have the same number
of protons and neutrons

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.680
on both sides of both equations?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.930
I see a number of heads and
one person saying yes, we do.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.200
So both of these reactions
are balanced in terms of mass.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.410
The next thing to do is balance
them in terms of energy.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.080
Now, they can both be
balanced in terms of energy

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.700
because you could attribute the
change in the amount of mass

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.280
from here to there
and attribute that

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.650
to the energy of the photon.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:16.040
That's when you'd have to have a
photon of energy around 50 MeV.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.240
But if a proton--

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.700
I'm sorry-- a photon
of energy around 50 MeV

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.430
can't explain what we saw.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.440
Instead, if there is something
like a neutron which also

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:31.300
has its own rest mass and
its own kinetic energy,

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.550
and that neutron were
highly penetrating,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.030
it could explain
what Chadwick saw.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.030
And so the masses and
things of these nuclei

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.030
were fairly well known
back then to, well,

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.000
six significant digits
based on some very careful

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.290
experimentation.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.730
And all he did is
say, all right.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.610
Let's take all of the
energies in this reaction.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.040
Remember how I
told you over here,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.690
you can write any
nuclear reaction

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.730
in terms of its
kinetic energies,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.990
and the difference will
give you the q value,

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.610
which you can attribute to the
conversion of mass to energy?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.740
That's what Chadwick
did right here.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.560
He took the full
reaction, saying here's

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.520
the mass of beryllium, the
mass of the alpha particle,

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.035
the kinetic energy of
the alpha particle.

00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:17.410
Note that he assumed that the
kinetic energy of beryllium

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:17.950
was zero.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.290
It was just sitting
at room temperature.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.870
Does anyone know the approximate
kinetic energy of atoms

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.880
at room temperature?

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.440
Order of magnitude, even?

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.330
It's around 1/100 to 1/1,000
of an EV, or an electron volt.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.730
So when we're talking
about beryllium,

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.470
whose kinetic energy, we'll
say, is around 0.01 EV,

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.400
and the alpha particle whose
kinetic energy was around 4

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.920
times 10 to the 6th EV, you
can see why it's neglected.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.120
And you can do that too.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:57.090
You do not have to account
for the initial kinetic energy

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.070
of a nucleus at rest.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.930
This is the first
approximation that we

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.522
tend to make to the q equation
to just have fewer variables.

00:22:04.522 --> 00:22:06.480
And don't worry if you
don't remember this now,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.930
because we have a whole
lecture on the q equation.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.720
And so finally, he
said, all right.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.350
We'll subtract all the masses.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.260
We're left with the kinetic
energies and a little bit

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.200
of excess rest mass.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.830
That's got to be--

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.970
this has got to exist.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.890
And so this inequality has to be
satisfied, which indeed it was.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.530
Using this inequality,
he said that the velocity

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.920
of the neutron has to be
less than its kinetic energy

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.860
if it had all of that
energy, 3.9 times 10

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.630
to the 9 centimeter per second.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.190
Indeed it was lower--

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.460
not by that much, but it still
satisfied this criterion.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.290
So things are checking out.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.210
That's pretty cool.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.400
He looked at another
nuclear reaction

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.870
that was known at the time.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.110
If you were to bombard
boron-11 with helium,

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.950
you end up with
nitrogen-14 and either--

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.620
either end up with
nitrogen-15 and a photon

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.710
or nitrogen-14 and a
neutron, explaining

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.380
another reaction that
wasn't as well known before.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.737
So I'd like to write
this nuclear reaction,

00:23:10.737 --> 00:23:13.070
because I want you all to get
very familiar with writing

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.880
nuclear reactions.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.910
Let's say boron-11 plus
an alpha particle--

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.610
we'll say it has a mass of 4--

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:26.540
becomes nitrogen
14 and a neutron.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.460
We also have a
shorthand of writing

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.050
this nuclear reaction
which I'll use

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.180
on the board for speed's sake.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.740
Usually if you put
the initial nucleus

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.980
and the initial incoming
radiation, comma,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.810
the exiting radiation,
and the final nucleus,

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.140
these two right
here are equivalent.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.780
This is just a shorthand
for nuclear reactions.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.000
This is what you'll
tend to see because it's

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.240
a lot easier to write this
shorthand and parse it visually

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.680
than it is to parse a
whole nuclear reaction.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.180
So I just want you to know if
you don't know what these are,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.670
just remember to
stick the arrow here,

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.530
stick plus signs in
for the parentheses,

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.300
and you've got the same thing.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.120
And using these, you should be
able to very quickly determine

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.350
is this reaction balanced.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.940
What's actually going on?

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.240
And there will be tabulated
values of q values or energy

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.228
amounts for these
sorts of reactions

00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:24.020
in all sorts of tables
I'll be showing you.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.170
And so finally, he
figured out what

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.830
the energy or the mass defect
of the neutrons should be.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.630
Does anyone know what
a mass defect is?

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.460
This is another core concept.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.210
Let's say you were to want
to make an atom of helium.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.220
So you would have to take
two protons whose masses are

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.920
very well known,
and two neutrons,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920
and bring them together.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.340
So if you were to
have-- let's say

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.900
the initial mass
would be 2 times

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:10.930
the mass of a neutron plus 2
times the mass of a proton.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:16.290
And the final mass is just
the mass of a helium nucleus.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.630
You'll actually find that
the initial mass does not

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.080
equal the final mass.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.555
In bringing nuclei
or nucleons together,

00:25:25.555 --> 00:25:27.930
they actually release what's
called their binding energy.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.330
It's what keeps the
nucleus bound together.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.880
There's a little bit of
mass turned into energy.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.030
And so you know how we like
say the whole is usually

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.355
more than the sum of its parts?

00:25:37.355 --> 00:25:38.730
In nuclear
engineering, the whole

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.740
is a little less than
the sum of its parts.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.930
It definitely is not equal.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.740
And Chadwick was proposing
that a neutron should actually

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.700
be made up of a
proton and an electron

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.535
in very close proximity.

00:25:55.535 --> 00:25:57.660
And since the masses of
the proton and the electron

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.330
were known, he said, well,
if we bring the proton

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.090
and electron very
close together to have

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.900
an overall neutral
neutron particle,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.220
it should have roughly that
mass defect or that difference

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.850
between the energy of
its constituent nucleons

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.550
and the energy of the
assembled nucleus.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.520
And you'll hear the
words "mass defect"

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.050
and "binding energy" used.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.740
Mass defect is in terms
of mass in either--

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.740
you can give it in kilograms
or in atomic mass units,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:40.952
or AMU, or in, let's
say, MeV c squared.

00:26:40.952 --> 00:26:43.160
And you'll also hear of the
binding energy just given

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.210
in things like MeV.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.910
I want to show you where you
can find these things now.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.140
I'll give you the single
most useful website

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.260
that you'll be referring to.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.730
And I've posted it up on
the Learning Module site,

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.840
so now is a good time for me to
show you that the site exists.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.690
And let me just clone
my screen real quick.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.368
It's a wireless HDMI thing, so
it takes a sec to pop back up.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.410
Great.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.620
Has anyone not been
to the site yet?

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.120
It's OK.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.110
You don't have to
be embarrassed.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.610
OK.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.790
About half of you.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:25.120
I recommend tonight that you
start looking through the site.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.190
One, make sure that
you can log in,

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.160
because you'll need to log in
to see some of the copyrighted

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.740
materials that I've posted,
and two, because this is where

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.810
you'll be posting
all your homeworks,

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.120
getting the assignments,
checking due dates.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.940
Especially if I
postpone a problem set,

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.160
I'll put out an announcement
and post it here.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.070
So this is the place
to look for everything.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.620
And in addition, I've posted
a lot of useful materials

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.240
for you guys.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.990
They're all at the
bottom, and the top one

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.890
is the [INAUDIBLE]
table of nuclides.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.050
Anyone seen this
kind of thing before?

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.690
We have posters of it down on
all the first-floor classrooms

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.160
in Building 24.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.600
This is our go-to chart.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.480
When you want to find out
all of the nuclear half-life,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.150
radioactive decay
and decay of energy,

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.700
probability of certain
direction, whatever,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.570
this is where you go.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.443
So let's take a look
at, well, helium-4

00:28:16.443 --> 00:28:17.860
since we've been
talking about it,

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.690
better known as
an alpha particle.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.080
And you'll notice a few
different quantities visible.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:29.770
The atomic mass, 4.0026032 AMU.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.290
And this is another tip I want
to give you guys right now.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.750
Don't round these numbers.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.730
That's one of the
major trip up points.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.390
If you say that's
approximately 4 or 4.003,

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.150
you probably won't get
the p-set questions right,

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:47.500
because 1/1,000 of an AMU can
still represent almost an MeV

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.970
of lost energy.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.250
So let's say you have
a nuclear reaction that

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.750
liberates a 1 mega electron
volt or one MeV gamma ray,

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.910
and you get the
fourth digit wrong

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.410
in one of your
mass calculations.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.330
It's like that gamma
ray didn't exist,

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.070
and you won't get
the answer right.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.430
So again, word to the
wise-- do not round.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.730
You'll also see what's known as
the excess mass or the binding

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.240
energy.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.820
So this binding
energy right here,

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.300
if you were to take two
protons and two neutrons

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.140
and bring them together and
look at the difference in masses

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.140
from, let's say, the same
old formula as before,

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:33.880
you would get a difference of
28,295 keV, or about 28.295673

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.810
MeV.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.585
Again, don't round.

00:29:36.585 --> 00:29:37.960
Let's figure this
out right here.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:46.540
So we have 28.295673 MeV.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.570
And there is a conversion factor
that you should either memorize

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.440
or write down.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.970
Either way, it's good.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:59.470
It's about 931.49 MeV
per atomic mass unit.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.140
This is your mass
energy equivalence

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.360
that you'll be using over
and over and over again.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.070
And again, don't round.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.550
Those last two
digits are important.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.460
So by taking this energy and
dividing by this conversion

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.180
factor, you can figure out
how many atomic mass units are

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.670
lost in terms of
actual mass when

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.900
you assemble an alpha particle
from its constituent pieces.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.202
And the rest of the stuff
we will get into later.

00:30:26.202 --> 00:30:28.160
It's not really relevant
to today's discussion,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.660
but it's definitely
relevant to today's course.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.620
Cool.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.190
OK.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.793
And then on to--

00:30:37.793 --> 00:30:39.460
one of the last things
that he mentioned

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.670
is some predictions to say, OK,
let's say this neutron exists.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.340
It doesn't have charge.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.070
Most matter interacts
with other matter

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.920
by virtue of Coulombic
or charge interactions.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.110
If the neutron has no
charge, it shouldn't really

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.790
see matter except for nuclei.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.020
This is exactly what he
said, is an electrical field

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.760
of a neutron will be
extremely small except

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.290
at small distances, because
he proposed that a neutron is

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.120
a proton plus an electron.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.700
So once you get to around
the radius of the neutron,

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.180
you might start to see some
charge, but not before.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.800
And so most other
matter, unless you

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.170
have a head-on collision with a
nucleus, neutrons won't see it.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.180
And that helps explain
why the neutrons

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.970
had such high penetrating
power or high range--

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.970
because they just went streaming
through most materials,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.920
invisible to the electrons.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.770
So very forward thinking, and
turned out to be very correct.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.330
And then finally, as a kind
of mic drop conclusion,

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:42.460
came up with the final
concluding statements.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.500
OK, we know there's a neutron.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.090
We know its mass.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:52.930
The actual mass of the
neutron is about 1.0087 AMU so

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:57.760
within 0.1% of Chadwick's
calculations and predictions

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.410
based on 1930s equipment,
which is strikingly awesome.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.130
And there you have it.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.318
That's the discovery
of the neutron using

00:32:06.318 --> 00:32:08.860
most of the concepts that we're
going to be teaching you here

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.360
in 22.01.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.550
So right now, I'd say
your scientific knowledge,

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.410
if we don't count what
you read on the news,

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.930
is roughly around
1850 when all the E&M

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.420
stuff was being figured out.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.280
We are going to bring you
screaming into the 1930s.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.670
And by about month 1,
we'll hit the present day

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.100
when we can start to talk
about the super heavy elements

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.650
like the ones that were
discovered last year.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.403
I think there was
even some this year.

00:32:31.403 --> 00:32:33.820
But we'll look at the Physics
Today article from last year

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.920
to get to the
point of explaining

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.200
why super heavy elements
might be stable.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.940
Why are we even
looking for them?

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.645
Where do cosmic rays come from?

00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:44.020
How do we know that they're
cosmic rays and not something

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.650
else?

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.170
How can you tell a reactor
turns on anywhere in the world

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.810
by measuring different
bits of radiation, which

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.090
is an active defense
project that folks

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.530
are pursuing right now?

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.960
Lots of really fun questions.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.150
And speaking of
questions, do you guys

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.850
have any questions about
what we've explained here,

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.670
how we've retraced Chadwick's
discovery of the neutron

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.650
from basic nuclear
science principles?

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:12.820
So who here has seen these
nuclear reactions before?

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.320
Cool.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.778
This is something
that I hope folks

00:33:14.778 --> 00:33:15.990
would cover in high school.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.785
But with a general
trend of watering down

00:33:17.785 --> 00:33:20.160
science education, I didn't
want to make any assumptions.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.740
I'm glad to hear
this was covered.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.510
Was this coveted at MIT?

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.960
Are you guys relying on
high school knowledge?

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.550
OK, good.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.917
Not good.

00:33:31.917 --> 00:33:33.000
Good I know where you are.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.010
Not good that MIT doesn't
teach anything nuclear

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.180
until year two.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.320
That's OK.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.310
You guys, along with
the Physics Department,

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:43.290
will get at least a 20th-century
knowledge of physics and 21st

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.780
by the end of month 1.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:50.250
So I want to come back
to the Stellar site,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.720
and specifically the syllabus.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.050
I've taken a lot of care to
write a very detailed syllabus

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.490
of what we're going to do,
what I expect of you guys, what

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.530
you can expect of
me, and what we'll

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.950
be doing every single day.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.590
So if you want to
know what we're

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.780
going to be doing, if you have
a class that you miss, and you

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.655
want to know what notes
you're going to miss,

00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:10.530
it's all written up here.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.440
I want to get right
into assignments,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.989
because everyone wants to know
what am I responsible for.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.699
Well, not too much--

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.580
nine problems sets,
three quizzes.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.860
The final exam is just a quiz.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.518
It's only worth 24% of
your grade instead of 20

00:34:26.518 --> 00:34:28.560
to get the math to work
out, because I eliminated

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.550
one problem set to avoid running
afoul of MIT regulations,

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.190
but not assigning things
at the last week of class.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.800
But there are three quizzes,
so the final exam is just

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.909
another quiz.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:41.130
It's not a super
high-stress, crazy thing,

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.889
because I don't see a
point in doing that.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.440
You can make your
assignments however you want.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.440
I don't care as long
as I can read them.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.989
But I do ask that in the
end, you submit a PDF

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.570
file on the Stellar site.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.320
And the reason for
this is my first course

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.900
that I ever taught at
MIT as a professor were

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.770
the graduate modules, 22.13,
Intro to Nuclear Systems,

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:05.040
and 22.14, Intro to
Nuclear Materials.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.200
I accepted paper submissions.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.020
And by week 3, I had
to microwave them.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.320
Because three or four times,
I definitely saw blood.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.630
And there were also
some weird stains

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:16.950
that I didn't want to explain.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.520
So I added the habit of
unstapling, microwaving,

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.130
and re-stapling the
p-sets before grading.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.860
So in the digital
world, it's sterile.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.970
I'm not a germophobe.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.200
I just don't like
blood in my house,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.750
especially if it's not mine.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.860
So I ask that you guys submit
PDFs on the Stellar site.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.860
They're due at 5:00 PM to
make sure that you're done

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.108
and you can go home and relax
or work on something else.

00:35:41.108 --> 00:35:42.900
I used to some have
things due at midnight,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.020
and I had every
submission was 11:59 PM.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.490
I'm not going to
do that anymore.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.450
Do make sure to submit
15 minutes early.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.140
So if your computer or the
Stellar site has trouble,

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.638
send me an email or a
text or whatever saying,

00:35:54.638 --> 00:35:56.430
I'm trying to submit,
and it's not working.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.850
Here is a backup, or I'm leaving
something under your door.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.440
And if you want my
cell phone number,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.650
that's also my office number.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.990
It's also my only number.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.792
It's in the MIT directory.

00:36:05.792 --> 00:36:08.250
So if there is some emergency
you need to make me aware of,

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.360
please do communicate.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.270
I'd rather you tell me than be
worried about not telling me

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.743
and then find out later.

00:36:13.743 --> 00:36:14.910
So are we all clear on that?

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.350
As far as what the
assignments are,

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.380
each assignment is going to be
about 50% basic calculations,

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.320
working out things like these
to make sure you've mastered

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.030
the material, that
you understand

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.330
writing nuclear reactions,
you can balance a q equation,

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.010
you can tell me about
what your cancer

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.977
risk would be from a
certain dose of material.

00:36:34.977 --> 00:36:37.060
So this is like when you
go out in the real world,

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.470
the sort of
calculations everyone

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:42.320
would expect you as a nuclear
engineer to be able to do.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.350
And then 50% of each
problem set is either

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.250
going to be analytical questions
of considerable difficulty.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.540
This is MIT.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.000
We're not just here
to give you the basics

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.620
so that you can
regurgitate a textbook

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.520
onto the first person who asks.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.520
We're here to make sure
that you can go farther.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.680
Because you guys are
the future of this very

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.950
small and diminishing field
at the moment if you look

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.960
at the nuclear power in the US.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.190
I would say growing
in terms of the world,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.315
but not in terms of the US.

00:37:08.315 --> 00:37:10.815
And you guys are going to be
in charge of leading this field

00:37:10.815 --> 00:37:12.468
and determining where
it's going to go.

00:37:12.468 --> 00:37:14.260
So you've got to be up
at the cutting edge,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.500
and we're going to take you
to the edge of your abilities.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.480
My favorite kind of
problem is to give

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.560
one sentence for the question,
five or 10 pages for the answer

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.210
if you don't get the trick.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.340
Now, that's OK.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.083
It's perfectly fine
not to figure out

00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:31.000
the answer in the end.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.640
In fact, I'll usually
give you the answer

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.590
for the analytical
questions because I

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.330
want to see your approach.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.640
I'm not interested in
you nailing the answer.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.830
I'm interested in
seeing how you think.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:45.190
And copious partial credit will
be given for the way you think.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.562
So if you have a missing
step, and you say,

00:37:47.562 --> 00:37:49.770
I don't know the step, I'm
going to assume variable a

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.610
and keep going,
you will get credit

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.550
for the subsequent steps.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.230
I want to see how you
think from start to finish

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:59.610
and how you cover for holes
that you can't get through.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.050
So everyone clear on that?

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.090
Partial credit, yes.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.260
Use it to your fullest ability.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.850
The other half of
the problem sets

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.780
will have take-home
laboratory assignments.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.590
It's not just enough
for me to tell you

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.120
about nuclear engineering.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.220
You have to see it
for yourself, and you

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.910
have to feel it for yourself.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.330
And once in a while, you'll
get a mild electric shock

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.030
by yourself if things
go wrong, but that's OK.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.160
It happens to the best of us.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.113
I got zapped by our--

00:38:26.113 --> 00:38:28.030
you guys have all made
Geiger counters, right?

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.700
Has anyone not made
a Geiger counter yet?

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.480
Oh, OK.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.890
It sounds like we need
to run another workshop.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:37.750
Well, our Geiger counters
rely on a neat little boost

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.300
converter power supply
that takes 9 volts

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.380
and steps it up to 400 volts
via some switching things.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.658
That means you have 400
volts on a big metal tube.

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:48.200
And if you're working
on your circuit

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.250
and you happen to brush against
it, you get zero current,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:56.020
so it doesn't hurt you in the
medical sense, but it hurts.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.930
I also have a dance I
call the 60 Hertz shuffle.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.300
It's the high speed
shaking that you

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.398
do when you're
connected to 60 Hertz

00:39:03.398 --> 00:39:04.690
somewhere from the wall outlet.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.398
None of you guys will
be exposed to this,

00:39:06.398 --> 00:39:08.200
but I've done it
enough times that I

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.300
have a name for the dance.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.640
If you get 400 volts,
you'll just kind of scream.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.730
And I don't care how
manly men you guys are.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.480
Everyone makes the same
pitch scream with 400 volts.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.010
We're all equal in the
eyes of electricity.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.780
For these laboratory
questions, I'm

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.180
going to ask you to both
complete an assignment where

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.720
you'll, for example, measure
the half-life of uranium,

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.930
measure the radioactivity
of one banana, confirm

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.060
or refute the
linear no threshold

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.860
hypothesis of the dose.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.170
And the experiment itself
won't take that long,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:46.000
but I want you to write it up in
proper documented format using

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.760
these sections.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.427
So I'm going to be
teaching you guys how

00:39:48.427 --> 00:39:50.940
to write scientific articles.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.890
So actually, this is kind of
a good time to ask you guys.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.910
How would you define
the word "science?"

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.910
Luke, what do you think?

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.410
AUDIENCE: It's a process
of getting knowledge

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.568
by fitting theories
to empirical evidence.

00:40:08.568 --> 00:40:10.610
MIKE SHORT: Gaining
knowledge by fitting theories

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.550
to empirical evidence.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.050
OK.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.660
So I hear knowledge
gaining by some sort

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.090
of well-justified and
accepted means, right?

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.110
Monica, what do you think?

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.960
AUDIENCE: Science is the
study of the natural world

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.450
through patterns and
mathematics, I suppose.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.440
MIKE SHORT: Cool, yeah.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.482
Let's say the studying,
modeling, and abstraction

00:40:33.482 --> 00:40:37.230
of the natural world into
ways we can understand.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.182
Jared, what would you say?

00:40:40.182 --> 00:40:41.015
AUDIENCE: Which one?

00:40:41.015 --> 00:40:43.470
MIKE SHORT: Oh,
there's two Jareds.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.200
I want to hear both,
and then I'll--

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.970
yeah.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:49.725
AUDIENCE: Science is--

00:40:53.306 --> 00:40:55.730
I'd probably go with
it's the same thing

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:00.480
Luke said, gaining knowledge
through experimentation

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.920
and trial.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.800
MIKE SHORT: Cool.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.050
And other Jared?

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:08.230
AUDIENCE: I think what Luke
said about fitting theories

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.750
to empirical evidence and
testing them that way.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.678
MIKE SHORT: OK, cool.

00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:12.220
I like these.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.590
And these are the
generally accepted theories

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.800
and descriptions I've
heard of science.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.940
And I want to pose a
question to you guys.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.700
If a tree falls in the woods
and nobody is around to hear it,

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.880
can it win the Nobel Prize?

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.120
It's kind of an expression.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.010
So if somebody
discovered the neutron,

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.480
and they wrote up
their findings,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.270
and proved that it exists,
and they put it in their desk,

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.700
and the house burned
down, and the person died,

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.710
was the neutron discovered?

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.080
What does discovered mean?

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.570
So to me, science is
equal parts everything you

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.620
guys said and communication.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.040
If you discover something
and you don't tell anyone,

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.870
the information
technically doesn't exist.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.010
It dies with you.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.503
And you don't want
that to happen.

00:42:06.503 --> 00:42:08.670
So I want to make sure that
you guys both understand

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:13.050
the science and understand the
importance of communicating it

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:13.980
effectively to people.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.522
Because that's the
other thing you're

00:42:15.522 --> 00:42:17.670
going to be doing as
leaders in this field

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.360
is explaining things.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.110
You better believe when
Fukushima happened--

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.460
I was a postdoc at the time.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.630
I was not a person, I guess,
in the academic sense.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.190
People here treated
me very well,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.100
but I was also very aware that
I was not one of the greats.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.470
Still I am not old enough yet.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.260
I was getting calls all
day, all night from news

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.060
agencies saying, you're at MIT.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.680
I saw your name
on the directory.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.330
Do a radio interview and tell
us all if we're going to die.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.740
And you can only imagine what
the professors on this hall

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.370
were dealing with.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.370
So folks were traveling
around, answering things

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.280
left and right.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.770
I ended up doing some weird
podcast on a Brazilian news

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.600
channel that I don't
think ever got aired

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.320
and stopped doing it after that.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.950
You as undergrads even
might be called if somebody

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:00.630
wants to know something.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.060
And so it's best that you
not only know the material,

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.430
but you can convey
it effectively,

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.210
briefly, and in a way that
your audience can understand.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.450
The audience for these
articles is any undergraduate

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.550
in any engineering
program anywhere.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.872
That's your lowest
common denominator--

00:43:16.872 --> 00:43:18.330
not to say that
that's a bad thing,

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:21.810
but it is the audience that you
want to aim your writing at.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.640
So what I want you
to be able to do

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.170
is say what you did, why you
did it, and what it means.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:32.040
In communication terms, this
means a less-than-100-word

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.300
abstract, a very brief synopsis
of what you did and why

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.380
it's important.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.190
That's the teaser.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.680
This is the trailer to make
somebody read what you actually

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.270
did and see why they care.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.040
This is the main
method and currency

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.540
through which
scientists communicate

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.860
is articles of this type.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.160
An introduction and
background which

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.450
says why are we
studying this problem.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.420
And the answer is not
because I told you to,

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.230
and your grade depends on it.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.040
I want you to think about why
this problem is important,

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.680
and put it into
context, and give

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.900
any of the scientific
background to understand

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.530
what's going to come next,
like the experimental section.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.260
Describe what you did in nitty
gritty scientific detail.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.970
This is usually the easy part.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:16.560
I put this gamma ray in this
bucket, and it made this color,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.180
and I made this noise, whatever.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.800
A results section
where you show all

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.480
of your data and a
discussion section--

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.040
notice that these are different.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.310
You want to separate
your actual results

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.500
from your interpretation
of your results,

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.670
because someone else may have
a very different interpretation

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.780
of results--

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.790
for example, Chadwick.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.930
Somebody found that
beryllium bombarded

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.820
by alpha particles
emitted radiation

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.050
of great penetrating power.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.680
That's the result. The
interpretation or discussion

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.710
said it's probably a
Compton-like effect

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:54.760
from a photon.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.490
By separating your results
and your discussion,

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.280
you allow people to mentally
say, OK, I get your results.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.290
I believe that you
found these numbers.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.918
I have a different explanation.

00:45:03.918 --> 00:45:05.710
And you all may have
different explanations

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.540
for what you see
in your own labs,

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.490
because you're also probably
going to get different results.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:13.330
And then finally, a conclusion
where you quickly re-summarize

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:14.950
your major contributions.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.810
Your abstract is the teaser.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.930
Your conclusion is like your
re-abstract with the context

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.190
that people now believe--

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:24.358
or don't-- what you did.

00:45:24.358 --> 00:45:26.150
And think about how
you guys read articles.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:30.140
So who here has read
scientific articles before?

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.880
More than half of you.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.930
Let's see.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.945
Alex, what do you read first?

00:45:35.945 --> 00:45:38.750
AUDIENCE: If it's a journal,
probably the abstract.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.940
But given that I'm mostly
interested in the topic,

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.678
I tend to go to the
conclusion section.

00:45:43.678 --> 00:45:44.720
MIKE SHORT: That's right.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.200
OK.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.010
I'm glad you said that.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.180
That was my next question.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.590
You read the abstract.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.660
The next thing you
read is the conclusion.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.160
The next thing you
usually read is

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.110
you skim through the
results and the figures

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.700
and see if it's
worth looking at.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.490
Then if you're like, OK,
this is worth my time,

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:00.920
then you slog through
and read everything

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.870
to make sure you
understand it all.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.640
So when you're writing
these articles,

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.803
think about who's reading
them and how they read them.

00:46:07.803 --> 00:46:10.220
Because if you guys don't tend
to read an article from top

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.290
to bottom, neither
will your audience.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:13.250
And that's true.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.010
Most scientists skim things
because we have a lot to read.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.460
So that's OK.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.750
And I am very interested
in you guys completely

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.130
documenting your experiment.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.040
Pictures are also
awesome to use.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.660
Accuracy of results
and analysis--

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.360
so did you round when
you weren't supposed to?

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.380
Did you have a clear numerical
typo that you can't explain?

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.070
And the readability
of the report--

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.400
I want you to spend time
making this readable.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.260
I expect that this
part of the assignment

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.830
will take roughly five hours,
whereas the basic questions

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.020
will take roughly three
to four hours depending

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.310
on how well you're doing.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.470
And that leaves three
hours of class time

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.380
and a couple hours for
whatever else happens in life,

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.730
let's call it.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.817
Since you've never
written these before--

00:46:55.817 --> 00:46:56.400
wait a minute.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.275
I shouldn't say that.

00:46:57.275 --> 00:46:59.370
Who's written these
kinds of things before?

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.530
Anyone here wrote a
scientific article?

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.030
Two.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.380
OK, three.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.193
Cool.

00:47:04.193 --> 00:47:05.610
So most of you
haven't, and that's

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.470
where I assumed you'd all be.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.470
We have a whole lab dedicated to
scientific communication called

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.900
the Comm Lab run by
someone, who happens

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.820
to be my wife, four doors down.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.580
We live and work
next to each other.

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.840
It's pretty cool.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.970
And you get an automatic
three-day extension

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.760
on the lab assignment if
you go to the Comm Lab.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.420
There are three
reasons for this.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.750
One, I want you to
get better grades,

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.730
so I want you to learn
how to communicate.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.340
Two, I don't want to spend
time trying to figure out

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:33.870
what you were trying to say.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:37.050
So better articles means
less grading time for me.

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:40.410
And three-- OK, let's
just say it's two reasons.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.180
That's enough.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.000
And for everything
except for the quizzes,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.070
it's perfectly OK
to work together

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.860
as long as you
attribute who did what,

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.890
you write your own articles,
don't Xerox anything,

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.360
and say who took the data.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.820
So if the whole class wants
to get together and take one

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.150
set of data and
work for that, fine.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:00.900
If you all want to do
the labs yourselves,

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.090
which I highly recommend, fine.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.100
But I'm not going
to tell you how

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.040
to do the lab assignment
in this, as long as you

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.600
say what you did.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.330
And I want all of you,
if you haven't yet,

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:16.740
to head to integrity.mit.edu
to see our official policies

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.500
on what is considered
plagiarism, what is considered

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.920
working together, what's
considered academic honesty.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.050
I will assume, because
it's on the syllabus

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.750
and I'm telling you now,
that you've all read this,

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.210
and that there will
be no cheating.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.040
It's just not something that's
part of my job description,

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.525
and I don't want
to deal with it,

00:48:33.525 --> 00:48:34.900
which means I
won't deal with it,

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.170
which means the
consequences will be severe.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.700
So I don't think I'll
have to worry about that.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.930
And then for the late
policy, it's just 10%

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.780
of the value of assignment
for each calendar day, not

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.200
each business day.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.620
So if you're running really
late and you haven't started

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.700
an assignment the day it's due,
better to take the 10% penalty

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.430
and do really well than
hand in nothing on time.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:00.160
So keep in mind how
can you maximize

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.930
the points in this course.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.330
I'd rather you hand
in something good late

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.080
than terrible on time.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.180
So if you really need that extra
day if MIT gets crazy, take it.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.030
10% of a problem set is
0.4 points on your grade.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:16.340
It's not that big a deal.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.430
Then as far as the syllabus, I
want to show you very quickly.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.470
We've got when things are due.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.140
I'm going to change these dates
to basically just shift them

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.790
all forward by
one day to account

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.580
for the new Tuesday,
Thursday classes.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.860
So I've got when the
problem sets are due.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.530
And Friday is
recitation activities.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.300
If there aren't
too many questions

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.400
on a particular
Friday, I have a lot

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.020
of fun stuff in store for you.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.690
For example,
tomorrow we're going

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:44.060
to be talking about radiation
utilizing technology, including

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.000
plasma sputter coders, one of
which we have set up in my lab,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.230
and I'd like to show you.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.730
Because it's a way
that you can coat

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.530
materials and other
materials, and you

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.800
have to generate this beautiful,
glowing purple plasma in order

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800
to do so.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.820
So you ionize nitrogen. You
induce sputtering, which

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.400
is a radiation damage process
which we'll be going over,

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.632
to coat things in other things.

00:50:03.632 --> 00:50:05.090
There will be once
in a while where

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.030
I have to shift a class into
recitation because I'll be

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.210
at Westinghouse or in Russia.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.530
And I think that's only
twice during the whole year.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:13.790
So you won't miss any classes.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.770
We'll just use the
recitation time.

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.780
And then other,
times we'll be doing

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.480
measuring the radioactivity
of banana hashes.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.270
Or once we talk about
electron interactions,

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.720
we're going to go use a
scanning electron microscope.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.120
The carrot at the end of
the stick to make sure

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.280
that you guys do well--

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.330
the top two people performing
on the quizzes get to pilot

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.020
and choose the samples for
the SEM and elemental analysis

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.360
and the focused ion
beam demonstration.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.870
So you guys get to pilot
something that's, let's

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.480
say, as complicated as a
space shuttle but deals

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.340
with things much, much smaller.

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.840
So I'll put you in
the driver's seat

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.070
in the machines of
our lab, and you

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.153
get to bring whatever you
want to analyze and find

00:50:54.153 --> 00:50:57.325
the elemental analysis of
and use the world's smallest

00:50:57.325 --> 00:50:58.700
machining instrument
that can cut

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.940
5-nanometer slices of things
using processes that we're

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.508
going to discuss in this class.

00:51:03.508 --> 00:51:05.550
So the better you do, the
more you get to use it.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.640
And at the end, we'll
have a nice debate.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.970
I call it arguing
with Greenpeace

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.720
when we'll talk
about-- now that you'll

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.930
have known all of the nuclear
science and engineering

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.090
and can speak
scientifically about topics,

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:23.420
we're going to go after a lot
of societal misconceptions.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.460
Do cell phones cause cancer?

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.910
Does living near a nuclear
power plant cause cancer?

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:32.010
Does arguing with
Greenpeace cause cancer,

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.110
whatever it's going to be?

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.120
So I want to make sure
that you're well-equipped

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.580
and confident enough to
go out there and hold

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.580
your own in a vigorous debate
with an angry, emotional

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.960
environmentalist.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.670
You guys will be calm, peaceful,
and informed environmentalists.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.460
After all, that's why a
lot of us are here, is we

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.470
want nuclear energy
to happen because we

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:52.610
care about the environment.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:54.110
There's other people
that don't want

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.652
nuclear energy to
happen because they

00:51:55.652 --> 00:51:57.080
care about the environment.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.687
To each their own, I
guess, motivations.

00:51:59.687 --> 00:52:01.520
But I want to make sure
you're well equipped

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.090
to also tackle things like
is food irradiation bad.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:08.510
That there's all sorts of
websites with dancing babies

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.730
and weird Geocities-like
graphics saying

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:12.290
food irradiation is evil.

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:14.450
You won't find a lot
of scientific articles

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:15.890
if that's the case.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.918
And to see if you'll
put your, let's

00:52:17.918 --> 00:52:19.460
say, cancer risk
where your mouth is,

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.770
the last day of class, we'll
have an irradiated fruit

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.920
party where I'll be buying
only the kinds of fruit that

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.220
can be imported into the US
because food irradiation is

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.030
done.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:31.810
Otherwise, the USDA would
not let it into the country.

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:34.910
And this is mostly things like
mangosteens from Thailand,

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.640
pineapple from Costa Rica.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.050
And interestingly
enough, Hawaii is

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.140
considered a different
country agriculturally.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.230
It is so far away that they have
different agricultural pests.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:46.730
And without
irradiation, we couldn't

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.680
import some of the
produce from Hawaii,

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.810
because it could decimate some
of the crops in the Continental

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:52.640
US.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.520
Pretty crazy, huh?

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.150
Yeah.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.330
It's the-- what, it's the 49th
state, but agriculturally,

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.960
a different country.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.560
So it's about 5 till, so
I'm going to stop here.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.620
And we will start with
radiation-utilizing technology

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:11.180
on Friday, tomorrow,
downstairs in Room 24-121.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.420
And then we'll move over
to my lab at 2 o'clock

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.080
to see the plasma sputter coder.

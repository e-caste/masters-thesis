00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.160
BARBARA IMPERIALI: I always
like to just remind you that

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.620
the sixth --

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.810
it's kind of an assignment,
but the numbers--

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.260
we're going to do this
news brief project, where

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.930
it's a teamwork
project if you choose.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.030
If you take a look at the piece
that you have in your hands

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.190
now, it asks you for a
little bit of information

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.710
on that, who you're
going to be working with,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.720
if you choose to
work with someone.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.110
Or you can work on your own.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.137
That's fine.

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:46.970
And we're looking to
get a news brief that's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.510
of significance to research
going on in the life sciences.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.580
And I've given you-- there
are a couple of links

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.880
in the sidebar of the website,
so good places where you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.040
can find interesting material.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.150
What I'm super
interested in for you,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.930
as a group where many of you
are in the engineering fields,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.760
is to find something really
cool at the interface

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.240
between the life
sciences and engineering,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.240
where engineering has a huge
impact on the life sciences.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.810
You have alternatives.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.500
You can download the
coordinates of a protein

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.470
and print it on a 3D
printer and give us

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.360
a summary of what the
protein is, what it does,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.420
and submit your 3D print.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.920
I'll give it back
to you afterwards,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.240
once we've had a look at it.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.180
But actually submit
the 3D print.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.160
And then the other
opportunity is--

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.290
I think you'll
remember back to when

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.600
we were talking about
molecular biology of the cell.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.080
I did kind of a clunky
demo at the front

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.540
of the class, nothing like
Professor Martin's demos

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.440
at all.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.230
This was me with the
ethernet cables showing you

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.270
what topoisomerase did.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.250
But in my demo,
I didn't show you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.850
how topo also cuts
a strand of DNA,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.940
holds it while the
supercoiling unwinds,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.490
and then stitches it together.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.007
So I thought some
of the engineers

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:04.590
might be able to
come up was something

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.210
that was really better
than that for me to use,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.310
for us to use,
next year in class.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.680
So I'm really laying
down the challenge there.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.470
So I always like
things in the news.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.120
I thought this was
kind of interesting

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.630
that the first vertebrates
evolved in shallow waters.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.470
I thought those were really
cool first vertebrates.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.900
I'd love to get one of them
in a fish tank and keep it.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.270
But anyway, that's that.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.730
It's truly amazing what
you can see in the science

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.710
reports, news briefs.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.660
I look at them
whenever they come in.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.940
I get the posts every
two or three days.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.920
And I'm kind of pleased
to see that there's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.890
a lot of things that
are in those news briefs

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.260
that I feel that we're
enabling you to read

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.570
with some appreciation
because of what

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.440
we're covering in the class.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.310
So what we're doing now is we're
really taking a leap forward

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.000
here into cells and
organisms, with respect

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.140
to understanding how
structure and function

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.130
of individual macromolecules,
proteins, nucleic acids,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.420
sugars, determine life,
determine the dynamics of life

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.530
that are necessary for
an organism to really go

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.920
through a life cycle,
divide, have cells divide,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.660
go forward, have cells move.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.070
So what we're
going to be talking

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.400
about in the next lectures,
which is section 6,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.680
is cellular trafficking
and signaling.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.370
And so for the first lecture,
which is 19 that we're on now--

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.680
so we're past the midway mark--

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.600
I'm going to be talking
about trafficking.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.730
And that is how,
within a cell, things

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.260
get to where they need to be, or
they get exported from a cell.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.690
Because all of the
actions of a cell--

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.180
I really like thinking
about the cell

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.910
as a circuit board, where
there's a receiver that

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.530
gets information.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.000
And then the complex circuitry
determines what outcome

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.740
you get at the end of the day.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.680
So many of the proteins
that we've talked about

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.300
need to be in specific places
for the cell to function.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.820
We have to have DNA
polymerase in the nucleus.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.730
It's not going to be
useful in the cytoplasm.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.270
We have to have a transcription
factor that helps transcription

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.540
go to the nucleus at the
right time for transcription

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.530
to occur.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.330
But we don't want it
there all the time,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.205
because otherwise you'd
have the light switch

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.600
on the entire time.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.620
That wouldn't be useful.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.060
So we need to regulate where
certain macromolecules are.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.570
We need to have the receivers
on the surface of the cell

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.010
to receive signals from outside.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.760
This is not just pertinent
for multicellular organisms.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.420
It's pertinent for
unicellular organisms,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.700
for them to sense
their environment,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.640
know what's going
on around them.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.690
Is the salt
concentration changing?

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.830
Is it getting very hot?

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.240
Is it getting cold?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.010
Is there enough oxygen?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.910
Even unicellular organisms need
to receive signals and respond

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.780
to them.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.950
Multicellular organisms
are way more complicated.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.010
Because you need
to establish organs

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.770
and different parts of
a multicellular organism

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.630
that have specialized function.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.540
So trafficking
really is about what

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.220
happens after you've made a
replicated DNA in the nucleus,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.660
transcribed it, made a mature
messenger that goes out

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.520
to the cytoplasm in most cases.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.070
We'll talk about the
exceptions to that case.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.250
And then in the cytoplasm,
when proteins are expressed,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.800
all the different
things that happen that

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.070
guarantee that the protein
gets to a proper destination

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.270
for function.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.400
And some of those are
quite complicated.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.620
Because remember,
if I'm going to park

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.470
a receiver in the
cellular membrane

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.320
with the signals being
captured from outside,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.910
I've got to get
from the cytoplasm

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.780
out there in a reliable way.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.470
In lectures 20 and
21, I'll talk to you

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.610
about cellular signaling with
a focus on mammalian cells

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.890
and the sorts of
signaling processes

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.600
that may go awry in cells, for
example, proliferating cells.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.820
And then Professor
Martin will really

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.620
focus in on neuronal cells,
optogenetics in lecture 22.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.280
So this bundle really allows
you to call in the things

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.740
that you've learned
until now and apply them

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.280
into much more intriguing
and complex situations.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.380
So here's a wonderful,
sort of silly drawing

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.390
of a triangular cell.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.490
There's always a joke
in cell biologists,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.300
when they're trying to
talk to mathematicians

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.000
and mathematicians want
to simplify everything.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.040
And so everything
gets-- imagine a cell,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.470
and there's this box
shows up on a screen.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.540
Well, we all know
that cells aren't

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.310
triangular or box-shaped.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.310
But nevertheless, I thought
this one was particularly cool.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.730
And so trafficking, the
process of trafficking,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.770
is really all about, where
is the information encoded

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.670
into the protein that ensures
that the protein is where

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.920
it needs to be for the
dynamics that we observe

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.930
in living system?

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.020
We've talked a lot
about static things.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.268
We make the protein.

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.060
Here's the protein.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.410
The protein folds.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.470
We've talked a lot about
things that are kind of fixed

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.590
in time and space.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.380
But what we want
to do is understand

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.760
what makes a cell programmed
to undergo a new function.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.580
For example, something as
simple as cell division,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.800
we have to orchestrate a huge
variety of activities in order

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.770
for the cell division
process to start to occur.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.190
Something as really simple a
cell mobility, think about,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.230
how do cells move?

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.540
They're not moving all the
time, but sometimes they

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.190
will move towards a signal.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.690
What triggers that
kind of interactions?

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.580
So in looking at the cell, these
are some of the older images,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.120
where certain
organelles, for example,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.610
are stained so that
you can see them.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.030
So peroxisomes are where
degradation happens.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.340
The golgi and the ER
are a part of what's

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.890
known as the
endomembrane system.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.980
You'll see a lot about
this towards the later part

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.470
of the class, where
we talk about how

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.310
things get outside the cell
through the endomembrane

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.210
system.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.850
There's the surface
plasma membrane.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.470
The cytoplasm is this sort
of not really aqueous--

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.850
it's an open space.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.200
But it really isn't open.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.870
It's highly congested
with all kinds

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.780
of molecules, all kinds of
structural proteins and so on.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.950
So don't think of the
cytoplasm as a solution,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.520
but think of it as a much more
gel-like structure with a lot

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.400
of things happening in it.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.330
The nucleus itself is also
surrounded by a membrane,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.380
as is the endomembrane system.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.530
So this would be the
nuclear envelope.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.480
Within the nucleus,
you have a structure

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.360
called the nucleolus,
where aspects

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.310
of the nucleic acids necessary
for protein biosynthesis

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.060
are made.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.620
Then there are
structural proteins

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.480
like microtubules and actin.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.360
But now, in this day
and age, we don't

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.940
have to deal with
these vanilla images.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.070
We can actually use
the methods that you've

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.000
learned about in the last
section, recombinant biology,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.070
to create new versions
of proteins that

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.550
have along with their sequence
a marker that gives them

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.600
a fluorescence-colored marker.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.700
So we are, later
on in the semester,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.180
going to spend three lectures
on fluorescence and cellular

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.890
imaging, where you'll learn more
about these fabulous proteins

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.190
beyond just saying we've got
a green one and a red one.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.770
We're going to give you all
the background on the protein

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.695
engineering that enabled those
to become tools for biology.

00:09:56.695 --> 00:09:58.320
But for now, I'm just
going to show you

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.920
how much more interesting
the images of the subcellular

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.290
structures are when
you've labeled,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.550
for example, a particular
protein that goes exclusively

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.120
to the nucleolus with a
blue fluorescent protein,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.680
or to the mitochondria.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.700
Remember, Professor
Martin told you

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.950
we always think of
these as-- and I'm not

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.180
going to do the push-up.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.210
I'm just going to say it,
powerhouse of the cell.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.920
I'm not doing-- [LAUGHS]
I'm not great with push-ups,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.480
to be honest.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.650
But you see these sort of more
tangled, extended structures.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.410
Vimentin is more of
a structural protein.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.560
Here are the golgi, the
endoplasmic reticulum,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.800
and the nucleus.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.150
So the colored
fluorophore proteins,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.520
or the fluorescent
fluorophore proteins,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.290
actually allow us, in real
time, to observe dynamics.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.650
Once a protein is
made, where does it go?

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.300
If we add a trigger to the
cell to cause an interaction,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.000
can we observe that
protein, for example,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.280
migrating to the
plasma membrane.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.670
Can we watch proteins
being made through the ER?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.360
A variety of different things
that allow us in modern biology

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.110
to really look at dynamics,
not just static information.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.010
And so what I'm going
to talk to you about

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.890
is the ways in
which proteins are

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.870
coded very early on in their
genesis, in their biogenesis,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.860
in order to go to certain
locales within the cell.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.540
So let me just give you a bit of
a road map here with a protein.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.710
And where things may start--

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.410
so we have some options.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.860
Do we want to send the
protein outside the cell

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.660
or keep it inside the cell?

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.690
Obviously, two big default
differences, if you're

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.770
going to go to a particular
venue inside the cell.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.840
Are we going to just
stay in the cytosol?

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.470
That's a sort of simple--

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.510
actually, that is
the default position.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.960
Because you want to
remember that most proteins

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.530
are made on ribosomes in
the cytosol of the cell.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.100
But the statistics are
that about 50% of proteins

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.070
end up somewhere else
than the cytoplasm.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.410
They may end up in
an organelle, back

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.900
in the nucleus on the
surface, or secreted.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.860
So there's a lot--

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.280
so it's a good, solid
50% that don't end up

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.540
staying in the cytosol, where
they were originally made.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.300
Their alternative is
to go to organelles.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.600
And if you're going to
an organelle, remember,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.900
the ribosome is not membrane.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.850
It doesn't have a
membrane perimeter.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.360
But many of the organelles
do have membrane perimeters.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.090
So we're talking here
about the mitochondria.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.950
That is far too long of a word.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.280
The nucleus-- so I'm
going to abbreviate things

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.070
like peroxisomes, or various
membrane-bordered organelles,

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.470
where we're going to have
to figure out, if something

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.840
is made in the
cytoplasm, how does it

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.130
get into those organelles?

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.310
Now we've spoken a
little bit about the fact

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.790
that some proteins are
made in the mitochondria.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.790
I'm going to get back
to that in a moment.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.030
But all the proteins
in the mitochondria

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.370
are not made in
the mitochondria.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.230
Some of them are shipped in.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.130
Remember the thing the
endosymbiont theory,

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.410
where we said that
mitochondria may

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.330
have originated from bacteria
and been engulfed into cells.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.260
Those bacteria obviously were
originally self-sufficient.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.540
But a lot of the proteins
that were expressed

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.720
in the mitochondria
were dispensed with,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.630
and mitochondria
now use proteins

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.330
that are encoded by
the nuclear DNA rather

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.680
than the mitochondrial.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.040
But to this day, some
proteins remain encoded

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.730
within the mitochondria.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.920
So these are opportunities
for where that may be.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.150
And I'm going to talk very
specifically about signals

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.540
that can get proteins
into the mitochondria

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.130
and into the nucleus.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.710
And it turns out
that the barriers

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.200
around those organelles
are pretty different.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.880
I'll come back to
that in a second

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.310
when we get on the next slide.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.980
With respect to going
outside the cell,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.550
there are two options.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.890
One option is for the protein
to remain in the plasma membrane

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.860
but with part of its
structure outside the cell.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:56.900
So the other option is
for the protein actually

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.680
to be spit out of the cell
as a soluble entity that

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.340
can travel around an organism,
for example, in the bloodstream

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.930
and go to a remote site.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.750
And that becomes very
important in signaling.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.610
So we would call those
proteins secreted and soluble.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.310
So these would be
membrane-bound.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.920
These would end up
being soluble proteins.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.010
Let's take a look at the
structure of the cell

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.500
and look at where these
various components are.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.880
So if you see these dots,
those are free ribosomes

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.350
in the cytoplasm.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.930
They would start to
express different proteins.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.500
A lot of proteins are
expressed in the ribosome.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.170
But in some cases,
proteins become

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.590
expressed on ribosomes
that are associated

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.930
with the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.210
And therefore, you
start a process

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.540
whereby proteins
end up being shipped

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.410
to the outside of the cell.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.740
So where you see
the speckles here,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.930
the free ribosome,
and then the ribosomes

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.200
bound to the rough
endoplasmic reticulum, here,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.110
your destinies are on
the right-hand side

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.220
of that picture.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.920
And here, the destiny
of these proteins

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.190
ends up on the left-hand side
of this sort of family tree

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.580
that I'm showing you.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.150
There's obviously one more
place where proteins are made,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.040
and that's in the mitochondria.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.130
And if you remember the
first question on your exam,

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.520
it described the DNA
that's in the mitochondria.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.560
Going back to the
endosymbiont theory,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.410
that's a circular piece of DNA.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.970
And it sets it apart.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.000
And the ribosomes
in the mitochondria

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.800
look more like bacterial
ribosomes than you

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.970
eukaryotic ribosomes.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.010
So remember, all
along, we're going

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.800
to try in the second
half of the course

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.380
to bring back knowledge
we've taught you,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.390
but sort of, in a
sense, endlessly

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.270
remind you to keep the
big picture in mind.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.670
Because we've already
spoken to you about it.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.030
So this now is a
nice pictorial vision

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.920
of what I've just
described to you.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.560
And I'm going to first of
all talk about proteins

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.680
that are made in the
cytoplasm and may

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.980
be shipped to
various organelles,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.940
and how that's accomplished.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.980
And then in the second
part of the class,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.250
I'll talk about how proteins
are shipped to cell surface,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.290
or through expulsion
from the cell.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.349
So the key mechanisms
whereby proteins

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.600
are trafficked to new
locations are first

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:41.710
of all using targeting
sequences that are

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.405
part of the protein sequence.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.340
And this is a very common way in
which proteins are trafficked.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.940
They are part of the sequence.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.325
They may be at the amino
or the carboxy terminus.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.810
But they are woven into the
structure of your protein.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.730
So your protein comes along
with a barcode saying where it's

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.760
going to necessarily end up.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:28.430
And for the nucleus
mitochondria and peroxisomes,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.690
for example, people
have done extensive work

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:37.550
with bioinformatics to basically
look up protein sequences

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.570
and find common themes
of particular sequences

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.900
that may be common to where
a set of proteins may end up.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.670
Sometimes those
sequences may not

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.190
be easy to see just
at first glance.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.640
But now there are websites
that you can very, very readily

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.970
put your protein sequence into
the web site, and it will say,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.640
it's got a nuclear
localization sequence,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.460
or a mitochondrial-targeting
sequence.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.190
So we can either do
this by eye or we

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.380
can use informatics analysis.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.840
Informatics analysis
is very valuable

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.290
because sometimes information
may be a bit more encrypted.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.210
And it may be a real
struggle to slog

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.080
through a lot of sequences.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.800
So you can really find out
about the targeting sequences

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.240
through bioinformatics.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:31.010
Because nowadays, the genomes
of dozens and thousands

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.010
of organisms are
available readily online.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.890
And you can literally
parse out information

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.230
from the genomic
information that gives you

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.870
the proteomic information.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.560
So that's one way, so with
sequences that are targeted.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.590
In some cases, those
targeting sequences

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.780
remain part of the protein.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.240
But in other cases,
in order to ensure

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.900
that the protein stays put,
the targeting sequences

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.050
are removed.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.230
So that's another
important point.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.800
You may keep the
targeting sequence,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.430
or you may lose it through the
action of another enzyme that

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.890
cuts off the targeting
sequence when

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.080
destination has been reached.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.270
Now, there's a second
way that we can

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.300
program where a protein may go.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.540
And these are rather
useful transformations that

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.560
make things even more dynamic.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.760
So let me walk you
through a concept.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.580
If you think of a protein
that's made on the ribosome,

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.680
it's got a targeting sequence.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.410
In order to get that
protein to destination,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.960
you've got to make a new
batch of protein that's

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.840
going to go to its destination.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.330
It's going to end up
in the mitochondria.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.250
You've got to make
the protein de novo.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.790
Sometimes when we need to
have the action of a cell

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.170
we can't wait that long.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.920
We can do things quickly
and expect the cell

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.950
to suddenly change
what it's doing.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.320
Because we're sitting around
waiting for the ribosome

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.730
to make new copies
of the protein.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.240
So the second way
in which proteins

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.970
are targeted to
new destinations is

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.760
through what's known
as post-translational

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.840
modifications.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.500
This is so unfair, Adam.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.670
I saw you using
the middle boards,

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.610
but it looked so much easier.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.960
So the second way to target
a protein to a destination

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:45.840
is using post-translational
modification.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.730
What does this mean?

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.390
What it means is that
the protein is made.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.470
It's ready.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.670
It's waiting.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.480
But we haven't engaged
its final destiny.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.400
We haven't triggered it to
go where it needs to be.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.650
But we're waiting for an
enzyme to just carry out

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.540
a seemingly minor
modification of that protein.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.390
And then the protein
will go to its destiny.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.940
And I've shown you
here examples of three

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.860
types of modifications.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.760
One we will talk about today,
because it's very simple

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.910
to understand, lipidation.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.740
And then the other
two, we'll talk

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:32.050
about next time, phosphorylation
and ubiquitination.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.790
And these are all what
are known as PTMs,

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.070
Post-Translational
Modifications.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.960
And they are changes that
occur to an amino acid side

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.700
chain within an already made
protein to alter its destiny.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.740
And I'd like to talk
about lipidation

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:01.080
first, because I get to remind
you about cellular membranes.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.330
So remember, we've talked about
these semipermeable barriers

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:11.180
that are around organelles
and around cells.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.200
And let's say that
this is a membrane--

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.510
I've got to put my--

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:20.490
that exists between
the cytoplasm

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.370
and the outside of a cell.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.900
And let's say I have a
protein lurking around

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.920
in the cytoplasm, but I
need it at the membrane.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.990
I need it to get involved
in a signaling process.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.400
And I need it now to be there.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.880
If I have a soluble
protein, it's not

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.100
associated with the membrane.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.040
But I can use another
enzyme to attach

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.280
a hydrophobic, greasy
tail to that protein.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.160
So what it really
wants to do is to get

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.080
to the hydrophobic membrane.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.750
Lipidation is such
a modification.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:24:03.150
It's just the modification with
a long-chain, often C16, C18,

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.880
fatty acid that then renders
the protein lipophilic

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.750
and makes it want to move, and
insert this lipophilic tail

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:18.190
into the membrane, and part the
protein of the plasma membrane.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.880
So the information
is still, though,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.130
encoded within the protein.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.900
How could that happen?

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.170
How could I have made that
information be in the protein?

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.540
What might be the
strategy there?

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.280
It's still encoded,
but it's secret.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.310
It's cryptic.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.810
Any ideas?

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:47.350
So I'm not going to just glom
this group onto a protein.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.530
I'm going to put it
somewhere specific.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.370
And so oftentimes,
lipidation reactions

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:58.140
occur site-specifically
at particular sites

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.400
within a sequence, and an
enzyme recognizes that site

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.400
and transfers the
lipidic molecule to it.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.220
So lipidation actually
may occur, for example,

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.820
of the amino terminus
of a protein.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.880
But if there are certain
features within that protein,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.710
you may then attach
the lipidic group.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.120
So once again, using
bioinformatics,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.300
you can look at the
target protein of interest

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.110
and predict that it's the
target of a post-translational

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.790
modification reaction.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.730
So once again,
the information is

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.270
programmed into the sequence,
but it's quite cryptic.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.970
It could be within the
middle of the sequence.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.520
There could only maybe
be a couple of clues.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.200
But the clues are
there nonetheless

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.070
that can be parsed out using
computer learning and screening

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.670
of sequences to say that
is a target for lipidation,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.970
or phosphorylation or such.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.340
Is that clear to people?

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.660
Does that make sense?

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.350
The information is encoded, but
you can't see that it's there.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.420
But the advantage of
the post-translational

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.690
modifications is that
they occur on demand,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.680
as opposed to making
a new protein de novo,

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.160
and then having it go to a
particular cellular location.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.460
Later on, when we talk
about phosphorylation,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.570
you will see that
phosphorylation

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.800
is the bread and butter
of cellular signaling.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.690
It's the light
switch in every room

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.110
in the cell that turns on and
off in order to make functions

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.700
happen within the cell.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.510
And that's a really major,
dynamic post-translational

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:37.440
modification that has
significant meaning.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.650
So the reason on
this little image--

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.600
I just wanted to
show you the membrane

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.530
and just remind you that the
membrane is a supramolecular

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.070
structure that's assembled
with a hydrophobic core

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.560
and polar head
groups on both faces,

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.410
as I've sort of indicated
in this cartoon.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.600
So let's start
with sequences that

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.205
might take us to the nucleus.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.100
Now, the nuclear membrane
is rather a strange entity.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.410
Because the nuclear membrane
isn't a simple membrane

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.220
like the plasma membrane.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.920
It's actually a
double-layered membrane.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.880
So if you look at a
nuclear membrane-- and I'm

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:27.540
just going to do a job
of showing a portion

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.310
of the nuclear membrane.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.170
Within the nuclear
membrane, there

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.400
are pores, quite
launch openings.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.510
And the membrane is actually
a double membrane, where

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.840
all of these lipid bilayers.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.265
So it's not a single membrane.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:56.465
It's a double membrane
with large openings.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.180
And you might say,
well, that's no use.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.750
There's just these great big,
gaping holes in the nucleus.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.120
Anything can come
and go if it wants.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.780
But the nuclear pores are
kind of a special structure.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.920
Because they have a protein
that's kind of disordered,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.740
that creates a tangled network.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.500
That means that that
pore isn't totally open,

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.150
but there's some
stuff that something's

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.120
got to get through to get
from one side to the other.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.630
And my colleague Thomas
Schwartz in biology works

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.360
on the macromolecular
structure of nuclear

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.820
pores to understand
these structures.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.060
Because these are also
made through the auspices

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.840
of having a lot of proteins
that help create this structure.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.720
Otherwise, that
membrane wouldn't

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.090
stay in its proper format.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.190
So in order for a protein
to get into the nucleus,

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.490
if it needs to, or
leave the nucleus,

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.950
it has to have some
kind of mechanism

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.070
to get through this
structure that's

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.540
plugging the nuclear pore.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.580
So this would be the
inside of the nucleus.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.610
And this would be the cytoplasm.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.160
So as shown on this
slide, the nucleus,

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.570
there's a particular
protein sequence

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.520
that's appended to a protein.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.120
That's known as the Nuclear
Localization Sequence, or NLS.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.200
And what an NLS
sequence is, it's

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.750
a short sequence
of amino acids that

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.170
enables a protein to get
to its proper destination.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.260
And these sequences are
quite well recognized.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.320
They may end up being
highly basic sequences.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.601
So an example of an
NLS would be Lys--

00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.290
it's not very
exciting, but it just

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:59.810
goes on, Lys, Lys,
Lys, arginine, lysine.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.640
And it may be bounded
by hydrophobic residues

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.460
or other types.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:10.520
So that would be a typical NLS
sequence that's in a protein.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:19.090
And I want to remind you that
lysine and arginine all have

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.630
side chains that
at physiological pH

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.970
are positively charged.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.670
So the nuclear
localization sequence

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.210
is something that's
easily recognized because

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.060
of this sort of
short sequence that

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.740
may be at the N- or C-terminus.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.540
I think there's
either possibility.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.250
But it's a very clear sequence.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.500
You could look at your
protein sequence and say,

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.630
there's an NLS on that sequence.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.480
And it's the NLS
sequence alone that's

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.330
responsible for
getting the proteins in

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.250
and out of the nuclear pore.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.385
Let's mostly focus on
getting into the nucleus.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.710
Basically, you have
a protein structure

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.560
that has an NLS sequence
at one terminus.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.010
And that NLS sequence
binds to another protein.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.640
Creatively, you had a
little bit of chance

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.250
to give proteins
names in the exam.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.750
It's called importin.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:24.040
So it's an import protein
that binds to the NLS,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.490
and as a consequence of
that, will carry cargo.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.090
It will escort cargo into
the nucleus of the cell.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.920
And it sends it through
this meshwork of proteins.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.250
That's a very loose
mesh work of proteins.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.350
And they're not
ordered proteins.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.690
They're highly
disordered proteins.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.455
So they make more of
a filter than a plug.

00:31:46.455 --> 00:31:47.830
But they are
definitely something

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.500
that doesn't allow
any old protein to go

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.090
through that nuclear pore.

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:55.840
NLS tags are very easy
to recognize, once again,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.413
through bioinformatics analysis.

00:31:58.413 --> 00:31:59.830
And what's really
cool is that you

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.320
can reprogram a
protein to be where you

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.930
want by manipulating the NLS.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.880
So this is rather a
nice set of experiments.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.290
Let's say we have a protein
that we're going to micro-inject

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.540
into the cytoplasm of the cell.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.080
And we want to program it to
either go into the nucleus

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.150
or stay outside the nucleus.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.730
That can be done
readily by attaching

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.940
a nuclear localization
sequence to a protein

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.020
along with a fluorophore dye
or fluorescent protein that

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.900
will allow you to
observe that experiment.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.230
If you micro-inject
into the cytoplasm,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.940
that protein that's got an NLS
will get run into the nucleus

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.250
through association of
the NLS with importin.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.140
But if you chop that NLS,
the protein the stuck,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.570
remains out in the cytoplasm.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.610
Let's say you want to
study a new protein.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.010
I just want to show
you that these NLS

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:58.480
sequence are totally independent
of the cargo they carry.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.270
You can just stick an NLS
on your favorite protein

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.030
who you want to interrogate.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.850
Let's take pyruvate kinase.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.140
It doesn't have anything to
do with specific transport

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.220
to the nucleus.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.370
But nevertheless, if you put--

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.080
if it doesn't have an NLS,
it's fluorescently labeled,

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.870
it stays outside
in the cytoplasm.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.700
But if you put an
analysis on it,

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.470
you concentrate into
that region of the cell.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.830
So these experiments
show you that what

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.020
we know about these
targeting sequences

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.820
can be manipulated and used
to enable you to move things

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.930
around in the cell.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.140
So that's one particular
type of mechanism.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.400
The next mechanism I
want to describe to you

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:45.610
is the mechanism that's used
for mitochondrial transports.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.055
And it's a little bit
different in its strategy.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.090
So to get into the mitochondria,
there is, again, a recognition

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:07.130
sequence, in this case, a
mitochondrial localization

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.400
sequence that has
particular characteristics.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:17.940
In this case, the mitochondrial
localization sequence,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.310
let's say it's at the
N-terminus of your protein.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.510
And it would be something that
might be a mix of charges.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:32.750
Some Arg, Glu, Arg, Glu.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.449
So that's a typical
MLS sequence.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:39.980
And in this case, the
charge at physiological pH

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.429
is different from the nuclear
localization sequence,

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.670
because it's an alternating
positive and negative charge.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.530
So this is pretty
different from this.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.179
It doesn't say bioinformatics
to figure that one out.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.679
So you can then pick out
mitochondrial localization

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.949
sequences.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:59.090
And so in this case,
remember, mitochondria

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.140
make some of their own
proteins on their circular DNA.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.710
But they've abandoned
expressing all the proteins that

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.540
are needed in the mitochondria.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.060
And some proteins
are transported

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.780
into the mitochondria using
these types of sequences.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.940
But the approach,
the strategy, is

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.670
different from getting
into the nucleus.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.710
In this case, the MLS
sequence associates

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.520
with a protein channel
that is in a closed state.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.090
So here's a membrane.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.790
Here's the makings of a channel.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.530
But it's in a closed state.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.370
But once the protein with the
NLS sequence binds to that,

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.830
that channel opens.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.320
It's triggered by the
binding of that sequence

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.420
to a portion of the protein
that's outside that membrane.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.590
And that then allows the protein
to be unfolded and transported

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:55.940
into the mitochondria, where
that sequence may be removed.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.070
And then protein refolds
in the mitochondria.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.070
So it's a very
different strategy

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.860
for that and the nuclear
localization sequence.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.850
So you'll find, for many
different organelles

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.900
in the cell, there might be very
specific localization sequences

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.250
that you could look
up and learn about.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.220
But one thing I want
to mention to you

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.850
is that these localization
details are very important.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:23.840
And many diseases in
cells are a consequence

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.570
of proteins not being
localized to the right place.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.260
If you're not in the right
place at the right time,

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.510
then things will
start to go wrong

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.730
with the signaling or the
processes of the cell.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.470
So diseases are
frequently associated

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.360
with mislocalization.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:48.450
So now what we're going
to do is basically say,

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.720
we've taken care of
understanding things made

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.680
in the cell.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.570
They either stay in
the cytosol or they'll

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.950
go to organelles based on
particular types of strategies

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:03.450
that are largely dependent
on short tagging sequences,

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.380
but in other cases, may be
dependent on post translational

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.360
modification.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:09.860
All right.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.990
So here is a cartoon.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.020
But actually, I want to do
something slightly different

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.530
if it doesn't take too long.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.710
Now, when we first
talked about translation

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.010
on the ribosome, what you
see there in green and yellow

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.210
is the ribosome.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.790
The dark band is
a messenger RNA.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.550
The dark blue are
transfer RNAs that

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:37.050
are being helped with elongation
factors to get to the ribosome.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.910
But what I want
to point out here

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.420
is the emerging
sequence of polypeptide

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.970
coming out through a
tunnel on the ribosome.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.710
Now, if a protein is going to
be destined outside the cell,

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.050
it is expressed with what's
known as a signal sequence.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.380
It's about a
20-amino acid residue

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.400
sequence that is recognized
by the signal recognition

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.630
particle.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:04.290
And then translation
slows down and clamps

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.990
the ribosome on the
endoplasmic reticulum

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.350
membrane so that the
new peptide starts

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.010
being threaded into the
endoplasmic reticulum

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.680
through what's known
as the translocon.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.120
So you're now not sending the
protein out to the cytoplasm,

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.400
but you're rather
sending the protein

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.050
into the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:31.050
And you're also sending it
down this branch of the protein

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.760
biosynthesis pathway.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.400
You see this piece
of protein emerging.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.510
This hatched portion
is the cytoplasm.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.720
The gray portion is the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.470
So there is a complex
machinery at play

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:50.460
that enables proteins to
be made in the cytoplasm

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.772
but now targeted to a
completely new location.

00:38:53.772 --> 00:38:55.230
And these are the
proteins that are

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.980
going to be destined to either
stay in the plasma membrane

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.050
or be secreted from the cell.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.680
And this view here gives
you a little bit more

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.910
than the cartoon.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.640
So ribosome-- a
signal peptide is

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.490
made that is a green
peptide sequence that's

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.890
about 20 amino acids long.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.160
That is actually called
a signal peptide.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.500
It's signaling for
synthesis through

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.750
the endomembrane network.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:26.160
That causes the ribosomes to
dock down on the cytosol ER

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.040
membrane and keep
on being synthesized

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.880
so that proteins are made
into that endomembrane system.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.190
And you can think of this
cavernous endomembrane

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.510
system as your tunnels out
of a cell for either display

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:43.170
on the surface of the cell
or for secretion entirely

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.350
in vesicles.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.550
So let's take a look
at how that occurs.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.920
When you make a
protein in that way,

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.400
see the dark dots, the rough ER?

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.180
These are ribosomes that are
attached to the membrane.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.550
Proteins are made
into the membrane.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.120
And then the endomembrane
system is not really

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.540
just a tunnel or a labyrinth.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.610
But actually, each
of those layers

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:12.120
spits off vesicles that
fuse with next layers

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.840
to gradually make their
way outside of the cells.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.850
So here you see
there are vesicles.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.430
You're always keeping
proteins associated

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:24.310
with membrane as you go through
the endomembrane system.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:27.120
And here is a vesicle
that's got protein in it.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.570
It may either release it
to the outside of the cell,

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:34.650
or the protein may be
associated with the membrane

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:38.760
of the vesicle and stay
parked in the plasma membrane.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.990
And so I just want to give
you one final slide where

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.310
I talk about the biogenesis
of membrane proteins.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.180
Now, this is pretty
complicated stuff.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.540
Because you have to remember
what's inside and out.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.490
So I spent more time than I
should have on this cartoon

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.430
to show you which
end of the protein

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.100
ends up outside the cell
and which inside the cell,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.490
and how you make
multi-membrane-spanning

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:06.130
proteins.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.030
So let's take a look at this
in detail now, looking--

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.620
here's the ribosome.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.720
Here's the protein emerging.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.580
If there's signal
sequence there,

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.280
that ribosome docks
down on the membrane

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.300
and starts translating the
protein, amino terminus

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.730
first, into the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.800
We'll all OK with that.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.576
As synthesis continues, we
may reach the stop codon

00:41:30.576 --> 00:41:32.640
on the messenger RNA.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.820
And what may happen is
that the protein may remain

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.710
associated with membrane.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.020
The amino terminus
will be in the ER.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.910
And the C-terminus will
remain on the other side.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:46.650
There are a number of
different configurations.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:50.490
But if we want to start
to transport this protein

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:53.280
to the surface of the
cell, that will then

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.890
stay associated with
membrane but not

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:59.330
in the form of the flat membrane
that it was delivered into.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:04.320
But that membrane may pinch
off into a spherical vesicle.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.720
But you still have
the C-terminus outside

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.000
and the N-terminus inside.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.730
That will then work
its way through

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.110
the endomembrane system,
and ultimately, fuse

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.190
with the cytosol.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:20.190
This is the really fun part.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.305
And then, once it's
fused with the cytosol,

00:42:22.305 --> 00:42:24.660
it has the option
to be displayed

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.410
on the outside of the cell.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:26.910
Why?

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.620
You have a protein.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.450
The N-terminus is
on the outside.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.610
The C-terminus is on the inside.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.090
So that shows you the
biogenesis of the cell surface

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.130
protein that's stuck
in the membrane

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:41.580
through its
membrane-associated domain.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.900
If you're not going to
stay with the membrane,

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.530
you can actually also
simply release this

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:50.010
into the vesicle for release
of a soluble protein.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.330
I will not go through this.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.940
But there are
miraculous steps that

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:58.320
end up in the biogenesis of
multi-transmembrane proteins.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.870
Because each of those
transmembrane domains

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.400
gets made in the translocon
and gets shuttled sideways.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.620
And you start piling up
transmembrane domains

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.060
that span the membrane.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.800
And in the next
class, we're going

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.090
to see how useful these proteins
are in cellular signaling.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.990
So those are very important
proteins to think about.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:22.020
One last thing-- so
let's think about this.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:27.090
For either configuration, either
post-translational modification

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:31.440
or using targeting sequences,
when do we define where

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.660
the protein's going to end up?

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.625
Where's the information
first defined?

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:42.730
Anyone want to answer
me and explain why?

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:43.424
Yes?

00:43:43.424 --> 00:43:45.400
AUDIENCE: Would it be
B, the mRNA sequence,

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.353
because that would have
a significant portion

00:43:47.353 --> 00:43:48.020
of the splicing?

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.490
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
It's a good try.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.760
But you want to remember,
yes, splicing is important.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.400
But when was the
sequence actually

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.660
in the entire pre-mRNA?

00:44:03.773 --> 00:44:05.190
When would that
have been defined?

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.040
Yeah?

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:09.540
Sorry.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.350
Carmen?

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:13.570
AUDIENCE: Is it in the
genomic DNA sequence?

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:14.560
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yes.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.040
Because you never have
information in the RNA

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.490
that wasn't in the DNA.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.790
So the DNA has got
the information there.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.880
Yeah, it may need a bit
of splicing to put things

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.390
in the right place.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.780
But the information
is there in the DNA.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.280
So you want to remember, for all
of this targeting information,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.310
it's in the genomic
information most commonly.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.870
It's the genomic
information that

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:41.050
has the patterns of sequences
for post-translational

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:42.150
modification.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.470
It's the genomic
information that has

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.990
things like NLSes and MLSes.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.320
They're already there.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.350
But they are often encrypted.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.510
And there was a very
nice point there, though.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:58.240
If you want to send to make a
single chunk of a genome that

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:02.350
encodes either a protein
that's going to be exported

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:06.430
through the secretory pathway
or stay in the cytosol,

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.120
you might splice in or
out a signal sequence.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.750
So that's a really good way,
using the same original DNA

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.420
sequence, to actually
get to proteins

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.870
that fulfill different final
destinies within the cell.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.120
So next time, we're going
to talk about signaling.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.240
It's going to be a blast.

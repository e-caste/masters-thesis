00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.290
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
OK, any burning

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.480
issues from last time or
earlier, before I begin?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.190
OK, we're going to do a little
primer on climate science

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.160
and a very little primer
on the science and a primer

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.050
on the policy.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.610
This could easily take
more than a semester.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.700
But we'll do it in
an hour and a half.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.960
So what I'm going to mostly do
is do what economists often do,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.920
which is to say, well, let's
suppose we have a tsar.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
Let's suppose we have a
tsar, who can set policy.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.610
What would the tsar
do about climate?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.310
Let's assume it's a modern
tsar, not a denyist tsar.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.530
I'm going to argue
and try to indicate

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
to you why, even for a tsar,
this would be a hard problem.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.470
This is the hardest
public policy

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.010
problem I've ever come near.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.850
So today, we have a tsar.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.820
Wednesday and Friday, we don't.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.110
It's like the real world.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.890
And we will go through a
negotiation in which you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.320
will be, as you know, on teams.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.210
We'll talk a little bit
about that at the end

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.610
because we're going to have
to do some adjustments.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.230
You all want to
be rich countries.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.120
You can't all be rich countries.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.270
Some of you have to be poor.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.760
It's like life.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.740
All right, so let me do a
very little bit of background

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.200
on the science and then talk
about why it's a hard policy

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.660
problem.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.420
You've probably seen this graph.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.690
This is from NASA.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.340
Global temperatures are rising.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.670
If you look at the
last few years,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.990
it looks like a slowdown.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.120
This has been much debated.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.950
The latest evidence
suggests this

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.830
is because of La Nina
conditions in the Pacific,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.460
which tend to lower
the temperature.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.190
And solar radiation is at
a minimum in its cycle.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.410
Those who follow
these things closely

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.890
expect, when we go to El Nino
conditions in the Pacific,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.410
that we will break
previous records.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.200
Nine of the 10 warmest
years on record

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.640
have been in this century.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.280
So if you smooth,
and you see there's

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.040
a lot of variability year
to year, if you smooth,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.860
the trend is reasonably clear.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.170
That's data.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.980
This is inference.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.180
There's strong evidence,
backed by theory,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.250
that human activity has
a lot to do with this.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.810
This is a global greenhouse
emissions by gas in 2004.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.940
You'll see, on the right,
CO2 from fossil fuel use

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.040
is a big contributor,
not the only contributor.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.480
I think CO2 other is
probably cement manufacture.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.190
This is land use, deforestation,
biomass, agriculture,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.930
and so forth.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.760
Methane, nitrous oxide, which
is a nasty, long-lived gas,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.430
largely comes from agriculture.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.350
Methane comes, of course,
from a variety of sources.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.200
And then there are a
bunch of long-lived,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.040
very potent, but very small,
very low-concentration gases.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.000
This is by sector.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080
And again, you can see
an awful lot of this

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.130
is human activity obviously,
but generating electricity,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.620
manufacturing, transportation.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.730
And again, you get
land use and forestry.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.250
So it's a range.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.815
This is later data, but
it doesn't show it by gas.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.190
There are a wide variety
of activities involved

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.490
that emit heat-trapping gases.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.070
And again, there's
evidence, there's

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.340
theory that suggests that
this is really a driver.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.240
The changes in solar
radiation, the El Nino, La Nina

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.370
is not big enough.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.620
Yeah?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.402
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] put the
carbon content [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:37.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Largely.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.310
You also lose soil carbon.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.990
If you cultivate and till
the soil, you'll lose.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.780
You'll have an effect.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.550
You'll reduce what's
stored in the soil.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.160
So it's mostly deforestation.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.730
But it can also be just
agricultural practices.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.090
OK.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.700
But deforestation is crucial.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.540
We're going to talk mostly
about CO2 from fossil fuels

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.820
because that's where
the policy action is

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.400
and also deforestation.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.260
Mostly because you can
measure fossil fuel use

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.270
relatively easily.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.360
Figuring out how agriculture
generates nitrous oxide

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.510
is harder, much
harder to measure.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.810
But fuel use is relatively easy.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.360
Deforestation is
relatively easy to measure.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.840
So you can actually
imagine agreements

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.530
that might be enforceable.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.620
So that's where the
policy action is.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.990
We also know-- whoops.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.740
Back.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.500
We also know that there
have been some clear impacts

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.540
of climate change.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.200
This is everybody's seen this.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.580
This is the change in sea
ice since September of '79

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.830
to September of 2007.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.260
And obviously, that continues.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.760
This is a projection.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.830
And it can only be a
projection, for reasons

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.290
I want to talk about, of
days over 100 degrees.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.950
And you see, gee, there,
it gets hot in the desert.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.680
But the problem with this
is mainly human health.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.280
People who are fragile
in a variety of ways

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.260
or who aren't air
conditioned don't deal well

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.280
with large numbers of
days over 100 degrees.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.390
It happened in Europe
a couple of years ago.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.880
There were a number of--

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.110
more than a number, a
fair number of deaths.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.570
So these are obvious impacts.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.700
If it gets warmer, you
have more hot days.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.670
If it gets warmer,
the sea ice melts.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.350
But that's a small part
of the story is warming.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.713
So why is this hard?

00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:52.130
Why is this a hard
policy problem?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.440
Step reason one is
the time scales.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.380
And the time scales, CO2 doesn't
come out of the atmosphere

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.610
by simple exponential decay.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.070
The process is complicated.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.040
But if you think
about a half life,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.060
you want to think about
around a century, if you can

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.730
think of it in half life terms.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.580
Not only does the stuff
stay up there a long time,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.340
but it takes a long
time for its effects.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.640
For the Earth to be in
equilibrium, depending

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.970
on how much heat is coming
in and being trapped,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.520
you got to warm the deep ocean.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.200
The deep ocean is deep.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.480
Heat diffuses slowly.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.920
So it takes a while to warm.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.100
So we're not in equilibrium now.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.860
And the question of how far
out of equilibrium we are

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.040
is kind of a serious one.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.190
So even if you cut
emissions sharply now,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.110
warming would
continue for decades.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.350
Given that we're not going
to cut emissions sharply,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.890
we're dealing with centuries.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.870
And in this literature,
people run out

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.560
to 2100 and typically out
beyond 2100 in thinking

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.590
about a variety of things.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.040
Most human problems don't
have time scales like that.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.150
It means that
actions taken today

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.340
will affect your grandchildren.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.920
That's not true in
most areas of policy.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.830
You can do tax policy
lots between now

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.380
and the time your
grandchildren vote.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.150
But CO2, it's still
going to be there.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.211
The CO2 emitted today will
still be there in large quantity

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:34.669
when your grandchildren
are walking

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.370
around blaming you for it.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.530
So if we have a
climate tsar, he has

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.850
to think about how to
treat people not yet born

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.970
because actions today will
affect people not yet born.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.000
I mean this is a
typical example.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.910
This is somebody's
story of what gets

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.000
flooded in Florida if you get
about a meter sea level rise.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.090
A meter sea level rise is
sort of order of magnitude

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.210
what might happen in a century.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:13.700
What's it worth today
to prevent that in 2112?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.330
For reference, my mother
lives there, more or less.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.830
So she's OK.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.480
On the other hand,
she's 90 years old.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.940
This doesn't apply to her.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.930
But it will apply, potentially,
to great-great-grandchildren.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.090
So timescales of
a century or more

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:38.300
are hard because you
know you want a discount.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.100
But how do you do that?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.630
This is a live controversy.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.130
I'm not going to
give you an answer.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.920
Economists have nasty
arguments about this.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.940
There are three ways you
might want to think about it.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.470
The obvious way to
think about, what

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.270
am I going to do about
a century from now,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.480
is to just think about
the private sector.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.270
Well, I could put it in a
bank, or I could invest it

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.890
in a business, or
I could invest it

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.730
in dealing with climate change.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.440
I make that choice.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.060
So I ought to be using the
same kind of discounting

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.320
in both decisions, right?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.650
Because I don't want
to have an imbalance.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.140
You missed the science.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.140
You could have fixed it.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.990
This is Professor Solomon
who has forgotten more

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.860
about climate science than I
could ever aspire to learn.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.790
At any rate, we're
talking about policy.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.210
And we're talking
about discounting

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.940
and why this is hard.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:37.250
So one school of
thought says, you've

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.580
got to use a private
sector discount rate.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.980
And one reason this
school of thought

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.180
achieved prominence was the
Army Corps of Engineers, when

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.120
deciding whether or
not to build dams,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.240
always used a very
low discount rate.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.170
Dams last a long time.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.800
So if you use a very
low discount rate,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.050
dams look pretty
promising economically.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.892
And it was a huge slog
in the '50s and '60s

00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:08.100
to get the Corps of Engineers
to use a private sector

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.070
rate, to say, you can
build this kind of plant,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.540
or you can build a dam.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.480
You ought to use the same
discount rate in both cases.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.880
You ought to use the private
sector rate to think about

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.695
whether or not you build dams.

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:22.570
There's a second school
of thought that says,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.153
wait a minute.

00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:27.180
This isn't really a
private sector decision.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.010
If you think about
optimal growth theory,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.370
optimal growth
theory usually says--

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.580
let me not do more than
wave my hands at that--

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.910
usually says there
are two reasons

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.980
you discount the future.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.870
Forget the private
sector for the moment.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.070
If you're doing everything
optimally in the economy,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.987
there are two reasons
you discount the future.

00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:52.080
One, there might be a pure rate
of time preference, whatever

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.150
that might mean.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.620
And you value benefits in the
future less than benefits today

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.320
because people in the
future will be richer.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.850
And, therefore-- being just
a little bit quick with

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.100
the hands--

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.180
income on the
margin's worth less.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.130
If I were in the future
and I were richer,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.710
then $1 worth of benefit
would be worth less to me

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.600
then than it is now.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.770
I'll take that into account.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.960
I'll discount that second
term because people

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.118
will be wealthier says,
you make a judgment.

00:12:26.118 --> 00:12:26.910
There are formulas.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.470
I won't trouble you.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.050
There are formulas that say,
here's how you deal with that.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.430
And then you say, well,
I have a preference.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.950
We all have preference
for today over tomorrow.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.950
That's a pure rate
of time preference.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:45.030
The third approach that's
coming into the literature

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.820
recently says, why do you have
a pure rate of time preference?

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.380
What does that mean?

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.850
That discriminates
between generations.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.080
The pure rate of time preference
says, even if my grandchildren

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.270
are no richer than
I am, I'm going

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.220
to value $1 to them
less than $1 to me.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.900
That doesn't make moral sense.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.280
So I would use a zero rate
of pure time preference

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.540
and then make a judgment, if I
want to, about how much richer

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.790
they will be and how
much that ought to matter

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.460
when I think about benefits.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.990
Now, I present this not--

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.080
those are very
different positions.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.940
And they have very
different implications

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.750
for how you think
about the future.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.690
And I have to tell
you, depending

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.710
on the day of the week and the
weather, I myself vacillate.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.790
But let me just give
you the implications.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.350
Let's take rates to
illustrate these.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.930
7% and 3% are used in federal
government decision making.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.730
The 7%, you might think of as
like a private sector rate.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.750
The 3% gets down to that second
category, the pure rate of time

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.940
preference plus an adjustment.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:09.810
And 1% was used in an
influential report on climate

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.920
change that takes the third
position, no pure rate of time

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.360
preference, no discrimination
between generations.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.430
So let's apply that to
$1 million in 100 years.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.670
All right, if I use 1%,
that $1 million in 100 years

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.430
is worth $368,000.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.410
So I'd spend a fair amount.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.300
I wouldn't spend
$1 million today.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.352
But I'd spend a fair
amount to avoid a 1 million

00:14:36.352 --> 00:14:37.435
dollar's worth of damages.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.480
3%, woo.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.370
I wouldn't spend
very much at all

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.150
to avoid 1 million
dollar's worth of damages.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.440
And at 7%, we get what a
guy who used to work for me

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.320
called the magic ray gun.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.690
You let me discount anything at
7% in the future, it goes away.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.190
It's a disappearing function.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.120
I would spend $9,000 today to
avoid 1 million dollar's worth

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.900
of damages in 100 years if
I use that discount rate.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.160
It matters a lot.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.650
It matters a lot.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.640
And there's no
easy way to decide,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.670
I think, to decide
among these views.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.955
If you scratch most economists,
they come down here at 3%.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.830
But if you ask them,
well, wait a minute.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.790
Aren't you crowding out
private investments?

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.040
They say, oh, well, maybe.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.780
Maybe not.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.240
And if you ask them, well,
why are you discriminating

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.880
against future generations
with this pure rate of time

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.080
preference?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.500
Where does that come from?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.770
Most people go, well,
yeah, that's a point.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.040
So you can make arguments
for all three of these.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.870
And they have very
different implications.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.990
The tsar will have to choose.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.830
See the issue?

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.390
I hope.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.670
If you're talking about
five years, 10 years,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.110
it doesn't matter that much.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.540
If you're talking about 100
years, which we are here,

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.380
it does, or more.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.760
OK, that's hard.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.200
And it's hard for the tsar.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.987
It's not just hard politically.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.400
So that's one reason
why it's hard.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.000
The tsar is willing to
make sacrifices today

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.160
for generations not yet
born or even thought of.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.250
Many other people, who aren't
as farsighted as the tsar,

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.730
may have trouble doing
that or voting to do that.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.370
That's a tough trade off, right?

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.460
We could reduce
emissions today sharply,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.800
and it wouldn't make
much difference to us,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.050
might not make much
difference to us,

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.300
might make some difference
to our children,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.353
might make a lot of
difference to their children.

00:16:54.353 --> 00:16:56.770
You can't even imagine having
grandchildren at this point,

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.100
right?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.600
All right?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.280
I hope.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.870
But you will.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.900
And so will they.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.640
OK, that's one
reason why it's hard

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.829
because it's hard to think
in terms of a century

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:13.520
when you're making
decisions today or more.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.940
A second reason why this
is hard even for the tsar

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.534
is uncertainty.

00:17:19.534 --> 00:17:26.609
And one of the things Professor
Solomon and I have learned

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.940
is you can't say uncertain
in public discourse.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.280
Because uncertain to the
public means, my god,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.110
I don't have a clue.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.960
What uncertain means
in this context is,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.060
I may not know the
probability distribution.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.130
But there is a
probability distribution.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.050
It's not oh my.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.910
And it's not
infinitely spread out.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.480
If you think about
elements of uncertainty,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.790
what will the atmosphere
look like in 100 years

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.650
if we don't do anything?

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.770
Well, you know, that
depends on population.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.820
Does China collapse?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.870
Does China not collapse?

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.910
It depends on future
economic growth.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.650
It depends on the
mix of activity.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.140
What happens to manufacturing
versus services?

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.930
It depends on new technologies.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.940
Somebody comes up
with cheap storage.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.470
The world moves to solar power.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.280
It's a very different world
than if that doesn't happen.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.030
Those are all big uncertainties.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.470
So we don't really know what
emissions will look like.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.290
There are uncertainties
about the climate system,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.480
serious uncertainties
about the climate system,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.670
not that we don't know anything.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.920
But as I mentioned,
there's this issue of,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.010
how fast will the
deep ocean warm?

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.920
There are issues of
irreversibility and tipping

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.150
points, potentially.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.670
Did you want to talk about
that and say a word about some

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.620
of these uncertainties?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.090
Can I provoke you
into a comment?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.880
SUSAN SOLOMON: Possibly.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.213
I guess I'm not quite sure
where you want to go with it.

00:18:56.213 --> 00:19:00.720
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Oh, I just
want some illustrative detail

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.010
or some examples of things
that might be a concern

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.470
or that might be
nonlinearities or that might

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.850
be like falling off a table.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:10.600
SUSAN SOLOMON: OK.

00:19:13.442 --> 00:19:15.400
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
want to take a second?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.680
Just take a second.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.600
I hate to waste the resource.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.120
SUSAN SOLOMON: I'll do my best.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.250
This issue of tipping
points, in my mind,

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.880
is actually a lot more
difficult than the issue

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.510
of irreversibility.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.140
The irreversibility problem,
we can talk about a little bit

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.180
more clearly.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:40.690
For example, if it were to
be the case that Arctic sea

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.610
ice were to disappear,
you might imagine

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.840
that that would be an
irreversible process.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.610
But I think we're
finding, more and more,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.920
that it actually isn't.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.890
Even though we had very
low Arctic sea ice in 2007,

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.290
because we have
such cold winters,

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.640
we have the ability to reform
the sea ice because it's thin.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.680
Even when you have
multiyear ice,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.060
it's still relatively thin.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.370
It's only a few
years that matters.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.370
But when we, for
example, do something

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.860
that causes a big dent in
the Greenland ice sheet,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.950
now that truly is
something that you could

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.430
think about as irreversible.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.790
It's going to take a
very, very long time.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.560
So on human timescales, it's
essentially irreversible

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.160
if you lose a big piece of
the Greenland ice sheet.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.820
Is there a tipping point
beyond which the Greenland ice

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.970
sheet might kind of
suddenly fall apart

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.580
is something that's been raised.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.920
Much more of a
controversial issue.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.870
It's conceivable.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.500
But most scientists
who study the ice

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.340
would argue that it's more
likely to be a slow process.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.550
But it's possible.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.950
And one of the
things that could be

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.860
a tipping point for the
Arctic, that people have also

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.890
talked about, of course,
is methane release

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:08.920
from things like undersea
deposits of methane

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.080
that are actually tied up in
formations called clathrates

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.480
and also in permafrost,
which you're probably

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.660
more familiar with.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.980
So there are ways
to trigger things

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.210
that, in the tipping point
framework, usually involve ice.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.070
And you can sort of
see why that would be.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.540
It's either ice, or it's not.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.490
There is slow transition
from one to another.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.450
It's a real change of state.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.325
So that's some ideas.

00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:38.325
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:21:38.325 --> 00:21:39.130
Thank you.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.330
Thank you.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.960
So that's hard.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.430
The tsar has to think about
those possibilities, which

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.910
we know something.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.010
But we don't know.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.540
We can't tell when
that might occur,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.040
if those things might occur.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.100
Even climate models,
complex simulation models

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.450
of the climate system--

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.700
and there are a number of them--

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.520
disagree on what
happens regionally.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.360
Will it be wetter or drier?

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.310
Well, that matters a lot.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.240
It matters a lot whether
it'll be wetter or drier

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.380
in particular areas.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.310
Well, let me just say that.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.680
Also, we don't have
good predictions

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:33.090
for the impacts on hurricanes,
more, more intense,

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.650
none of the above.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.840
More water goes into the
air because it's warmer.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.483
It comes down.

00:22:37.483 --> 00:22:38.400
How does it come down?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.680
Where does it come down?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.550
Very uncertain implications
for regional impacts.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.000
Regional impacts will
take us into new ground,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.290
particularly for ecosystems.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.670
We don't quite know how
ecosystems will respond

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.200
because we haven't done it.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.020
It's not an easy experiment.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.970
So damages, effects like
rainfall are uncertain.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:14.550
The implications of those
effects are also uncertain.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.380
And finally, there's
little experience

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.380
in sort of, how do human
civilizations react

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.250
to large-scale environmental
changes of various kinds?

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.170
I've been seeing, on
Google News, reference

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.810
to small changes
in rainfall being

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.390
the likely culprit in the
downfall of the Mayans,

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.800
maybe 20%, 30% reductions,
not huge droughts.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.910
Sensitive enough.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.310
Are poor countries in the
tropics that sensitive?

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.030
Probably not.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.850
How sensitive?

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.370
All right, finally, the
cost of emissions reductions

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.510
are also uncertain.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.630
So the tsar is going to
have to deal with this.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.420
And the tsar is going to
have to deal with the fact

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.920
that we will be
learning as we go.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.288
So this is I now go to my
favorite picture from the--

00:24:02.288 --> 00:24:04.330
so you can't do cost
benefit analysis because you

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.163
don't know the cost.

00:24:05.163 --> 00:24:08.210
And you don't know the benefits.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.750
So the tsar can't
just do the arithmetic

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.570
because he doesn't know
the cost or the benefits,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.180
even if he could
do the discounting.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.410
A problem like this needs
adaptive or iterative risk

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.610
management.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.270
And you can read that in
the report of the Committee

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.450
on America's Climate Choices,
on which Professor Solomon and I

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.280
both served.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.210
If you think about steering a
ship in iceberg-infested waters

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:41.490
at night before radar,
to avoid the Titanic,

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.400
the elements of what a
sensible skipper does

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.470
are the elements of
what the tsar would

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.510
do to deal with climate.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.370
You slow down.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.220
Good plan.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.290
So you reduce emissions.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.840
You don't quite know
what the consequences

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.070
are of having more emissions
or of going faster.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.740
But you know they're
probably not good on balance.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.420
So you slow down.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.410
You prepare for
something to happen.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.930
You prepare to adapt.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.100
You learn.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.420
You station lookouts.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.590
You study the system.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.140
You see what's going on.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.610
You develop options, new
technologies, geoengineering,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.710
which I'll talk about briefly.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.920
And you try to figure
out a system that enables

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.690
learning to affect decisions.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.280
So you want to hear the lookouts
when they see something.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.560
So that's the sort
of thing the tsar

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.920
is going to have to do because
we don't know probabilities.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.442
We don't know, really,
models and studies

00:25:46.442 --> 00:25:48.650
of what's going to happen
to the Greenland ice sheet.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.840
But we don't know for sure.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.245
We don't know for sure.

00:25:53.245 --> 00:25:54.870
And we don't know
for sure whether it's

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.685
going to get wetter
or drier in Ethiopia.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.830
So just a word about
adaptation, the tsar

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.250
will have to have
to do some of this.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.020
But as I said, the small scale--

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.170
and we will adapt.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.260
That first line is one
of my favorite statements

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.560
about adaptation, which is,
the default mode of adaptation

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.290
is suffering.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.400
So we'll adapt.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.720
But the question is, will
we actually do any changes?

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.430
Will we do any
proactive adaptation?

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.790
As I said, problem one is that
the climate models differ.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.450
And I will give you an example.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.380
A colleague was called in by
the government of Ethiopia

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.440
some years ago.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.890
And they said, all
right, we believe there's

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.370
going to be climate change.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.040
What do we do?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.980
Half the climate models say
it's going to get drier.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.780
And half the climate models
say it's going to get wetter.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:27:00.410
How exactly do we prepare
for this uncertain future?

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.300
Their answer was pave the roads.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.960
Because if it's drier,
OK, you have paved roads.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.620
If it's wetter, a problem that
Ethiopia traditionally has

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.250
is that unpaved roads wash out
when there's heavy rainfall.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.610
And the whole process of getting
food to market breaks down.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.800
So if it gets wetter, you
will really need paved roads.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.170
And if it doesn't get
wetter, paved roads

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.853
are not a bad thing to have.

00:27:28.853 --> 00:27:30.520
There are going to
be a lot of decisions

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.310
like that, a lot of people
looking for robust policies.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.270
The second problem, of course,
is the tsar can't possibly

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.530
make all these decisions.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.270
They're going to be made
at state and local levels.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.640
A number of cities and states
have now, already in the US

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.860
and certainly foreign
countries, have now

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.790
processes in place to think
about this, to try to think

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.310
about things as Ethiopia did.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.900
What can we do that's robust?

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.150
If we're going to have sea level
rise, how do we cope with that?

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.920
What do we need to
do about hurricanes?

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.440
How do we change
various policies?

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.660
An awful lot of that is local.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.355
Awful lot of that
has to be local.

00:28:11.355 --> 00:28:15.260
An awful lot of that's going
to be in poor countries.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.230
So adaptation will happen.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.480
The tsar will try to do
something about that.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.240
But that, one hopes,
is not enough.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.430
No one doubts that will
be enough to really get us

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.690
smoothly.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.520
New technologies,
you guys are going

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.870
to develop new technologies.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.070
That's going to be terrific.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.060
What's the tsar going
to do about that?

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.590
Well, we'll come back
to some of these issues.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.630
But governments have
a terrible record

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.040
of pushing the development
of civilian technologies.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.440
Military technologies,
space technologies,

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.320
where cost doesn't matter, fine.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.510
Basic research, fine.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:55.580
Getting stuff to market at a
reasonable price, bad record.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.430
So you can't adapt.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.800
And you can't solve
it with technology.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.190
You got to reduce emissions.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.310
Why is reducing emissions hard?

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.160
Oh, well, let me
first fossil fuels.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.170
Another thing you might
think about doing,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.630
and you've probably read
about, is geoengineering.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.140
The simplest way to think about
that is artificial volcanoes.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.450
You might put sulfate.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.050
When Mount Pinatubo blew
up, as I understand it,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.670
there was a discernible cooling.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:36.680
Small particles, aerosols in the
stratosphere reflect sunlight.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:42.160
So why don't we just either burn
more coal or take the 16-inch

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.230
guns from battleships that
aren't in use anymore,

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.810
turn them up, and fire aerosols
into the stratosphere--

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.830
this is a serious proposal--
to reflect sunlight?

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.950
Well, you might want to have
that in your back pocket

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:55.730
for emergencies.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.240
But, first of all, if you have
more CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.650
the ocean becomes more acidic.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.150
And creatures die.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.590
Doesn't solve that problem.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.592
And second, if you
don't reduce emissions,

00:30:05.592 --> 00:30:07.550
you've got to keep doing
more and more of that.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.540
And that does not sound like
a long-term way forward.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.930
So CO2 is where
the policy focus is

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.120
because, as we saw from
those earlier graphs,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.600
it's quite important.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.840
It lasts a long time.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.110
We can measure fossil
fuel use pretty easily.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.110
Think about countries
that import all their oil.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.830
You can measure
imports pretty easily

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.800
at the ports where they happen.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.160
You may be wrong, plus or
minus inventory accumulation.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.110
But it's not easy
to carry and not

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.500
cheap to carry inventories of
crude oil and refined product.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.270
So in terms of internationally
enforceable agreements,

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.620
fossil fuel is pretty easy
compared to anything else

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.230
you want to think about.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:01.000
Another reason you focus on it
is we talked about last week.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.110
Not only does it
involve durable assets

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.100
that can last a long
time, that are expensive,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.950
and, thus, expensive
to replace early,

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.170
but there are all these
other path dependencies

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.360
that keep you down a path.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.610
So that if you want to--
so the energy system

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.640
is a slow ship to turn.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.580
And if you need to turn
it because its impact last

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.910
100 years and if you
can turn it because you

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.840
can monitor and enforce, that's
a logical place to focus.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.790
Why is that problem hard?

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.985
Why is it hard to
change emissions?

00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:42.110
Well, we talked about that.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:47.300
This is some color-coded,
not very well color-coded

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.770
emissions trajectories
on the left matched

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.340
with atmospheric CO2
concentrations on the right

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.840
and matched down here, except
for the really aggressive

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:05.480
reduction scenario, matched
with temperature increases.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.290
So the world runs on fossil
fuels to a first approximation.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:15.530
You saw all those
Lawrence Livermore graphs

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.370
of sources of energy.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.170
Most of it's fossil.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.480
The world runs on fossil fuels.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.610
Big emission cuts
are needed if you're

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.110
going to reduce temperature.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.460
Take the you might think
of the orange kind of as

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.870
an estimate of business as usual
maybe, somebody's estimate.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.050
The blue then is a
pretty aggressive cut.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.950
But look what and the blue
relative to the orange,

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.230
at the end of the century,
has a pretty big impact

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.870
on atmospheric concentrations.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.140
But the temperature
still goes up.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.340
The temperature still
goes up substantially.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.815
That's a two-degree or is
that a three-degree increase

00:32:56.815 --> 00:32:57.440
in temperature?

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.950
Three degrees Fahrenheit
increase in temperature.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.110
The orange, much bigger.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.540
But that's a big
change, right, if you're

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.160
going from here to here?

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.770
China's not getting rich
burning coal on the blue path.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:18.450
We're not increasing our
energy at all probably.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.340
Europe is cutting
back even farther

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.960
to get to that blue path.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.190
That's a big deal.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.720
So if it's the
easiest thing to do

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.750
and it's an important thing
to do, it's a big deal.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.810
So that's one reason
why it's hard is

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.860
we live on fossil fuels.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.910
So if you're going to cut
the use of fossil fuels,

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.140
emissions from fossil fuels--

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.800
it's emissions
from fossil fuels--

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.240
you could do some
fuel switching.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.460
You can do some efficiency.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.210
You can do some this,
that, and the other.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.330
But you will have to do a lot.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.110
New technologies
will be essential.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.080
But they may or may
not appear in time.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.220
OK, so that's a big deal.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.610
So we all go to bicycles.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.440
That's great.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.690
We can do that.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:04.890
We can emulate the Dutch.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.179
And we can all bicycle to work.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.305
But we're not the problem.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.710
Any projection of the future
says the growth in emissions

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.590
will come from countries
that are now poor.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.150
They have been
growing more rapidly

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.489
than countries that are
now rich for some time.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:26.560
And all projections are
they will continue to do so.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.790
So this is from
BP's energy outlook.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:35.280
If you look up to 2010,
it's 1990 to 2010,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.170
you'll see OECD emissions, rich
country emissions, pretty flat.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:45.760
I mean, they'd be up a bit but
for the recession but not much.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.110
But dramatic growth in
the less rich countries,

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.429
dramatic growth.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:55.940
Again, for the world as
a whole, energy and CO2

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.060
have grown less
rapidly than GDP.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:04.700
That declining we saw in the
US is a general phenomenon.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:12.140
But if you try to
control global emissions,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.340
try to reduce global emissions
by reducing OECD emissions,

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:24.370
you see if we go to zero by
2030 and the non-OECD proceeds

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:30.670
on the track, global emissions
will be up, just by eye.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.810
So yeah, Sam?

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.550
AUDIENCE: It says that's as soon
as [INAUDIBLE] policy changes.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.990
Any idea what those could be?

00:35:39.962 --> 00:35:41.670
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You read the report,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:45.030
and you say, well,
what are they assuming?

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.120
They're assuming tightening
restrictions in Europe.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.430
They're assuming
something in the US.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:54.270
They're assuming continued
efficiency increases.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.950
They're not assuming the
kind of global agreement

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.180
you guys are going to
negotiate Wednesday and Friday.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:00.990
That's clear.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.550
They're not assuming a
second Kyoto Protocol

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.980
ratified by the whole world.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.070
I think, and it's an
interesting assumption

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.480
to assume that, absent anything
going on in these countries,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.220
that these countries
will continue.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.950
I mean, here, they're showing a
reduction, a positive reduction

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.300
in emissions here
over that period.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.020
So that is-- and there's
growth, not huge growth.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.560
But there's growth.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.310
So they're assuming a
tightening in the OECD,

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.830
continued efficiency
increases here.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.990
There's some discussion of
China becoming a bit less carbon

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.500
intensive.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.930
But the main policy
action's here.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.424
And they do not assume
a global agreement.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.680
It's a short description.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.980
I invite you to read it.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.200
It's about two pages.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.560
See what you think
they assume, but that's

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.670
what I get out of it.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.610
You can see they're continuing
to assume for the world,

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:03.200
as a whole, efficiency
increases, right?

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.920
The GDP grows much more
rapidly than energy use.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.290
And they're continuing
to assume for the world,

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:13.890
as a whole, decarbonization,
presumably, presumably

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.890
a switch out of coal into
natural gas and renewables.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.770
I'd have to go back
and check, but I think

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.476
that's part of the scenario.

00:37:21.476 --> 00:37:22.190
Anything else?

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.690
Yeah?

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:26.640
AUDIENCE: How big is the impact
on emissions, like methane?

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.750
I know that it keeps more heat.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.300
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Methane has a--

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.460
the reason for not
focusing on methane,

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:42.010
even though it is a more
potent heat-trapping gas,

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.810
it doesn't stay in the
atmosphere as long,

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:49.060
A. So it's about 10 year half
life, ballpark, about 10 years.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.400
And, B, it's harder to figure.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.120
It has many sources.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.140
So it's got natural gas leaks.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.680
It's got landfill decomposition.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.270
It's got things rotting.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.540
So it's harder to control.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:10.870
And in fact, in 20 years,
30 years, less serious.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.440
Yeah?

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.800
Please.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.250
SUSAN SOLOMON: I think part
of the confusion on methane

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.640
is that, although every
molecule of methane

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.390
is more potent than
a molecule of CO2,

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.590
there is a lot more
CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:24.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.590
SUSAN SOLOMON: So
actually, CO2 is

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.870
doing three times
more warming right

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.475
now than the total
of all methane

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:33.100
because there's so
much more out there.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.860
Even though heat-trapping
molecules are stronger there.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.360
OK?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, I didn't do that.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.380
SUSAN SOLOMON: So it's
not the main thing.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.480
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, I didn't do that.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.200
I should have done it.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.310
SUSAN SOLOMON: This
is the main thing.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.102
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I should have done it.

00:38:44.102 --> 00:38:49.720
Yeah, if you break down sources
of anthropogenic warming,

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.420
CO2 dominates.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.962
SUSAN SOLOMON: When people get
to talking about methane being

00:38:53.962 --> 00:38:56.730
an effective greenhouse gas,
it can get very confusing

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:57.267
for people.

00:38:57.267 --> 00:38:58.350
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:58.850
Yeah?

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.590
AUDIENCE: So the point is the
graph is built on CO2 emissions

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:05.408
by the OECD countries and
non-OECD countries, right?

00:39:05.408 --> 00:39:06.450
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yep.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.950
AUDIENCE: But in
general population,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.202
I think the OECD countries--

00:39:09.202 --> 00:39:11.160
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
We're going to come there.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.660
We're going to break it down.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.990
Yes, you are.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:19.410
In terms of per capita, the
OECD countries are much higher.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.690
But the only point
to be made here

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.920
is, if you want this
top graph to come down,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.230
you're not going
to get it all here.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:34.950
And you got to do something
up here somehow, somehow.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.350
We will come to questions
of fairness in about a half

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.230
a second.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:43.680
So that's a reason.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.620
You're going to have
to deal with growth.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.120
And the growth is going to come
from countries that are now

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.340
poorer than the OECD countries.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.030
The other reason,
let me just briefly

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.980
do a little economics
here as opposed

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.950
to a little pseudo-science.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:08.070
Suppose you want to
reduce emissions.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:11.820
Say you want a total
reduction in emissions

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.540
from business as
usual of capital R.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.160
And you want to do it worldwide.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.070
And the cost of getting
reductions in country I

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.620
is given by this cost function.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.560
All right, so the tsar
cares about global cost.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.910
So what the tsar is going
to do is reduce emissions.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.330
He's going to minimize
the total cost

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.940
subject to this constraint.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.820
And if you recall or
just use your intuition,

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.730
you're going to have to have the
marginal cost, the derivative

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.280
of this function with
respect to its argument

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.010
equal across countries.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:53.330
If not, I can
rearrange reductions

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.280
in a way that will lower costs.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.470
I'll do a little more
where marginal cost is

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.780
low and a little less where
marginal cost is high.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.240
Get the same
reductions, lower cost.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.050
That's always true unless
the marginal costs are equal.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.510
Well, if marginal
costs are going

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:14.990
to be equal, then unless it's
really hard to reduce emissions

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.450
in poor countries, they
have to play if we're

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.850
going to reduce total cost.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:23.150
It's not a question
of who pays for it.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.700
It's a question of
where it happens, right?

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.050
Doesn't say that that Bangladesh
has to pay to reduce emissions

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.340
in Bangladesh.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.070
It says that emissions
in Bangladesh

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.620
will have to be reduced.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.380
So they're separate questions.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.450
But it says the poor
will need to be involved.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.450
If you recall 1401, if
you have a firm producing

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:55.190
in multiple plants, this is
exactly the same principle.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.935
You want to equalize
on the margin.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.730
Normally, it means
everybody has to play.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.440
There are two
approaches that have

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.940
been put on the table for this.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.330
And we'll come back
to both of them.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.150
The Parsons, et al,
piece on the reading

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:18.800
list, which is optional,
talks about one of them.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.720
You could say, all right,
how about the tsar says

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.570
there's a price of
$20 a ton for carbon

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.150
emissions from fossil fuels?

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:37.010
The tsar doesn't like
to do central planning.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.200
He's learned that lesson.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.880
But the tsar can
tinker with prices.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.690
So he'll put a price of
$20 a ton for emissions.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:49.860
Well, that means everybody
who's contemplating emissions

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:54.330
is going to cut back until
the cost of cutting back rises

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.410
to $20.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:01.700
And I'll get this marginal
cost of quality that way.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.670
All right, so I'll
just price the thing.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.060
We talked about this earlier.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.100
This is pricing the harm.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.050
So I priced the harm.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.840
People cut back on the harm.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.740
It's a tax.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:16.420
It'll show up as a tax, probably
show up as a tax on fuel.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.823
Tax much higher on coal
than on natural gas.

00:43:18.823 --> 00:43:19.990
But that's one way to do it.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.000
And the tsar can do that.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.820
The other way to do it--

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.820
that makes sense, right?

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.890
That's easy?

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:28.890
We just price the thing.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.077
The other way to do it is a
little more convoluted but only

00:43:35.077 --> 00:43:35.660
a little more.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.118
And we'll return
to the equivalence

00:43:37.118 --> 00:43:44.370
later on is the tsar prints
up certificates, drops

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:51.380
from helicopters, and
says, to emit a ton of CO2,

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.560
you have to give
me a certificate.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.580
Limited number of certificates
equal to the total amount

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:04.670
of CO2 the tsar wants to
permit, you get a market, right?

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.410
I go around looking
for certificates.

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.040
I'm willing to pay
20 bucks for it.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.260
I'm willing to pay some price.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.630
The market will
determine what price.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.570
In this case, if I fix
a price, the market

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.760
will determine the quantity.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.480
If I fix a quantity, the market
will determine the price.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.850
But I can go either way.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.430
And if the tsar
knows all, it doesn't

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.040
matter which way he goes.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.930
We'll talk a little
later, I think,

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.060
about when and where
and how it might matter.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:39.796
But that's what the
tsar might want to do.

00:44:39.796 --> 00:44:43.630
But do those make sort
of top of the head sense

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:50.130
as a way to do it without having
to do central planning for all

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.900
the nations of the world?

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.060
But if you say it's
$30 a ton or $40 a ton

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:02.040
for everybody and poor
countries have to pay it,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.030
how do they do that?

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.770
How do they do that?

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:11.900
So you know that they're going
to have to do some reduction.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:17.080
Because if you think
about it, they're

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.590
building buildings,
facilities, et cetera.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:24.980
It's a lot cheaper to
insulate a new house

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:31.160
when it's being built than to go
back and retrofit an old house.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.220
It's a lot cheaper to make
a new power plant efficient

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.660
than to repower an
old power plant.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.020
So if the poorer
countries of the world

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.960
are growing more
rapidly, they have

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.050
a lot more relatively
inexpensive investment

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.920
opportunities.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.800
They also may not have
built Los Angeles yet.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.830
So they're in a position
to decide more easily

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.520
on a different urban
structure, less spread out,

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.930
less reliant on cars.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:05.280
So there are a set of
choices that are being made.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.740
There are also, if you
look at retrofit options,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:14.760
there's a lot of energy use
now that is polluting as well

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.230
as inefficient.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:22.470
So modernizing some
of the plants now

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.780
will create a double benefit.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.780
If you can do something besides
little kerosene generators,

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.330
for instance, for electricity
in a lot of places,

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:35.110
you will not only save
energy, but you clean the air.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.890
So there's a benefit
to be had in bringing

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:46.420
these countries closer to the
frontier with what they already

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.750
have.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:48.250
OK.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:56.630
So this is a hard
problem for the tsar.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:00.620
The tsar has to figure
out how she's going to--

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.270
or the tsarina, how
she's going to deal

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:07.560
with the distant future and
great-great-grandchildren,

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.450
how to deal with
uncertainty today

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:17.730
and to learn to deal with a
tomorrow as learning happens.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.210
The tsar is going to have to
figure out what, if anything,

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.120
could be done about
technologies, how to get people

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.300
and able to adapt.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.990
If the tsar focuses
on fossil fuel,

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:33.810
the tsar has to
make big changes.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:37.420
And the tsar has to
involve the poor.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.250
The tsar has to
involve the poor.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.070
It can't be done
by rich countries.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.060
If rich countries
alone try to do it,

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:48.400
if you go back to something like
this, you want to slow growth.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.890
You want to eliminate
growth in emissions

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:53.290
by only the rich
countries, they'd

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.120
have to go to zero
to have a big impact.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.650
It isn't going to happen.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:01.320
So the pole need to be involved.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.930
And the first question that
comes up, already came up,

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:07.615
is that fair?

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.090
This is emissions per capita.

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:18.500
This is Annex II North
America is US and Canada.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.620
This is Australia,
New Zealand, Japan.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:26.100
EIT, or Economies In
Transition, that's

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.200
Russia and Eastern Europe.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.790
There's the Middle East.

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:33.900
Annex II Europe or rich
European countries,

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.755
China, other countries, Latin
America, the rest of Asia,

00:48:37.755 --> 00:48:38.255
Africa.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.710
Is it fair to involve them?

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.360
My golly.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.520
You're going to go to Cambodia.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.060
You remember I put up the
Cambodia energy diagram

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.260
some while ago.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.390
Cambodia imports some oil
and burns a lot of wood.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:59.670
That's the energy system.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.020
And they mostly ride motorbikes.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.350
And you can't get them
much smaller than the ones

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:09.090
they have.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:14.870
So this is an enormous
disparity, right?

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.300
North America is running--

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.320
I don't know--

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.970
16 metric tons per capita.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:23.200
Africa is running less than one.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:23.980
Big disparity.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:24.910
Huge disparity.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:25.930
Very different.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.250
Very different systems.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.590
So if you're going
to change, you're

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.030
going to look
people in the face.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.640
And those of you who want
to be developing countries

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.550
or developed countries
on Wednesday and Friday

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:39.970
are going to look your poor
brethren in the face and say,

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.300
you, Latin America,
rest of Asia, Africa,

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.560
boy, you've got to take steps.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.930
We'll do what we can.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.580
But you've got to take steps.

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.760
Say, we have path
dependence up here.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.315
We're kind of stuck on a path.

00:49:54.315 --> 00:49:55.940
And you know, what
are you going to do?

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:04.400
So fairness is also in one
response might be, yeah, well,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.280
let's look not per capita.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.457
But you're low because
you're really, really poor.

00:50:12.457 --> 00:50:14.040
And we're really,
really sad about it.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:19.890
But per dollar of GDP, the
differences are less stark.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:24.120
The winners now are the
Middle East, Soviet Union,

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.990
and Eastern Europe
because those were really

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.570
manufacturing-intensive
technologies.

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:34.220
They ran on cheap
Russian oil, which

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:38.360
was made available at low
cost, and Russian natural gas.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.090
They still have an anomalous
amount of inefficient capital

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.240
stock running.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.240
And China, which has a
manufacturing-intensive economy

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.350
and uses a lot of coal.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.120
So per unit of GDP, Africa is
right in there with everybody

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.320
else.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.960
They just happen to have
not much GDP per capita.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.850
So you say, well, per dollar
of GDP, we can make cuts.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.480
You can make cuts.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.530
And one response might be, yeah,
but we'd like our GDP to grow.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.510
Thank you very much.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:18.720
So this is another nice example.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.930
This is if you do
the cumulative,

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:25.460
you do what's in the air,
which was the point Professor

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.020
Solomon was making, if
you do what's in the air,

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.030
this is just CO2.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:32.240
But it shows,
cumulatively, what's

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:37.837
in the air now based on a model
of the carbon cycle, what's

00:51:37.837 --> 00:51:39.420
in the air now and
where it came from.

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.570
Blue is the rich countries.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.940
This is kind of middle
income developing countries.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.750
And that's the very poor.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:55.860
So in terms of who
caused the problem, who

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.560
put the stuff in the
air, it's not China.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.540
Who's putting it in the
air and who's growing?

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.260
Yeah.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.340
But who put it there?

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.850
It's us.

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:06.350
OK.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.980
A little bit of sort of how
the international conversation

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:21.680
on all of this has gone,
just by way of background,

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.430
and then we'll see
what questions you have

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:27.360
because I've gone through
this much too rapidly.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.320
As I mentioned, the Framework
Convention on Climate Change

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:38.050
was drafted in 1992,
ratified by everybody.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:41.350
There have been 17 conferences
of the parties referred

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:46.690
to as COPs, large
gatherings of diplomats,

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:53.410
nongovernmental organizations,
demonstrators, hangers on,

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:56.500
cocktail parties, receptions.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.720
There have been 17 of them.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.740
You will be the 18th.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.880
The third produced
the Kyoto Protocol.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.230
The Framework Convention
divided the world

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:14.530
into Annex I countries
and everybody else.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.680
Annex II, which was on some
of those earlier graphs,

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.560
is a subset of Annex I. It's
the richer Annex I countries.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:32.200
The Kyoto Protocol called
for Annex I countries only.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.480
And by the way, it's
not all rich countries.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.140
South Korea is not
Annex I. Singapore

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.680
is not Annex I. Saudi Arabia
is not Annex I and so forth.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.433
So it's industrialized
countries.

00:53:45.433 --> 00:53:49.250
OECD, roughly, OECD.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:53.540
Annex I countries were
to make reductions that

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.640
were negotiated reductions.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.640
The rest of the
world, which I just

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.270
said has to participate if
something's going to happen,

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:07.180
refused to even promise
making promises in the future.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.450
So there wasn't
even a commitment

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.340
to make a commitment.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.210
They would not commit to commit.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:18.120
And if you think about that,
that's really resisting.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.890
We'll be happy to come
to these meetings.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:24.060
But we do not now promise
ever to commit to do anything,

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.960
unless, of course,
it's paid for.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.450
So the Kyoto Protocol
called for Annex I countries

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:32.310
to make reductions.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:39.760
It was ratified by the members
of the European Union, Japan,

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.980
Australia, Canada,
lots of other folks.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.620
We did not.

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:51.720
The history of that is roughly
that President Clinton,

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.530
in the run up to
those negotiations,

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.410
there was a lot of noise
in the air about how

00:54:58.410 --> 00:54:59.220
this will be free.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.813
It'll be a great benefit
to the US economy.

00:55:01.813 --> 00:55:02.730
This will be fabulous.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:03.730
We can reduce emissions.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:05.100
It'll be no cost.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.688
Every economist not working
for the administration stood up

00:55:08.688 --> 00:55:10.980
and said, well, it's not
going to cost that much money,

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.570
but it will cost.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:17.170
Congress passed a resolution
95 to nothing saying,

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.970
we won't ratify anything that--

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.100
basically, slightly
different language--

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.980
that doesn't require the
Chinese to do something now.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.970
95 to nothing.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:28.570
So Al Gore went to Kyoto.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:32.680
The US said, this is fabulous.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.910
We made an agreement.

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:38.690
The treaty was not sent to
the Senate for ratification.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:42.820
And President George
W. Bush formally

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.330
declared the horse dead
in 2001 when he said,

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.470
we're not going to play.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.190
So the EU has
established-- and again,

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:54.460
you can read the Parsons, et
al, article if you're interested

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.210
in it--

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:57.130
established an emissions
trading scheme.

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:01.000
They did the certificates
dropped from the air that

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.100
lets you emit carbon dioxide.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.840
I mean, it's not
a perfect system.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.150
You'll see some glitches.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.760
But it may work.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.910
And they may actually
meet their commitments.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.740
It doesn't appear
anybody else will,

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.440
even those that
ratified the treaty.

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.450
Australia's walking away.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.700
I think Canada has walked away.

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.230
Japan may because of
the incredible disaster

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:33.830
they've gone through but
would not have absent it

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:36.710
and may not since they now
say that they will replace

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:38.990
the nuclear plants with coal.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:40.220
So we'll see.

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:47.290
But at any rate,
nothing will happen.

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:51.550
The subsequent
agreements, there was

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:55.540
Copenhagen. There was a lot of
fuss around Copenhagen. You'll

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:59.800
see the run up discussed
in The Economist reading.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.280
You will see the most
recent Doha discussed

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.110
in the second very
short Economist

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.120
reading, happened in December.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.110
There's no global
agreement in place.

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:19.673
What happened in Doha, and it's
on my slides for Wednesday,

00:57:19.673 --> 00:57:20.590
but I'll tell you now.

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:24.160
What happened in
Doha was basically

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.960
the Europeans
agreed to continue.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.890
There was a promise of money
to go from the rich countries

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:34.080
to the poor countries,
a much smaller promise

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.460
than you will consider
Wednesday and Friday.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.160
But there was a promise.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.830
We'll see if it's kept.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:45.230
And the developing
world promised

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:48.080
to consider making promises.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.780
That is to say the
refusal to commit ever

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.910
to commit is off the table.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:56.750
They now say they will consider,
in subsequent negotiations

00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:03.220
beginning in 2015,
participating in a global regime

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:08.180
of some sort, not
fully spelled out.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.330
So the poor countries,
as I say, need

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:16.830
to participate, have managed
to be excluded so far.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:24.410
The task you will face on
Wednesday and Friday is to,

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:27.920
and I hope do it
with a straight face,

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.370
is to make proposals that have
some hope of being accepted

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:35.270
when you go back to your
capitals of emissions

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.040
reductions that will get
the job done globally.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.340
OK, I've covered a lot.

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.480
And I'm going to pause here.

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.330
I hate to quit this early.

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:48.510
But let me see if you have
questions or comments.

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:49.790
How do we do this?

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.140
Have you all read the
briefing materials?

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:56.640
No?

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.510
They're up for
Wednesday, I guess.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:59.010
Yeah?

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:05.982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
$1 billion per year

00:59:05.982 --> 00:59:10.065
to stay within that 2
degrees Celsius rise?

00:59:10.065 --> 00:59:11.690
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
2 degrees Celsius,

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:13.648
which is what we're
working with because that's

00:59:13.648 --> 00:59:20.350
how the exercise was set, is
really ambitious at this stage.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.110
I mean, it is the
goal that was adopted

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:28.730
in Copenhagen. It's a very
ambitious goal at this stage.

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.170
It might not have been so
ambitious 20 years ago.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.410
But now more stuff in the air.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:35.760
Stuff going to stay a long time.

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.680
Steeper reduction is called for.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.720
Yeah, I mean, who knows
what it's going to take?

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.960
But it's not going to
be a walk in the part.

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.642
It's going to be serious money.

00:59:44.642 --> 00:59:47.142
AUDIENCE: I thought that was
interesting because $1 trillion

00:59:47.142 --> 00:59:50.425
is less than a percent of
the entire world's GDP.

00:59:50.425 --> 00:59:51.550
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It is.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.120
It is.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.260
But as they say in Washington,
you've got only 100

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.350
of those percents to play with.

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:05.900
And so less than 1% sounds
small until you start saying,

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.010
what does that mean we don't do?

01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:10.580
1% of the household
budget, easy.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:18.440
But 1% of-- moving 1% of world
GDP from purpose A to purpose B

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.620
requires governments
to do serious things.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.703
Deciding to cut
back 1% yourself,

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:24.620
yeah, you can do that.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.730
It's nothing.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.750
But deciding that US is going to
increase spending on something

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.650
by 1%, A, that's a
bigger percentage

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.600
of government activity.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.650
And, B, you're going to
have to tax, spend, torque,

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:43.190
regulate, do significant things.

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.830
So yeah, it's only 1% of GDP.

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:48.350
And all the models
say that's sort

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.110
of the right order of magnitude
for the kinds of things you'll

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:55.670
need to do, 1%, maybe 2%.

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:59.450
But that sounds
easier than it is.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:01.930
Let me just say that.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:02.488
Yeah, David?

01:01:02.488 --> 01:01:04.530
AUDIENCE: You're talking
about the Kyoto Protocol

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.570
and how basically the
EU is the only one

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:08.880
who even had a chance of
meeting what they promised.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.840
What's been proposed to kind
make sure that people actually

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.130
meet what they said?

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:17.340
So say, I'm the EU and I
spent all this money trying

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.433
to control our CO2 emissions.

01:01:19.433 --> 01:01:20.100
We did our part.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:20.962
And no one else did.

01:01:20.962 --> 01:01:22.920
And it's really not going
to make a difference.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, there's

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.490
no enforcement mechanism
in the protocol.

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:31.560
I don't know that the
Framework Convention even

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.140
allows for the possibility
of an enforcement mechanism.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.370
I'd have to go back and look.

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:41.320
For simple international
agreements ,

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.330
it hasn't mattered much.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:47.890
The Montreal Protocol to phase
out ozone-depleting substances,

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:51.950
widely ratified not perfect.

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:55.030
There are some illegal
manufacturing here and there.

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:58.210
But basically, it's tiny.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:01.540
So most governments can
afford to just do it.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.640
Most countries can
afford to do it.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.430
It's a rich countries
use those chemicals more

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:09.430
than poor countries.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.710
Rich countries can
afford substitutes,

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.740
not perfect, but cheap.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.580
This, not so cheap.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.550
And so no enforcement mechanism
there either, as far as I know.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:19.870
I don't think there was.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:23.740
In any case, it was
never seriously deployed.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.290
Here, what would you do?

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:30.740
I mean, the Europeans
are ready to go.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.000
Everybody was very excited.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.810
Al Gore flew to Kyoto.

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:35.900
It was high times.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:41.510
And to say the US has always
talked about monitoring.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:43.580
No matter who the
president's been,

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:49.250
we always talk about monitoring
in these kinds of discussions.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.320
Nobody listens to us much now.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.270
But we always say,
gee, you ought

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:59.390
to actually know if somebody
is obeying the agreement.

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:03.650
That's resisted by
a lot of countries.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.760
So no.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.880
And you can now
imagine the beginnings

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.237
of a European reaction.

01:03:10.237 --> 01:03:10.820
Wait a minute.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.710
We're doing all this?

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.380
And what are all these
other people doing?

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.580
They're smiling at us.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.310
It raises the cost of
our heavy industry,

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:24.500
our energy-intensive industry.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.450
And wait a minute.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.400
Why are we doing this again?

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.010
Because it's not going to
have any effect, right?

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:33.170
I mean, Europe is a relatively--

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:36.140
relative to those
big charts, the kind

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.240
of reductions that
Europe's making

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.180
are hard to see
on the aggregate.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.110
If I go back to--

01:03:46.245 --> 01:03:46.870
that's the one.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:51.990
If I go back to this one,
Europe might be the width

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:57.060
of this down at some cost.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.280
So you can imagine
the European public

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.930
being less and less excited just
as they've begun to phase down

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:05.610
subsidies for renewable energy.

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:11.580
So yeah, that's
part of the problem.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.380
The tsar can enforce.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.300
We do not have a tsar.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.788
We do not have a tsar.

01:04:16.788 --> 01:04:18.580
AUDIENCE: So the Senate
passed a resolution

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.997
saying they won't
approve anything

01:04:19.997 --> 01:04:23.790
that doesn't force China to
also have emissions reductions?

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Didn't say force.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:30.120
You can't use force because
none of these agreements--

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.090
unless it requires,
which is to say

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:36.490
that China signs on to something
that says it will do x.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:36.990
Yeah.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:38.740
AUDIENCE: But it doesn't
specify that they

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.132
have to actually be monitored?

01:04:41.132 --> 01:04:42.840
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, I can't imagine.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.710
I This country's
got a long history

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:48.483
of strategic arms reduction.

01:04:48.483 --> 01:04:50.400
Do you remember-- well,
you wouldn't remember.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.500
But you may have heard
people say trust but verify.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.080
We've always had that
view internationally.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.940
We want to make sure
if we're going to obey,

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.920
we're going to make sure
other people do too,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.510
at least monitor.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.050
You may not be able to enforce.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:07.460
So I can't see us signing
something, ratifying

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:11.720
something that doesn't have at
least monitoring provisions.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:19.290
Enforcement, look at attempts
to take action against Syria.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:23.000
The world community doesn't
lightly enforce stuff.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.390
But every so often, Syria,
Iran, something gets done.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.578
But doesn't get done easily.

01:05:28.578 --> 01:05:29.870
Doesn't get done automatically.

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.130
It's a big political deal.

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.820
David?

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.310
AUDIENCE: How is this not led
to a stronger partnership laws?

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:40.400
In that, I see it as a place
where a more developed nation

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.770
that has high technology
institutions like MIT

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:46.160
could come in and talk
to a place like that.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.115
There's already a fair amount
of infrastructure investment

01:05:49.115 --> 01:05:49.880
that's made.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.610
And a lot of it can be in the
terms of low-interest loans

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:56.720
or provide experts to help
build up the infrastructure

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.380
because your cost is lower.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.020
And you're developing
something new.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.560
And you're fostering global
investment here in the States

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.180
by making that part of your--

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:05.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Available.

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:06.500
AUDIENCE: --value add.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.595
You're also helping
internationally.

01:06:07.595 --> 01:06:08.678
How is that not happening?

01:06:08.678 --> 01:06:11.060
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
it happens to some extent.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:15.170
There's a problem of
measurement, right?

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:20.680
The European system--
the Kyoto Protocol

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:27.220
provides for joint
implementation.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.330
Well, I forget the
exact language.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:29.830
Hmm?

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.740
The Clean Development
Mechanism, CDM.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.700
If you're a European
company, you

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.240
can meet some of
your obligations

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.450
by reducing emissions
in a poor country.

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:51.230
So you can go to China and do a
deal, bring in new technology,

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:54.890
do something that
will reduce emissions.

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:56.140
And that will give you credit.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.950
And that's exactly
that kind of thinking.

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.770
Even though China
isn't participating,

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.300
it's still cheaper to
do reductions there.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:09.310
So let's find a way to give
countries in Europe credit

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:11.888
for reductions in China.

01:07:11.888 --> 01:07:13.180
There are a couple of problems.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.500
Well, it all boils
down to one problem

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.920
really, which is, how
do you measure it?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.270
Because you're reducing
over what would have been.

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:29.850
So you modernize a factory.

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:32.040
So would that factory
have been running forever

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.360
with old technology?

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.920
Or would it have been torn down?

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.500
Or would it have been
modernized anyway?

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:43.390
So either you're real
light on how you do this,

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:46.690
and you don't impose
real tough restrictions

01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:49.210
and then you're not
getting real reductions.

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:51.880
Or you make it really
hard to document.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.770
In which case, you
kill the market.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.180
So it happens.

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.560
And it happens to some extent.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.518
The Europeans have gotten
a little tired of it,

01:07:58.518 --> 01:08:01.850
as I recall, thinking that
it's been a little too easy.

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:08.960
But one of the features of the
Waxman-Markey bill in the US,

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.200
which was the cap and trade
bill-- it was killed--

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.385
it allowed for that.

01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:18.990
It covered only fossil fuels.

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:22.470
But it allowed
companies to get credit

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:26.100
for things done in agriculture.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.490
So you could change land use.

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:33.710
And it was a giveaway
to agriculture

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.680
basically because the standards
were going to be pretty easy.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.229
But it was that
same notion that I

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:42.920
want to reach out beyond
places that I can price

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.620
to give people incentives.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:49.399
But it's really hard because
you can measure what is emitted.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:54.020
You can never measure
what would have been.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.840
You could see the same
problem with forests

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.700
if you think for just a minute.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.663
If I pay you not to
cut down a forest,

01:09:00.663 --> 01:09:02.330
does that mean the
guy across the street

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:07.310
cuts his down to provide
the timber or what?

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:11.300
And you would never have cut
it down or you would have?

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.109
So it's a natural model.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:19.880
If there were a common regime,
a cap and trade or a tax regime,

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.520
that would happen
automatically, easily.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.529
And you wouldn't have
a measurement problem.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:27.109
It's just hard to do it
without such a thing.

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:30.319
US companies, there's some
sort of informal trading

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.550
in carbon credits in the.

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:35.479
US and companies will
do stuff like this

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:37.340
and take credit for it.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.899
Perfectly fine activities.

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:42.326
It's socially
responsible and all that.

01:09:42.326 --> 01:09:43.534
But it's just hard to assess.

01:09:43.534 --> 01:09:46.531
AUDIENCE: Where's the
developing nation resistance?

01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:50.190
They're getting investment,
why would they not want to?

01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:51.990
Besides the
measurement problem, I

01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:53.930
would see it as someone
who's trying to get

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:55.082
foreign investment anyway.

01:09:55.082 --> 01:09:59.240
And you take out full-page
ads in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.920
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, what they're

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.890
worried about is
you guys got rich.

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:04.797
We want to get rich.

01:10:04.797 --> 01:10:06.380
You guys got rich
burning fossil fuel.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.510
And you're telling us--

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:10.310
I assume I'm going to
hear a bunch of this

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:13.160
on Wednesday and Friday
from the developing world.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.220
You're telling us that
you got to do that.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.110
And you're now leaning on us.

01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:25.130
The fear isn't that
boatloads of investment

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.680
will come in and
modernize their factory.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.290
The fear is that you're going
to raise the price of fuel

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:32.150
to my poor people.

01:10:32.150 --> 01:10:35.900
A lot of these countries
subsidize fuel.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:39.380
And I don't want to
take the political heat

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:45.248
from something that
restricts my ability to grow.

01:10:45.248 --> 01:10:47.040
If you're telling me
that the Europeans are

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.457
going to come in and modernize
my factories, that's swell.

01:10:49.457 --> 01:10:50.670
I love it.

01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:52.650
If you're telling me
that I have to change

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:57.600
my policies in a way that
might slow growth and keep

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.690
my people poor, I'm
not real excited.

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:06.820
And you can say
I've been talking

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.700
about your grandchildren
and great-grandchildren.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.100
Well, I mean, if your
kids are starving today,

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.980
that's a pretty
abstract argument.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.630
That's real abstract.

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:26.920
So other comments, reactions,
questions, thoughts?

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.015
Oh, yeah?

01:11:28.015 --> 01:11:32.710
AUDIENCE: So mostly we've been
talking about greenhouse gases.

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:34.360
Is there any
international discussion

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.570
about other like
climate-changing courses,

01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:41.718
like the black carbon or other
like aerosols, or is that not?

01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:43.510
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Not that I'm aware of.

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.980
Is there some?

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.290
SUSAN SOLOMON: Yes.

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:45.720
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.247
Say.

01:11:46.247 --> 01:11:47.830
SUSAN SOLOMON: Well,
I mean, the State

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:52.770
Department, just a few weeks
ago, announced that we would--

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:55.740
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
they will capture you on--

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.420
you didn't sign a release
form, but never mind.

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.198
SUSAN SOLOMON: I release you.

01:12:00.198 --> 01:12:02.490
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
everyone is released out there

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:03.282
in television land.

01:12:03.282 --> 01:12:03.960
OK.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.460
SUSAN SOLOMON: Just
a few weeks ago,

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.950
the State Department announced
that we would be part of,

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:11.100
and I guess the
leader of, an effort

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.310
to try to reduce
emissions of soot

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.310
and other short-lived
gases, stuff

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:21.520
like methane and
tropospheric ozones as well.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.200
So that's a voluntary program.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.690
But there are movements
in that direction.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:29.790
And there is
actually quite a bit

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:37.890
of investment in providing
very much more efficient stoves

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:41.760
to people in very
poor countries,

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.160
so that they can avoid using
things like dung and coal

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.528
and stuff like that, which
generates an enormous amount

01:12:49.528 --> 01:12:50.070
of pollution.

01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:53.880
So it has both a health benefit
and an efficiency benefit.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.250
And it also cuts
carbon a little but.

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.650
But realistically,
the main motivation

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:01.380
is much more grounded in soot.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I mean,
one reason, not the main reason

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.250
necessarily, to be concerned
with black carbon emissions is

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.710
the effect on the reflectivity.

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.980
If you have a lot of sea
ice, ice tends to reflect.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.840
Black carbon tends to absorb.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.600
So it does matter for
climate, but it also

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.190
matters when you breathe.

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.930
There are lots of international
environmental treaties.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:28.700
Most don't have anything
to do with climate.

WEBVTT

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All right.
Let's get moving.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good morning.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Today, if everything works out,
we have some fun for you guys.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I hope it works out.
We'll see.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What I am going to do today is
a very major application of the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
frequency response and the
frequency domain analysis of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
circuits.
And this application area is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
called filters.
The area of filters often times

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
demands a full course or a
couple of full courses all by

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
itself.
And filters are incredibly

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
useful.
They're used in virtually every

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
electronic device in some form
or another.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
They're used in radio tuners.
We will show you a demo of that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
today.
They're also used in your cell

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
phones.
Every single cell phone has a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
set of filters.
So, for example,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
how do you pick a conversation?
You pick a conversation by

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
picking a certain frequency and
grabbing data from there.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They are also in wide area
network wireless transmitters.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Do we have an access point
here?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I don't see one,
but you've seen wireless access

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
points.
Again, there they have filters

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in them.
So, virtually every single

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
electronic device contains a
filter at some point or another.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And so, today we will look at
this major, major application of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
frequency domain analysis.
Before we get into that,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'd like to do a bit of review.
The readings for today

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
correspond to Chapter 14.4.2,
14.5 and 15.2 in the course

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
notes.
All right.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let's start with the review.
We looked at this circuit last

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Friday --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
-- where I said that for our
analysis, we are going to focus

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
on this small,
small region of the playground.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And what's special about this
region of our playground is that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I am going to focus on
sinusoidal inputs.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And, second,
I am going to focus on the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
steady state response.
How does the response look like

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
if I wait a long,
long time?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And then we said that the full
blown time domain analysis was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
hard.
This was, remember,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the agonizing approach?
And then I taught you the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
impedance approach in the last
lecture, which was blindingly

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
simple.
And, in that impedance

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
approach, what we said we would
do is --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I will apply the approach right
now and in seconds derive the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
result for you.
But the basic idea was we said

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
what we are going to do is
assume that we are going to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
apply inputs of the form Vi e to
the j omega t.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Wherever you see a capital and
a small, there is an implicate e

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to the j omega t next to it.
I'm not showing you that.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And what I showed last time,
and the class before that was

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
once you find out the amplitude
--

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Once you find out the
multiplier that multiplies e to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
the j omega t,
it's a complex number,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
you have all the information
you need.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And once you have this,
you can find out the time

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
domain response by simply taking
the modulus of that,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or the amplitude and the phase
of that to get the angle.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And that gives you the time
domain response.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So, our focus has been on these
quantities.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The impedance method says what
I am going to do is replace each

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
of these by impedances.
And then the corresponding

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
impedance model looks like this.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Instead of R,
I replace that with ZR.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And instead of the capacitor,
I am going to replace that with

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
ZC.
And this is my Vc.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
ZR is simply R and ZC was going
to be one divided by sC where s

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
was simply a shorthand notation
for j omega.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Based on this,
once I converted all my

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
elements into impedances,
I can go ahead and apply all

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
the good-old linear analysis
techniques.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I will discuss a bunch of them
today.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
As an example,
I could analyze this using my

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
simple voltage divider
relationship.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Vc is simply ZC divided by ZC
plus ZR times Vi.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And that, in turn,
is, well, let's say I divide

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
this by Vi so I can get the
response relation,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is ZC divided by ZC plus ZR.
And ZC I know to be one by j

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
omega C, plus R.
And multiplying throughout by j

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000
omega C, I get one divided by
one plus j omega CR.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's incredibly simple.
This is simply called the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
frequency response.
And it's a transfer function

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
representing the relationship
between the output complex

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
amplitude with the input.
We can also plot this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Notice that in our entire
analysis we have not only

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
assumed sinusoidal input,
but we're also saying that let

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
us look at this only in the
steady state.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, we will wait for time to be
really, really large,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and then look at the response.
And so, therefore,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
we will plot the response not
as a function of time,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but rather we are going to plot
the response as a function of

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
omega.
What we are going to say is I

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
am going to input a sinusoid and
my output is going to be some

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
other sinusoid.
And since I'm waiting for a

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
long time to look at the output,
time doesn't make sense

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
anymore.
Rather, my free variable is

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
going to be my frequency,
so I am going to change the

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
frequency of the input that I
apply.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And so, I am going to plot this
as a function of omega.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This represents a completely
complimentary view of circuits,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the time domain view and then
there is a frequency domain

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
view.
The frequency domain view says

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
how did this circuit behave as I
apply sinusoids of differing

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
frequencies?
I can plot that relationship in

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
a graph like this,
and this relationship is simply

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
given by a parameter edge the
transfer function,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
it's a function of omega.
And I can also plot the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
absolute value of that.
And let's take a look at what

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
it looks like.
So, I can look at functions

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
like this and very quickly plot
the response.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I am going to do a whole bunch
of plots just by staring at

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
circuits and staring at
expressions like this.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And you will see a number of
them today.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
First of all,
the way you plot these is look

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
for the values where omega is
very small and when omega is

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
very large.
When omega is very,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
very small this term goes away.
And so, for very small values

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
of omega the output is simply
one.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Vc by Vi is simply one.
This part goes away.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
What happens when omega is
very, very large?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
When omega is really large,
this part dominates,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
is much greater than one.
If I ignore one in relation to

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
this guy and take the absolute
value of that then I simply get

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
one divided by omega CR when
omega is very large.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So, when omega is very large,
I get a decay of the form one

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
over omega CR.
I know the value for small

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
omega, and it looks like this
for very large omega.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And, if you plot it out,
this is how it's going to look

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
like.
Let's stare at this form for a

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
little while longer.
And let's plot some properties

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
off it.
First of all,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you notice something else.
When omega CR equals one then,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
in other words,
when omega equals one by RC,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
notice that the output is given
by one plus j.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And the absolute value of that
is simply one divided the square

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
root of two.
So, in other words,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
when omega is one by RC --
When omega is one by CR then

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the output is one by square root
two times its value when omega

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is very, very small.
So, that is one little piece of

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
information.
If you look at the form of

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
this, I would like you to stare
at it for a few minutes and try

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
to understand what this
represents.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This says that for very low
frequencies the response is

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
virtually the same as the input
in amplitude.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
In other words,
if I apply some very low

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
frequency sinusoid of some
amplitude then the output

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
amplitude is going to be same as
that amplitude.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And that's a one.
Now, it also says when I apply

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
a very high frequency,
at very high frequencies it

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
decays.
So, this graph which says I am

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
going to pass low frequencies
without any attenuation,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
without hammering it,
but I am going to clobber high

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
frequencies and give you a very
low amplitude signal at the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
output but pass through,
almost without attenuation,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the input at low frequencies.
And so this is an example of

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
what is called a low pass filter
or LPF.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
What this is saying is that
this little circuit here acts

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
like a low pass filter.
It's a low pass filter because

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it passes low frequencies
without attenuation but kills

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
high frequencies.
If I take some music,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and you will do experiments
with this in lab.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
When is lab three?
People are doing lab three

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
right now, right?
Lab three is going on right now

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and early next week as well.
And, in lab three,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
you will play with looking at
the response to music of

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
different types of filters.
If apply some music here,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
you will see that the output
will pass low frequencies but

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
really attenuate high
frequencies.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You will hear a lot of the low
sounding base and so on but

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
attenuate a lot of the high
frequencies.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
All right.
The other thing that I

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
encourage you to do is Websim
has built in pages for a large

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
number of such circuits.
You can go in there and play

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
with the values of RC,
or L for that matter,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for a variety of circuits.
And, if you click on frequency

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
response, you actually get both
the amplitude response and the

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
phase as well.
You can play with various

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
values of RLC and see how the
frequency response looks like

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
for each of the circuits.
As a next step,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
what I would like to do is just
give you a sense of how

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
impedances combine.
This won't be very surprising

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
given that they behave just like
resistors, but it's good to go

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
through it nonetheless.
Suppose, just to build some

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
insight, suppose I had two
resistors in series.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
All right.
R1 and R2.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And this was my A and B
terminals respectively.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And let's say the complex
amplitude of the voltage was Vab

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
across this.
Then I could relate,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
let's say Iab was the current,
I can relate these resistances.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Or, I could relate Vab and Iab
as follows.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Simply Vab divided by Iab
equals R1 plus R2.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I know that.
And the same thing applies to R

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
viewed as an impedance.
It's still impedance R,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and so this one still goes
ahead and applies.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The second thing I can try is
the circuit of this form.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
A, B, and I have an R1 and an L
in this case.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And what I can do is,
in the impedance model,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I can view this as an impedance
of value j omega L.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And I can also combine them to
get the impedance between A and

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
B.
Much as I got a resistance

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
between A and B,
I can get an impedance between

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
A and B as Vab divided by Iab.
And that will be given by ZR1

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
plus ZL, and that is simply R1
plus j omega L.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Similarly, I can do an even
more complicated circuit.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, resistance.
And here I have a capacitor in

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
series with the resistance,
and then I apply inductor to

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
it.
This is A, B,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Iab and plus,
minus Vab.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And let me call this R1 and let
me call this R2 and this is C

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and L.
I can go about combining these

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
in much the same manner that I
combine my resistances in the

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
series parallel simplifications.
I can define an impedance Zab

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
between the A and B terminals as
ZR1 plus Z of this combination,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
impedance of this combination,
which is simply impedance of C

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and that of R2 in parallel with
each other.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I get Zc in parallel with ZR2.
Notice that this notation

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
simply says that look at the
impedance of the capacitor in

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
parallel with a resistor.
And then, finally,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I add to that the series
impedance of the inductor ZL.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Exactly as you would have done
for resistances,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
if all of these resistances you
would have said R of this piece

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
plus the R of the parallel
combination plus the R of

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
whatever was here.
This time around we have

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
impedances.
And replacing this with the

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
values, this is R1.
I know for ZL it's j omega L.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And so, for ZL,
parallel ZR2 it is given by

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000
ZCZR2 divided by ZC plus ZR2,
which is simply R1 here and j

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
omega L.
And let me just substitute the

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
values here.
I know that ZR2 is simply R2,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
ZC is one by j omega C,
and then one by j omega C plus

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
R2.
And I can go ahead and simplify

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
that further and get my
impedance Zab.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Notice how simple analysis has
become.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Using this technique,
using the impedance method

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
we've managed to convert our
analysis from solving

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
differential equations to going
back to algebra.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
A large part of what we do in
circuits is see how we can get

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
back to really simple algebra
and try to be clever about how

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
we do things.
So, this is as far as analysis

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
is concerned.
In the next five minutes,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I want to give you some insight
into how you can build different

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
kinds of impedances.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And I won't go into too much
detail but give some insight

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
into how you can get a sense for
the kind of filters you want to

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
design.
Or, at the very least,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
given a filter,
how can you very quickly get

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
some insight into what kind of
filter it is,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
how it performs,
what its frequency response is

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and so on.
And, this time around,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
this piece of intuition will be
in honor of Umans.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And back to our Bend it Like
Beckham series,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I call this "Unleash it like
Umans".

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
What experts in the field do is
they don't go about sitting

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
around writing differential
equations, but rather use a lot

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
of insight into how to solve
these things.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And so in honor of Umans,
I will label this unleash it

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
like Umans.
Let's get some insight into how

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
the response of various elements
look like.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Let's take, for example,
I have some impedance Z.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Let's say this could be a
resistor, it could be an

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
inductor or it could be a
capacitor.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Let's take a look at what the
frequency response of just these

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
elements look like.
In other words,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
what are the frequency
dependents of Z itself?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Let me just plot the impedance
of each of these elements as a

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
function of frequency.
Let me just take the absolute

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
value of their impedance.
Notice that it's a complex

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
number.
For the inductor it's j omega

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
L.
And let me take the absolute

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
value omega L in that case and
plot it for you.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And use that to develop some
insight.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Let's do a simple case first.
If Z is a resistance of value R

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
then no matter what the
frequency my value is going to

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
be R.
If I have an inductor of value

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
L then the impedance is going to
look like j omega L,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
and so I am going to omega L
for that.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And the dependence of that
simply says that for low omega

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
the impedance is very small.
For omega zero the impedance is

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
zero and it increases linearly
with omega.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
So, it's omega L for the
inductor.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Impedance increases linerally
as I increase the frequency.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
What about for the capacitor?
For the capacitor,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
the impedance is one divided by
j omega C.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
And so, therefore,
I get the dependence being

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
related to omega C.
Which says that for very high

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
frequencies impedance is very
low, but for very low

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.000
frequencies the impedance is
very high and I get a behavior

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
pattern that looks something
like this.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
It goes as one by omega C.
As omega is very large,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
my impedance is very small.
If omega is very small,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
my impedance goes towards that
of an open circuit.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
This is not surprising.
You've known this before,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
right?
That a capacitor behaves like

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
an open circuit for DC.
An inductor behaves like a

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
short circuit for DC.
Notice that zero frequency here

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
corresponds to DC.
The capacitor looks like an

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
open circuit for DC,
very high impedance.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
The inductor looks like a short
circuit for DC,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
very low impedance.
And the opposite is true at

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
very high frequencies.
While R is a constant

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
throughout.
Let's use this to build some

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
insight into how our circuits
might look.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Let me do this example.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Let's say I have a Vi and I
measure the response across the

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
resistor.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
So, I measure Vr divided by Vi
and take the absolute value and

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
take a look at how it's going to
look like.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I want you to stare at this for
me and help me with what the

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
response is going to look like.
Let's take incredibly high

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
frequencies.
At very high frequencies,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
this has a very high frequency,
what do the capacitor look like

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
to very high frequencies?
Is it an open or is it a short?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
A short circuit.
At very high frequencies the

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
capacitor looks like a short
circuit.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Then Vi simply appears across
the resistor,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
which means that at very high
frequencies the output is very

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
close to the input.
At very low frequencies what

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
happens?
At very low frequencies the

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
capacitor looks like an open
circuit.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
If this looks like an open
circuit then very little voltage

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
will drop across this resistor
here because most of it is going

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
to drop across the capacitor.
What is going to happen is,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
for very low values,
I am going to be looking at

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
something out here.
And, because of that,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
my response looks like this.
And this is of a different form

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
than the one you saw earlier.
In this case,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I pass high frequencies but
attenuate low frequencies.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Not surprisingly,
this is called a high pass

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
filter.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
You need to begin to be able to
think about capacitors and

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
inductors in terms of their high
and low frequency properties.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And, if you develop that
intuition, once you develop the

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
intuition about capacitors and
inductors and their frequency

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
relationship,
that will be a big step forward

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
in 002.
If you get that insight,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
you will go a long way in terms
of knowing how to tackle

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
problems and being able to
quickly sketch responses.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Yes.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
In the case of,
if we get something like j

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
omega L, what you can do is take
the limit as omega goes to zero.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
If it is omega L then notice
that it is going to start

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
linear.
And, on the other hand,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
if when you get very high
frequencies, for example,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
if you get one by something
omega C then this is a

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
hyperbolic relationship,
so it is going to go ahead

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
looking like this.
So, you can take a look at a

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
lot of these functions at their
very low values and see how they

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
look like at that point.
All right.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
The next one I would like to
draw for you is something that

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
looks like this.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Let's say, for example,
I have an inductor L and a

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
resistor R and I want to see
what that looks like.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
In this particular example,
I have H, take the absolute

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
value.
So, what is this going to look

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
like?
I am going to look at the value

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
across the resistor here.
Here what I am going to find is

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
that at very low frequencies
this guy is a short circuit.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Since this guy is a short
circuit, all the voltage drops

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
across the resistor so it's
going to look like this.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And, at very high frequencies,
what I am going to find is that

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
the inductor is going to appear
like an open circuit.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And so, therefore,
all the voltage is going to

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
pretty much drop across the
inductor.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
It will be R divided by
something plus omega L.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
So, at high frequencies this
guy is going to taper off to

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
zero and is going to look like
this.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And this is back to my low pass
filter.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Just to go back to a question
asked earlier,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
how do you know what this looks
like?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
I can very quickly write down
the expression for H of j omega.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
This is simply going to be R
divided by R plus if this is VR.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
VR is simply R divided by one
by j omega C.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
I multiply it out by j omega C
in the numerator and the

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
denominator.
I'm going to find j omega C

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
here and I am going to get one
by j omega C here.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And what is going to happen
with something like this is that

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
as omega becomes very small then
I am going to ignore this.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
When omega becomes very small,
I can ignore this with respect

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
to one, and I get R j omega C.
Given that, is what I've drawn

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
here correct or wrong?
This goes away with respect to

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
one.
I am left with R j omega C,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
right?
For very low frequencies.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Given what I have drawn here,
is that correct or is that

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
wrong?
Well, it's hard to say.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
For very, very low frequencies
it starts out being linear

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
because it's an omega
relationship,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
and then it goes up like this
and then goes out there.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Let me go onto another example.
Let me do another example here

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000
which is something like --
I need to make sure I don't

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
make a mistake here.
If I get R j omega C by R j

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
omega C, you know what,
this ends up being a first

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
order system,
and so is going to look like

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
this.
I blew it there.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Back to this system here.
If I have an L and an R and I

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
look at this equation to look at
what happens across L,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000
you can plot that again.
And for very low frequencies it

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
is going to be zero amplitude
here and for very high

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
frequencies this is going to be
an open circuit,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and so the response is going to
look something like this.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
That's going to end up being
your high pass filter.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
As another example,
I would like to do a series RLC

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
circuit --

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
-- and try to get you some
sense of what that output looks

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
like.
Let's use our intuition and

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
first write down what this looks
like and then go and do some

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
math and see if the math
corresponds to what our

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
intuition tells us.
I want to plot Vr with respect

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
to Vi.
I want to plot it there.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
For something like this,
what happens at very low

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
frequencies?
We are just looking to get

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
very, very crudely what this
graph is going to look like.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Very, very crudely what this
graph is going to look like.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Given that I am taking the
voltage across VR,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
what happens at very low
frequencies?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
At incredibly low frequencies,
the inductor looks like a short

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
circuit, but the capacitor looks
like open circuit.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
An open circuit in series with
a short circuit that ends up

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
looking like an open circuit.
And so, therefore,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
all my voltage falls across VR.
Now, what happens at very high

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
frequencies?
At very high frequencies the

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
capacitor looks like a short.
But the inductor looks like an

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
open circuit now for very high
frequencies, correct?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Just remember,
capacitor is short for high

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
frequencies inductor open for
high frequencies.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
So, this ends up having a very
high impedance.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
At very high frequencies this
guy has a very high impedance.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And, because of that,
for a high value of frequency,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I end up going in that manner.
This behavior has the effect of

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
the capacitor here.
And for very high frequencies I

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
get the effect of the inductor.
And so this means that I have

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
very low values for low
frequencies, very low values for

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
high frequencies.
And, as the frequency

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
increases, I do something like
this.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I keep building up,
then the inductor begins to

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
play a role, and then I taper
off again.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
This kind of a filter where I
kill low and high frequencies

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
and pass intermediate
frequencies is called a band

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
pass filter, BPF.
This means that it passes

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000
frequencies in some band.
Let's get some more insight on

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
this by writing down the
equations.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
So, Vr divided by Vi is simply
R.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Using the impedance relation it
is R divided by j omega L plus

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.000
one divided by j omega C plus R.
I am going to use this equation

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000
later, so let me stash it away
on my stack and put a little

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
notation there.
I am going to multiply

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
throughout by j omega C.
And what I end up getting is j

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
omega RC divided by one plus R j
omega RC, and then here,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I get j times j is minus one,
so I get minus omega squared.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Let me rewrite it this way.
I get minus omega squared.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So, j j is minus one,
omega times omega is omega

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
squared, and then I get an LC.
That's what I end up getting.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
And if I take the absolute
value here, I end up getting,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
back to your complex algebra,
the square root of this real

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
value squared plus imaginary
value squared.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
So, one minus omega squared LC
plus omega RC squared.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
This is from,
you can look it up in your

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
complex algebra appendix in the
course notes.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
It's simply omega RC here,
then square of the real value

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
plus the square of the imaginary
value, and take the square root

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
of that.
By staring at this,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
you can notice that you realize
a really important property.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
When omega equals LC.
I'm sorry.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
When omega equals one divided
by LC, what happens?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Sorry, square root of LC.
When omega is one divided by

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:30.000
square root of LC then omega
squared times LC becomes one.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
When this is true then this
becomes one, and one and one

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
cancel out.
And, not only that,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
when these cancel out,
these two cancel out at that

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
point, so I end up getting a
one, which means that when omega

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
equals omega nought equals one
by square root of LC and I end

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
up getting a value that is one.
It's pretty amazing.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Which means that if I drive
this at omega nought,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
if my sinusoid has a frequency
omega nought where omega nought

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
is one by square root of LC,
if I'm sitting here and this is

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
a black box on the right-hand
side, and I drive this at a

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
frequency omega nought equals
one divided by square root of

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
LC, what does this entire
circuit look like to me?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
I'm sitting there,
the black box here.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I'm driving it at omega nought
equals one by square root of LC

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
at that frequency.
What does that circuit look

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.000
like?
Yes.
It looks like a resistor.
It's pretty amazing.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
It means that even though I
have an L and a C here,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
if I happen to drive this at
omega nought then the circuit

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
looks purely resistive and it
seems to give me the same input

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
appearing at the output.
In other words,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
the effect of these two cancels
out.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
And that aspect is called
driving the circuit at its

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
resonance point.
Resonance is when you're

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
driving the circuit at omega
nought equals one by a square

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
root of LC.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I will very quickly sketch for
you a couple of other ways of

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
looking at circuits.
Supposing I looked at this

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
value here, Vlc,
I looked at the value across

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
the inductor and the capacitor,
what will the frequency

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
response look like?
I am looking at the voltage

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
across the inductor and the
capacitor in series.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Let's see.
Let's go back to our usual

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
mantra.
Think about Steve Umans when

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
you do this.
What would he do?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
He would say ah-ha,
at very low frequencies the

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
capacitor is going to look like
an open circuit.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
In my voltage divider,
I am measuring the voltage

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
across an open circuit,
so the entire Vi must drop

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
across the inductor and
capacitor.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Similarly, at very high
frequencies the inductor looks

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
like an open circuit now,
so it looks like this.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
At very high frequencies
inductor is an open circuit.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
And, again, I'm looking at the
voltage divider across the near

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
infinite resistance,
impedance, so I get a high

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
value here as well.
Well, in the middle the value

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
dips and I get something like
this.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
So, this thing is called a band
stop filter.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Here I can nail any specific
frequency, as long as the

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
frequency falls in roughly that
regime.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Yet another example.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
The reason I'm working on so
many examples is that to

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
experts, a large part of what
they do is look at a circuit and

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
boom, give a rough form of how
it looks like.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
That can get you half the way
there in most of what you're

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
going to do.
How did this look like?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
If I take the voltage Vo versus
Vi, let's take a look.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
At very low frequencies,
the inductor looks like a short

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
circuit, correct?
I am talking the voltage across

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
a short circuit,
so it looks like this.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
At very high frequencies,
I am taking a voltage across a

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
parallel combination,
but the capacitor is now a

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
short circuit.
So, that looks like a

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
capacitor.
This looks like an inductor out

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
here and this is a capacitor
holding sway here.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And so, somewhere in the middle
it goes up and comes down like

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
that.
So, it's a band pass filter.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
What is amazing is that you can
take fairly complicated

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
circuits, and just by doing a
quick analysis of what happens

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
at very low frequencies,
what happens at very high

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
frequencies, you can roughly
sketch the response.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And then what you should do,
in addition to that,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
is if it's a second order
circuit, just assume that it's

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
going to do something
interesting at its resonance

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
frequency, at omega nought
equals one by square root of LC.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Something interesting is going
to happen.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Check it out.
And for circuits that are first

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
order, RC or RL,
the important number is the

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
time constant RC.
Usually, when you're driving it

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
at one by RC,
omega equals one by RC then

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
what happens is that you often
times end up getting a value

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
that is one by square root two
times the input value in the

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
circuits we looked at here.
Next, what I am going to do is

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
talk about a major,
major application of filters.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.000
And that is an AM receiver.
Let me do Radios 101 for 30

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
seconds.
These guys have an antenna.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.000
You take a ground here.
You pick up a signal at your

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
antenna.
There is an implied ground as

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
well.
And what you do,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
as a first step,
is you begin processing the

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
signal now.
What we place right there is a

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
little filter that looks like
this.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
It is a inductor and a
capacitor in parallel.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
And this capacitor is really
your tuner that you can tune to

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
radio frequencies.
And then what you have here is

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
a bunch of other processing and
end up with your speaker.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
And the processing that happens
here is you have a demodulator,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
you have an amplifier and a
bunch of other things that let's

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
not worry about them for now.
What we do here is the antenna

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
picks up a signal.
So, in some sense,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
this part of the circuit here
is your source.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I could replace it with its
Thevenin equivalent as follows.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
So, the front end of your radio
looks like a Vi,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
R, L and a C.
Where have you seen this

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
before?
Right there.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
That's the front end of radios.
Let me tell you why I need a

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
band pass filter in a radio out
here.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
The way life works is as
follows.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
I have my frequency.
Let me do this not in radians

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.000
but in kilohertz for now,
and let me plot your radio

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
signal strength.
In the Boston area,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.000
the signals go between 540
kilohertz and they go all the

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
way to 1600 kilohertz.
In some areas we have begun to

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
use the 1700 extra band as well
for some new stations.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
This is the frequency range of
interest.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
If you look at your radio
tuner, you will see 540

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
kilohertz all the way up to 1600
and you can tune your AM radio.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
The way it works is that each
station is given 10 kilohertz of

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
spectrum here.
And so, this is at 1000

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
kilohertz, 1010 kilohertz and so
on.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And each station transmits its
signal in plus or minus 5

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000
kilohertz around that point.
And this station transmits it

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
here and this station transmits
it here and so on.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
This is 1030.
This guy is WBZ News Radio

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
1030, for those of you who
listen to it.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000
What happens is that at 10
kilohertz, each station gets 10

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
kilohertz, and so WBZ transmits
in the 10 kilohertz around 1030.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Notice that each of these
signals transmitted by radio

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
stations happen within small
bands.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Now, you will learn a lot more
about modulation and how do you

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
get a signal to go in a small
band and all that stuff.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:00:06.003
You will learn about that in

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
For now, don't worry about how
I did all of this.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
How do you listen to that
station?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
The way you listen to that
station is you put a low pass

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
filter here.
You put a low pass filter that

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
does the following.
Let's say I want to hear WBZ

00:17:10.000 --> 00:45:51.000
If I can arrange to have the

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
If I pass this entire signal
through that filter.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And if I arrange to have the
omega nought of my filter at

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
omega nought at 1030 then this
is the response of my filter.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
And I am going to pick out this
guy and cut out everything else.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
I am just going to get this.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Let's listen to the station for
some time.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
So, you can see I can tune to
the station WBUL.

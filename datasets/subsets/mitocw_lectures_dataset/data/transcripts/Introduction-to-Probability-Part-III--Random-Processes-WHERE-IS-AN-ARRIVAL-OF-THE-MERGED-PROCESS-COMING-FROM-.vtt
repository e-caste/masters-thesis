00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.060
As before, we have a red Poisson
process and a green Poisson

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.730
process.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.410
We merge these two
processes, and we only

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.090
observe the merged process.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.830
Here's an interesting question.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.320
This is an arrival of
the merged process.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.880
Where did it come from?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.170
Is it red, or is it green?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.020
We cannot know, but can we tell
what is the probability that it

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.990
came from the red stream?

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.350
The way to answer
this question is

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.340
to look at the table
of all the things

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.810
that can happen during
a little interval

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.640
around that particular time
in which we had an arrival.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.390
We are told that there was an
arrival at time t or an arrival

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.760
during an interval, a small
interval around time t.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.270
This means that we're told that
this event here has happened.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.520
Given this information, what
is the conditional probability

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.340
that actually this
event here occurred?

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.080
This is just the fraction
of this probability divided

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.370
by the total probability
of the conditioning event.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.270
So the answer is
lambda 1 divided

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.789
by lambda 1 plus lambda 2.

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.730
Does this answer make sense?

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.310
Well, suppose that lambda
1 and lambda 2 were equal.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.070
In that case, by symmetry,
when an arrival comes,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.530
it should be equally likely to
have come either from the red

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.580
or from the green stream.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.650
And this is consistent
with this answer.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.080
We can reason similarly for a
slightly different question.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.620
You wait until the kth arrival,
let's say the third arrival.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.140
Where did that
arrival come from?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, that case,
arrival occurred

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.700
during a specific little time
interval and conditioning

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.170
on it having occurred during
that particular time interval,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.190
we can then repeat the reasoning
that we had here and argue

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.370
that given that we had an
arrival-- it just happens

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.270
to be the third arrival
during that time interval--

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.680
there's going to be this
particular conditional

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.050
probability that it came
from the red stream.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.730
So we obtained the
same answer once more.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.650
Now, this arrival came
from one of the two streams

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.079
with some probabilities.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.420
This arrival came from
one of the two streams

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.930
with some probabilities.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.140
Does the origin of this
arrival affect or depend

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.790
on the origin of that arrival?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.220
Because we have
assumed independence

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.710
across time for each
one of the processes

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.780
that we started with--
and therefore, we also

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.010
have the same thing for the
merged process-- whatever

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.630
has to do with events
during this interval

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.710
is independent
from anything that

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.500
has to do with events
in that interval.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.670
And because of this, one
could argue formally--

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.250
but hopefully, this
is intuitive enough--

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.310
that the origin of this arrival
and the origin of that arrival

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.690
are independent events.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.600
And now that we
have this property,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.390
we can answer questions
such as the following.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.060
We've had 10 arrivals so far.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.930
What is the probability that
exactly four out of these 10

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.845
are red?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.750
Each one of those arrivals has
this probability of being red.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.130
The origin of different arrivals
are independent of each other.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.240
So essentially, we're dealing
with 10 Bernoulli trials,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.370
each of which has two possible
outcomes, red or green,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.160
and is red with this
particular probability.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.910
Therefore, the
answer is going to be

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.090
given by the binomial
probabilities, which

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.780
is the probability of having
four successes in 10 trials.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.580
And we obtain lambda 1 over
lambda 1 plus lambda 2.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.810
That's the probability of a red
to the number of red arrivals.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.730
And then the
remaining probability,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.160
1 minus that, which is
lambda 2 over lambda 1

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.270
plus lambda 2 to the remaining
power, which is equal to 6.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.110
So to summarize.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.140
Each one of the arrivals
in the merged process

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.680
has a certain
probability of being

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.750
a red arrival or
a green arrival.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.940
Which one of the
two is the case?

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.130
We can think of it as an
outcome of Bernoulli trial,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.580
and the Bernoulli
trials associated

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.670
with different arrivals are
independent of each other

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.880
as a consequence of the
independence of Poisson

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.750
processes across time.

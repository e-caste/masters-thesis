00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.560
MATTHEW VANDER HEIDEN: OK.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.680
Today we will start
our discussion of--

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.310
with a discussion of
glycolysis as a pathway

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.600
and how we can use favorable
oxidation of glucose

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.600
to enable phosphate addition
while at the same time

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.760
producing useful
intermediates that

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.300
enable us to do ATP synthase--

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.760
ATP synthesis and maintain a
high ATP-ADP ratio in cells.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.840
Now I drew up here the
entire glycolytic pathway,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.570
just like you saw at the
end of the last lecture,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.690
and I want to go through
it here step by step.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.710
And so the first
step in glycolysis,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.650
as we already talked
about, is we have glucose.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.290
This here is, of course,
alpha-D-Glucose in the--

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.590
I drew it in the alpha form.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.090
If the OH was pointing up, that
would be the beta form, just

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.239
some quick review.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.800
I'll drop the alpha and beta
and the stereochemistry denotion

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.480
going forward.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.930
This glucose molecule, as
we discussed previously,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.380
is first trapped in cells
by being phosphorylated

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.280
by the enzyme hexokinase,
sometimes abbreviated HK,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.370
to give glucose 6-phosphate.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.830
Not shown here, this
glucose 6-phosphate

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.890
then undergoes an
isomerase reaction

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.720
via the open chain form.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.580
Again, we discussed
this reaction

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.260
when we discussed sugars.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.070
And so this would be catalyzed
by glucose phosphate isomerase,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.860
and takes it from the
aldose to the ketose,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.340
and now you have the
fructose-- the ketose fructose

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.860
6-phosphate shown here
in the furanose form.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.880
This fructose 6-phosphate
is then phosphorylated

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.570
a second time by an enzyme
called phosphofructokinase,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.865
typically abbreviated PVK.

00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:05.050
It's phosphorylated on the
1 position to give fructose

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.560
1,6-bisphosphate, shown here.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.450
That fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
can then be cleaved via

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.220
the enzyme aldolase.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.360
Cleavage takes place in the open
chain form which I drew up here

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.470
in the corner.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.890
Basically splitting
the molecule in half

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.570
to form two trioses, one
of which is the ketose

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.680
dihydroxyacetone phosphate,
basically the top half

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.950
of the molecule.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.760
The other is the bottom
half of the molecule,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.720
the aldose glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.040
These two trioses can be
interconverted, the aldose

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.572
and the ketose via on isomerase.

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:49.030
The enzyme that
does that is called

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.220
trioses phosphate isomerase.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.370
And moving forward basically
takes the dihydroxyacetone

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.510
phosphate that comes from
the top half and can turn all

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.590
the carbon from fructose
1,6-bisphosphate into two

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.560
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.100
That glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
as we discussed last time,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.130
is the substrate for
the GAPDH reaction,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.510
the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, GAPDH.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.640
which, as we
discussed last time,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.450
couples oxidation
of this aldehyde

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.350
to this acid with
phosphate addition.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.420
That oxidation reaction, the
electrons have to go somewhere,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.170
that's where the
cofactor NAD comes in.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.110
Picks up two electrons,
generates NADH,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.750
and in the process, this
enzyme generates this molecule,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.960
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
or 1,3-BPG.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.160
Remember, that 1,3-BPG
molecule was one of the useful

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.440
intermediates whereby we could
undergo favorable synthesis

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.660
of ATP even at the high
ATP-ADP ratio found in cells,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.030
and that's because we can
transfer the phosphate from

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.600
this acid group onto ADP.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.120
That gives us an ATP and the
product 3-phosphoglycerate 3-PG

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.060
carried out by the enzyme
phosphoglycerate kinase.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.230
That 3-PG molecule
can then undergo

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.850
what's referred to
as a mutase reaction.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.180
And so the phosphate
is moved from the 3

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.220
to the 2 position of glycerate.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.640
So 3-phosphoglycerate
to 2-phosphoglycerate,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.380
carried out by phosphoglycerate
mutase, often abbreviated PGAM.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.730
This 2-phosphoglycerate can
then undergo a dehydration

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.720
to-- by an enzyme enolase
to give the molecule

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.490
phosphoenolpyruvate. .

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.860
Phosphoenolpyruvate
was the second

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.160
of those useful
intermediates that

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.600
allow ATP synthesis despite the
high ATP-ADP ratio in cells,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.670
and that reaction, as
we already discussed,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.770
is carried out by
pyruvate kinase

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.600
and allows you to
generate another ATP.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.480
Now, as I drew out the
glycolytic pathway here,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.400
I also listed the delta G0
prime for every single step

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.780
in the reaction.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.120
Remember, this is informative
as to the equilibrium for each

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.940
of these individual reactions.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.670
You'll note that for
many of the steps,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.820
that delta G0 prime is positive.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.950
Remember what that means.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.600
That means that equilibrium
favors the left.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.930
That is the reverse direction
of the entire pathway.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.350
However, if you add
all of these up,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.130
the delta G0 prime for
the entire pathway--

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:58.398
so delta G0 prime for the entire
pathway, glucose to pyruvate

00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:07.240
adds up to negative
6.9 kcals per mole.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.980
And so that negative 6.9 means
that for the entire pathway,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.250
equilibrium favors the right.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.230
So glucose to pyruvate,
the right direction.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.930
And that is why this can
work as an overall pathway

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.440
even though some of the
individual steps, equilibrium

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.570
may favor the
opposite direction.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.700
Now you'll notice that there's
several favorable steps where

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.850
delta G0 prime is
quite negative.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.236
Pyruvate kinase,
phosphoglycerate kinase,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.360
hexokinase, phosphofructokinase.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.860
As we talked about before,
these are able to pull the less

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.450
favorable steps upstream forward
by keeping concentrations

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.010
of products such as
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate low,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.490
thus allowing this net
reaction to move forward.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.480
You'll notice I drew three
steps here as irreversible--

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.430
hexokinase, phosphofructokinase,
and pyruvate kinase.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.930
Remember, these are
all reactions in our--

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.600
there's no such thing as
an irreversible reaction.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.450
There are some conditions
where the reverse reaction,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.190
of course, can happen.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.550
Although remember, this--
when we discussed irreversible

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.800
in metabolism, what
we're referring to

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.190
is irreversible under
physiological conditions-- that

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.680
is, conditions found in cells.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.900
You'll notice that
those three steps

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.395
are three of the four steps
that have very negative delta

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.940
G0 prime.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.440
And so you would
expect that if we

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.030
were going to reverse
those reactions,

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.460
you would need some
kind of energy input,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.160
and you'll see later that these
are the control points or also

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.500
regulated steps in this pathway.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.570
And there are also the
sites, just to give you

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.028
a preview, that
we're going to have

00:07:58.028 --> 00:08:01.580
to deal with if we're going
to try to synthesize glucose,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.690
gluconeogenesis, the
reverse of glycolysis.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.690
Now of course, these
delta G0 primes

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.010
are very informative of
what happens at equilibrium,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.370
but of course, what
actually happens in a cell

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.170
or in any condition,
remember, is

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.880
dependent on the
equilibrium constant,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.330
but also on the conditions.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.860
Remember, it's delta G, delta
G equals delta G0 prime plus RT

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.900
times the log of the
products over the reactants.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.550
And so delta G is
what really matters

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.010
for any individual
reactions, and what's

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.280
shown here on this
slide is basically

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.159
a approximate delta G0 change
across the glycolytic pathway

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.300
based on someone's approximation
of the conditions found

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.410
in cells.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.000
Now we can see and
looking at this

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.180
that there's really three
big drops in delta G

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.590
across the pathway.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.780
Here's the hexokinase
reaction, here's

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.940
the phosphofructokinase
reaction,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.870
here's the pyruvate
kinase reaction.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.250
And so it makes sense
that these would be,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.500
then, the irreversible
steps because there

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.090
is what is actually pulling
the pathway forward.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.170
It also makes sense that
one would exert control

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.810
at each of these
steps, because this

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.750
is what drives the flux
of the pathway forward,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.630
but it's also where it's
difficult to go back.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.760
Once you get here on this
flat part of the curve

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.250
energetically it doesn't
matter so much which

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.200
direction you go
along the curve,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.600
but to try to climb back
up each of these hills

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.320
becomes difficult. And so
we'll revisit this later

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.480
in the lecture, but
this is basically

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.460
where the control
points will end up

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.300
happening in this pathway.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.020
Now, I want to note a
couple other features

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.460
about this pathway,
and that is that we had

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.510
to invest some energy early.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.800
You see you cost an
ATP at the hexokinase

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.320
and the phosphofructokinase
step and then

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.030
you harvest that ATP much later
at the phosphoglycerate kinase

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.780
and the pyruvate kinase steps.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.340
The textbook typically
will split glycolysis

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.270
into what they refer to as
two stages, an investment

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.470
stage and a harvesting
stage, and that basically

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.780
relates to that fact.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.980
And that's because you have a
glucose molecule that then you

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.010
use to generate two trioses.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.750
And then each of
those trioses can

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.670
be used to generate
a pyruvate molecule.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:59.710
And so it costs 2 ATP to
generate those to trioses,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:08.660
but then each triose generated
allows you to recapture 2 ATPs.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.530
And so what that means,
then, is that the net output

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.310
from glycolysis is 2 ATPs.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:27.720
And so glucose going
to two glyceraldehyde

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:44.110
3-phosphates costs you, whereas
using those two glyceraldehyde

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:50.890
3-phosphates to
generate two pyruvates

00:11:50.890 --> 00:12:00.880
allows you to recover 4 ATP for
a net of plus 2 ATP molecules

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.230
produced per
glucose metabolized.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.000
Now if we add up the entire
stoichiometry of what's

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.120
going on here, we can
also draw it another way,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.480
and that is we can
basically have glucose

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:24.730
plus 2 ATP molecules plus
2 inorganic phosphates,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:34.910
goes to 2 pyruvates
plus 2 ATP, and that's

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.790
because we're able
to incorporate

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:47.020
2 phosphate molecules
here at the GAPDH step.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.110
Now that's great, but if
you're paying attention,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.390
you notice that we're
missing one other thing

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.550
in this stoichiometry,
and that's

00:12:54.550 --> 00:13:00.790
that cofactor NAD that was also
required to maintain electron

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.870
balance across the GAPDH step.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:10.360
And so remember that for
these pathways to work,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.150
we have to balance all
things that are going in

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.680
with all things
are going out-- we

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.870
can't create or destroy matter.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.370
And so those electrons
have to be dealt with.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.060
When we discussed the
GAPDH reaction last time,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.640
we needed that cofactor NAD
in order to act as an acceptor

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.840
for the electrons to allow
that oxidative phosphorylation,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.260
if you will, of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.650
to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.410
And so in order for
this pathway to work,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.600
we need a way to regenerate
that NADH back to an NAD

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.900
in order to make
electron balance.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.930
In other words, we have
to deal with the fact

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.400
that we've generated--

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:03.860
or that we required 2 NAD+ to
run this pathway and generate 2

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.290
NADH.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:16.730
And so we need a way to get rid
of those electrons from NADH

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:23.430
to regenerate that NAD and allow
the pathway to be balanced.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.950
Now it should be
clear that this has

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.990
to happen stoichiometrically for
every single glucose molecule

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.880
that goes through glycolysis.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.160
That is, we have to regenerate
2 NAD plusses for every glucose

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.240
that we're going to
convert into 2 pyruvates.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.640
And so for this NADH
reoxidation to occur,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.490
we need a place to transfer
those two electron pairs.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.450
And so just like any oxidation
and reduction reaction,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:04.940
if we're going to oxidize
NADH back to NAD+,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.760
something else
has to be reduced,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.290
and that thing has to be reduced
stoichiometrically with every

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:18.140
single pyruvate that's produced
from glucose and glycolysis.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.630
And effectively you
will see that this

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.210
is the role of fermentation.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.500
It's an ability for us to
solve this redox problem,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.790
that we have to dispose of
those electrons in the oxidation

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:37.520
at the GAPDH step in order
to deal with this electron

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.010
waste of the pathway.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.920
Now, the useful
way to do this is

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.180
that we're generating a
pyruvate stoichiometrically.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.270
And so we can use that
stoichiometrically,

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.290
that product pyruvate by
reducing it to form the waste

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.140
product, and that's effectively
what fermentation is.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.590
It's turning that pyruvate
into ethanol or lactate, which

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.130
is reducing that pyruvate,
picking up the electron

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.470
waste from the
NADH, and allowing

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:12.530
you to regenerate the NAD that's
required to run the GAPDH step.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.550
And so I'll just
illustrate this.

00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:31.740
The simplest fermentation
reaction that we can do

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.080
is the run that's
done by animals,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.450
and that's to generate lactate.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.680
And so to just illustrate
this explicitly, here is--

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:02.420
so this here would be the
reduced form of NAD, NADH.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.738
So this here this--

00:17:10.482 --> 00:17:12.450
this is the nicotinamide group.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.970
Remember, it's hooked
up to an ADP ribose

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.690
to give nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide in the reduced

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.550
form.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.680
So this can transfer
electrons to pyruvate.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.920
Here's pyruvate.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:46.130
So as we showed last time,
we can take 2 electrons

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.570
from NADH reduced.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:18:14.040
That gives us this hydride ion,
which can generate lactate.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:31.440
Plus, what we're left
with is the oxidized form

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.240
of the cofactor NAD+.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:43.560
And now this NAD+ can be reduced
back to NADH at the GAPDH step,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.200
and the electrons from NADH, as
it's being reoxidized to NAD,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.290
can go and take pyruvate
and reduce it to lactate.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.430
So NAD gets reoxidized to NAD.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.110
Pyruvate now gets-- the ketone
gets reduced to the alcohol

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:06.010
as you go from
pyruvate to lactate.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.770
Opposite of what's going
on in the GAPDH step.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.880
There, the aldehyde is
oxidized to the acid,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.600
while NAD+ oxidized goes--

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.610
is reduced to NADH.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:23.260
Here, NADH is reoxidized to
NAD while taking the pyruvate

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.470
and re-reducing it to lactate.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:32.860
This, by adding here, allows
us now to regain balance

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.900
across the entire pathway.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:57.230
This step is catalyzed by the
enzyme lactate dehydrogenase,

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.370
often abbreviated LDH.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:16.270
And that allows regenerating
the NAD+ that's needed

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.470
for the GAPDH step, which
allows us to deal with

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:25.310
the stoichiometry problem
of the entire pathway.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.180
And so what fermentation
does for cells

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.420
is allows electron
disposal by taking

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.820
the product of the
pathway pyruvate,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.230
reducing it stoichiometrically
to form a reduced product--

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.930
as shown here, lactate,
and that allows

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.710
you to maintain electron balance
across the entire pathway.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:50.500
And so this entire fermentation
pathway, glucose to lactate,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:56.980
now allows the generation of
the net generation of 2 ATP

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.600
and run this pathway
in cells so cells

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.130
can maintain a high ATP-ADP
ratio by fermenting glucose

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.610
into lactate.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.730
Now, if you're paying
attention, this also

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.930
now begins to describe
why it is that oxygen

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.640
is such a useful
molecule for metabolism

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.060
and actually why it's
quite key to supporting

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.940
the bioenergetics of cells.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.760
And so recall, oxygen was
there when we burned wood

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.440
and we used that example.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.180
And why oxygen is so important
for burning wood, why

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.790
it's important for doing
glucose catabolism in our cells

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.060
is that oxygen is a really
great electron acceptor.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:55.470
That is, I can draw out oxygen
can take 2 electrons that

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.280
are generated as
NADH waste, if you

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:07.200
want to call it
that, plus protons,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.140
and this generates water.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.540
And so an alternative
to fermentation in order

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.410
to allow glucose oxidation is
rather than do fermentation,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.280
is to transfer those
electrons to oxygen

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.920
to run the pathway another way.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:34.230
In other words, if we write
glucose to pyruvate and realize

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.470
that this is an
oxidation reaction,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.430
and so therefore,
generates electron

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:48.690
waste in the form of NADH that
has to be recycled to NAD,

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.770
we can do so by putting
those reoxidizing NADH,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.540
means something else
has to be reduced.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.380
This something else could
be oxygen as a good electron

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:05.060
acceptor to be reduced to water
and find an alternative place

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.980
to put those electrons.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.130
Or, if oxygen is
not present, now we

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.225
can do fermentation, turning
pyruvate into lactate.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.930
It should be clear
that if we want

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:24.870
to completely oxidize
glucose, as in burning wood--

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.610
that is, turn it--

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.760
all the carbon and glucose
into the most oxidized form

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.790
of carbon, CO2,
this also requires

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.520
places to put electrons.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.570
That is, we could
generate more NADH.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.000
And of course, each
of those electrons

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.140
have to be dealt with.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.320
And the final home
for those electrons

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.390
needs to be something
that's a good electron

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:58.240
acceptor like oxygen, allowing
you to continually reoxidize

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.550
your NADH by reducing
oxygen to water.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.350
So, in the absence
of fermentation,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:12.180
oxygen can be used to
maintain electron balance,

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.340
and of course,
much more energy is

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.270
going to be released if
we completely burn glucose

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.060
than if we only partially
oxidize glucose.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.450
And this is why oxygen
allows more energy

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.580
to be released,
or, as you probably

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.940
learned in high school,
more ATP to be produced

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.920
from glucose metabolism.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.120
Now the details of
how all of this works

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.960
are much more complicated
than what I have drawn.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.480
Obviously fermentation
happens the way I drew it,

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.120
but all the other details
about the role of oxygen

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.552
and how it fits in
to these pathways

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.260
is more complicated
than what I've drawn,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.840
and we'll cover this in
the upcoming lectures.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.180
But the key concept
is here, and that

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.050
is the relationship between
oxygen and fermentation

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.790
is really what's
illustrated here.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.790
These are two different
ways that cells

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.720
can use to dispose of
the electron waste that's

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.520
produced from carbon oxidation
and glucose metabolism.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.110
Those electrons have
to go somewhere.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.590
They can go to the
product of glycolysis,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.920
say pyruvate to lactate,
by lactate dehydrogenase,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.010
reduce the pyruvate to
lactate, fermentation,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.960
or they can go somewhere else.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.730
A great electron
acceptor like oxygen

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.140
which allows these
pathways to happen

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.500
while saving the pyruvate
to do something else,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.260
like be completely
oxidized to CO2.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.210
Now it should be
clear here, then,

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.870
that one of the things that's
special about fermentation

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.680
is that absolutely no oxygen
is required to do this,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.250
and this is part of the reason
why this pathway is so ancient.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.720
Fermentation evolved in
the pre-oxygen atmosphere,

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.650
and that really is why it's
such an ancient pathway.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.590
Only when oxygen levels
rose in the atmosphere

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.940
due to photosynthesis that
enough oxygen was around that

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.890
then other oxidative pathways
could evolve as an alternative

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.600
to fermentation.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.100
Now, you'll note that
the original description

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.060
of fermentation by Pasteur
was ethanol, not lactate.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.880
We'll cover the details
of ethanol in a minute,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.330
but I just want to point out
that making ethanol instead

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.500
of lactate is simply
an alternative product

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.230
to dispose of pyruvate as
a more reduced product.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:42.090
So ethanol is a more reduced
product than pyruvate

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:48.270
in that ethanol generation is
an additional adaptation that

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.580
allows you to dispose
of the electron waste

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.410
while also generating a molecule
that's toxic, and therefore,

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.710
allow organisms that make
ethanol to better kill off

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.330
their neighbors and
their environment

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.970
and compete for resources.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.580
But the overall
concept is identical.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.090
Ethanol is really an alternative
to lactate and fermentation

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:13.440
but solves exactly
the same problem.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.250
I want to talk about ethanol
metabolism in more detail,

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.020
but before we do that first
I want to go through and just

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.370
describe at a very high level
some of the chemistry that

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:27.570
allows all these reactions
in glycolysis to work,

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.140
because you'll see that
the chemistry itself is not

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.280
all that complicated even
though we can draw it

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.290
and it seems like
somewhat overwhelming

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.660
when drawn out as
a whole pathway.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.700
Now I want to point
out, we've already

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.040
covered the chemistry
for a lot of these steps.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.360
First of all, there's two
dehydrogenase reactions.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.290
There's GAPDH and there's
lactate dehydrogenase.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.620
Here's the mechanism for
lactate dehydrogenase,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.240
it's a hydride transfer.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.450
The same thing happened at GAPDH
with the additional details

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.800
of adding the phosphate.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.800
We covered that previously
in an earlier lecture.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.533
Note, we also covered before
the chemistry of pyruvate kinase

00:28:11.533 --> 00:28:12.700
and phosphoglycerate kinase.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.070
In addition, there's two
more kinase reactions

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.330
that exist here, hexokinase
and phosphofructokinase.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.030
These are really just
straightforward phosphotransfer

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.990
reactions using ATP to
transfer a phosphate.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.660
Very straightforward,
exactly what

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.600
Professor Yaffe has already
talked to you about,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.170
about how one does
phosphotransfer

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.860
for kinase reactions
on proteins.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.930
Now, two other steps
are isomerase reactions,

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:52.780
triose phosphatase isomerase
and glucose phosphate isomerase.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.290
We discussed this chemistry back
when we did the sugar lectures.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.920
This is just acting on the open
chain form of the carbohydrate

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.710
and allows you to interconvert
between the ketose

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:06.670
and the aldose as I already
drew during that lecture.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.250
And so that just
leaves a few steps

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.190
left to discuss that
we can cover briefly.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.610
The first one that
we'll talk about

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:20.740
is this enolase reaction,
which is simply a dehydration.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:25.570
I'll draw it here just to be
explicit as to what's going on.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.530
So here is 2-phosphoglycerate.

00:29:46.864 --> 00:29:50.490
Simply dehydration
to remove water,

00:29:50.490 --> 00:30:00.745
and that gives us
phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.870
The next step I want to discuss,
phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:12.020
is an example of a mutase
reaction that is, remember,

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.900
it's moving the
phosphate from the 3

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.530
to the 2 position of glycerate.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.790
This is a class of reactions.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.330
It has somewhat of an
interesting mechanism.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.330
And basically precedes
by a phosphorylated

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.250
enzyme intermediate.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.310
In the case of phosphoglycerate
mutase, this is a histidine,

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:36.540
and so there is a histidine
with a nitrogen on it

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.580
in the active site.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.160
And effectively, this nitrogen
can pick up a phosphate and be

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:52.290
primed via a reaction involving
a molecule you've seen already

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.860
from your discussion of
hemoglobin with Professor

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.070
Yaffe, and that's
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.560
And so again, here's--

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.980
this is glycerate phosphorylated
on the 2 and 3 position.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.310
So this is
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:27.030
And effectively, this molecule
can bind in the active site

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.950
and pick up a
phosphate from either

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.810
of the 2 or the 3 position.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.980
I drew it here is picking
it up from the 2 position.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.060
That would, of course,
generate a 3-phosphoglycerate.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.980
But more importantly, it
ends up with the enzyme

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:49.020
having this phosphorylated
intermediate

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.420
in the active site.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.360
Once it has that
phosphorylated intermediate

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:00.660
in the active site, now
it's ready to catalyze

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.415
the mutase reaction.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.310
So I'll draw here
first, this here

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.586
would be 3-phosphoglycerate.

00:32:15.932 --> 00:32:19.470
Color the phosphate so you
can see what's going on.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.510
This would basically, in the
active site of the enzyme,

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:30.410
pick up the phosphate from
the active site and generate

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:49.680
transiently this
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate

00:32:49.680 --> 00:33:01.510
intermediate, and then it can
retransfer the phosphate from

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:06.380
the other position back on to
the active site of the enzyme

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.820
so it's ready to carry out
another catalytic cycle,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:24.110
and in the process, move the
phosphate effectively from

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.090
the 3 position to
the 2 position.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:30.410
So you'll see that the
phosphate is not actually

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.090
being-- the same
phosphate is not

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.250
being moved within
the same molecule,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.950
it's being ping-ponged
back and forth

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.040
off of this phosphate
enzyme intermediate,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.930
and basically this is how
cells catalyze various mutase

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:50.750
reactions to move phosphates
between hydroxyl groups.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.940
And so you have to
prime this once with

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.060
a separately-generated
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate,

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.180
but once you have that
phosphorylated enzyme

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.690
in the active site, it can
now continually ping-pong that

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:07.190
phosphate around to effectively
convert 3-phosphoglycerate

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.530
to 2-phosphoglycerate, or
an example of another mutase

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.190
reaction, move the phosphate
between two other hydroxyl

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.010
groups on the same molecule.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.489
OK.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:22.370
Now the final reaction that we
haven't talked about is this

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.389
one, the aldolase reaction,
which is a really key step

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:30.500
in glycolysis because it splits
that carbon-carbon bond to take

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.000
the hexose--

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.320
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,
and split it into two trioses,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.290
dihydroxyacetone phosphate and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:47.420
which ultimately allows you
to make this pathway work.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:53.880
And so I'll take you quickly
through how aldolase works.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:02.350
So aldolase also has this
amine in the active site.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.830
So here's FBP drawn in
the open chain form.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:38.030
So you end up with
this intermediate

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:46.360
in the active site, which
can undergo this chemistry

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.930
to split this into the--

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.740
remove the lower
half of the molecule.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:11.960
So you can see
here, this generates

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.590
this lower half of the molecule,
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:37:17.590 --> 00:38:52.210
as well as the top half,
which can regenerate

00:38:52.210 --> 00:39:09.410
the active site, as well
as the other product,

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:13.170
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:18.970
And so very briefly, that's
effectively the chemistry that

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.600
allows aldolase to carry
out this important reaction

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.320
in glycolysis, splitting that
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.190
into the aldose,
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:35.510
and the ketose
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.620
OK.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.730
So that is effectively
the chemistry that

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.830
allows you to turn
glucose into pyruvate,

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.440
as well as pyruvate
into lactate,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.230
but what about making ethanol?

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.190
How does that work?

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:58.580
Now ethanol is an alternative
fermentative product.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.640
And so the reactions to make
ethanol is basically this.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.350
So here's pyruvate.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:23.410
First thing that happens
is we lose this CO2.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.590
Without a change in oxidation
state at the second carbon

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.450
at the ketone in pyruvate.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.480
And so this ketone stays
the same oxidation state,

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.360
it's now an aldehyde.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.580
This is a molecule
called acetaldehyde.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:15.600
And now we can pick up those two
electrons from NADH and reduce

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:28.600
this aldehyde to the alcohol,
reoxidizing that NADH back

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:47.330
to NAD+ and generating
ethyl alcohol or ethanol.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:53.210
So, the fermentative part
is turning the acetaldehyde

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.650
into the ethanol because that
allows you to dispose of those

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.610
two electrons, reduce the
aldehyde to an alcohol while

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:08.360
reoxidizing the NADH to an NAD+,
which is what allows glycolysis

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:14.650
to continue so that NAD+ is
available for the GAPDH step.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.235
How this reaction works is--

00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:17.860
I just drew it.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.870
It's exactly how the
lactate dehydrogenase works.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:26.050
However, what we also
now need to discuss

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.820
is how you carry
out this reaction,

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:33.670
this carboxylation to take
this CO2 off of pyruvate

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:37.030
and make acetaldehyde.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.820
Now decarbonization
reactions are really

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.330
common reactions in metabolism.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.910
They end up being important
for lots of pathways.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.870
Obviously if we're going to
completely oxidize glucose

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.290
into CO2, we have to
remove CO2 for a molecule,

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.450
and here's the first one--

00:42:55.450 --> 00:43:00.260
first one that we're going
to see for how that happens.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.530
Now there's two
general mechanisms

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:06.790
that metabolism uses for
decarboxylation reactions,

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:11.090
and I want to introduce the
concept here of both of them.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.560
Now, the first one
here is that these

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.080
are referred to as
decarboxylation reactions that

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.890
occur in the context
of either an alpha keto

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:31.890
acid or a beta keto acid.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.720
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:40.280
Well, pyruvate is
an alpha keto acid,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.120
and that's because
here's a acid group.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:50.150
The ketone is alpha to
the carboxylic acid.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:44:02.570
This would be in contrast
to this molecule.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.410
So I'll just draw with
a generic R group.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:11.160
Where here, the ketone is
beta to the carboxylic acid--

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.720
alpha, beta.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.900
So pyruvate is an
alpha keto acid.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.770
This here is a generic
beta keto acid.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.620
Now I want to point out that
decarboxylations of bait ketone

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.500
acids are very
favorable, and they're

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.585
favorable for the
following reason.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:43.360
And that's because if I remove
this CO2 from a beta keto acid,

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:52.900
I'm left with this molecule,
which hopefully you'll

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.620
recognize as an enol.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.250
And just like we talked
about for the pyruvate kinase

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:13.620
reaction, enols much prefer to
rearrange into the keto form.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:22.140
And so decarbonization
of a beta keto acid

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:27.000
generates an enol which will
rearrange to the ketone.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.100
This becomes very
favorable, and so it

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.240
becomes favorable to
decarboxylate a beta keto acid.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.350
Now, we can't use that
exact same chemistry

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.420
to decarboxylate
an alpha keto acid.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.290
However, we can
help that process,

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.810
effectively mimicking
the same thing that

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.330
happens with beta keto acid, by
instead introducing a cofactor.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.840
So I introduced the
concept of cofactors

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.500
when we talked
about NAD and NADH.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.620
And remember,
cofactors are molecules

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.510
that provide functional
groups that help

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.360
facilitate the chemistry
of various reactions.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.960
And so there's a cofactor that
facilitates the chemistry that

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.920
allows decarboxylation
of alpha keto acids,

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.950
and that cofactor
is abbreviated TPP+,

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:07.680
which stands for the
thiamine pyrophosphate.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:24.180
TPP+, which is derived
from the vitamin thiamine,

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:33.670
sometimes also referred
to as the vitamin B1.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.850
And so this is what
TPP+ looks like.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:21.640
OK.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.810
So like many of our
vitamins or cofactors,

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.230
it's a complex molecule.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.550
So this is vitamin
B1 or thiamine,

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:37.150
and the cofactor TPP+ is
basically the same molecule

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:42.850
with a pyrophosphate group
added on the end, TPP+.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.830
Now, to see what's
going on, we're

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:53.860
going to focus here just on
this part, this reactive part

00:48:53.860 --> 00:49:02.870
of the molecule, which is right
here, which for simplicity, I

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:04.520
will just draw like this.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:15.450
So this here is just this
basically part of the molecule

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.025
here, that's the
reactive part of TPP+.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.470
And what makes this
cofactor useful

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:46.480
is that this basically can exist
in this stabilized carbanion

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.860
form.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:53.530
This stabilized carbanion
can react with alpha keto

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:59.620
acid like pyruvate, shown here.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:32.630
And then this
intermediate now becomes

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:37.070
favorable for decarboxylation
of the CO2 that's

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.200
alpha to the ketone.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:51.180
And then here, we can regenerate
the active TPP+ that we started

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:58.980
with plus the other
product, acetaldehyde.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:14.980
And then that acetaldehyde
can then be reduced,

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:26.610
regenerating NAD+ and giving
alcohol for fermentation.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.210
OK.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:34.310
Now incidentally, this is
how you produce alcohol.

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:37.790
How you metabolize
alcohol is effectively

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.560
reversing that last step
and further oxidizing

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.390
the acetaldehyde.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:55.970
And so this is ethanol.

00:52:55.970 --> 00:53:00.890
So the way ethanol
is metabolized.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:09.370
And so the famous alcohol
dehydrogenase enzyme

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:15.030
basically does that
reverse reaction,

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.840
generates 2 electrons
as a hydride ion.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.420
They get transferred to NAD+.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:30.690
That NAD+ gets reduced to NADH
as this alcohol in ethanol is

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:38.280
oxidized to the aldehyde
in acetaldehyde.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:47.580
And this can then be further
oxidized, that aldehyde

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.180
to the acid.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:10.890
So here again, two electrons
from the hydride iron can

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.680
reduce NAD+ to NADH.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.310
And that generates,
in the process,

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:22.340
oxidizes the
aldehyde to the acid.

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:27.850
In this case, this is acetate.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:33.340
The acid form it would be acetic
acid, also known as vinegar.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:38.650
And so effectively, the way
you turn alcohol into vinegar

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:42.310
is by the
microorganisms oxidizing

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:49.180
the alcohol they produce
into acetic acid or vinegar.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.190
Now note, this is--

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:55.430
alcohol metabolism is
two oxidation reactions.

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:58.300
So we talked about last
time, oxidation reactions

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.940
are generally favorable,
therefore energy is released.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:05.350
This is why alcohol
has calories and it's

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:10.420
impossible to make diet
alcohol, because it will--

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.195
just no way around this.

00:55:12.195 --> 00:55:15.100
A couple other things
about this, as I mentioned.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.840
This enzyme catalyzes.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.220
This is the famous
alcohol dehydrogenase.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:26.020
This enzyme is an
aldehyde dehydrogenase.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.770
The issue is is that
this aldehyde hydrogenate

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:34.750
is a less efficient enzyme
than alcohol dehydrogenase,

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:39.910
thus it can become rate-limiting
for alcohol metabolism.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.340
And so if you
overwhelm the system

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.910
by drinking too much,
effectively this enzyme can't

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.930
keep up with this
enzyme, you generate

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:52.960
excess of the toxic
acetaldehyde product.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.250
Acetaldehyde product is
toxic, and this is effectively

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.310
what generates hangovers.

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:01.960
It's also the case
that there are

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.950
individuals with polymorphisms
of this aldehyde dehydrogenase.

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:08.800
This was, I believe, discussed
in Professor Yaffe's lectures

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.060
on enzyme kinetics that have
different catalytic efficiency

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:16.270
at this step, and the people
who have those polymorphisms

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.770
can't metabolize
alcohol as well.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.340
They tend to get flushing and
whatnot because they build up

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.470
this toxic acetaldehyde,
and in fact,

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.950
can be quite dangerous
if they drink too much.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:31.300
Finally, this also
illustrates effectively

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.200
why when commercially you
want to generate alcohol,

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.580
like in beer or a wine, you
need to keep oxygen levels low.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.480
Why is that?

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.800
Because, well, the microbes
will read their ethanol.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.920
It's a perfectly good source
of calories for them as well

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.870
because of these reactions.

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:53.770
But they generate all this
electron waste in the process.

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:56.080
Those electrons have
to go somewhere.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:56.830
Where do they go?

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.470
Well, oxygen is a great
electron acceptor.

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.010
And so to metabolize
this ethanol,

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.340
they need to put those
electrons somewhere.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.190
They need to put them
on oxygen. And so oxygen

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.730
is required to carry out
this ethanol metabolism

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:14.570
by the microorganisms.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:19.750
And so by keeping oxygen out
of your fermentation of alcohol

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.690
in commercial beer
and wine production,

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:27.730
it prevents the formation
of aldehyde and acetic acid

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:32.920
products which would be
undesirable in your finished

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.045
drink product.

00:57:35.045 --> 00:57:35.545
OK.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.740
Now this whole
discussion also begins

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:51.260
to suggest one big way in which
glycolysis itself is regulated,

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:56.240
and that's effectively by
the availability of oxygen.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.930
And so to be
explicit about this,

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:01.640
I want to draw the relationship
between fermentation,

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:06.980
glycolysis, and oxygen in
terms of maintaining electron

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.720
balance across these pathways.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.490
And so glucose is, of
course, a major fuel for us.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.090
It's a major sugar in our blood.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:19.910
Yeast use a lot of
glucose from the grapes

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:21.940
in their environment.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.780
Plants, of course, make glucose
as a storage carbohydrate.

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.650
It's-- we discussed, starch is
a polymer of glucose that uses

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.420
glucose to survive the night.

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.240
And effectively what they
do is turn that glucose

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.660
into two pyruvate
molecules which

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.980
can be used to generate
net 2 ATP as we discussed.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:49.960
But creates this problem that it
also generates NADH that needs

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.180
to be recycled back to NAD+.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:59.260
In the absence of oxygen,
you can ferment that pyruvate

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:04.450
into lactate or alcohol or some
other product that allows you

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:07.780
to regenerate NAD+.

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:16.220
Or-- and this is a pathway
that requires no oxygen.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:23.950
However, that pyruvate can
be further oxidized to CO2,

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:29.170
but that's going to generate
even more electron waste.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:32.590
That electron waste also
has to be dealt with,

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:38.190
and that requires oxygen
or some other place

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:40.800
to put those electrons,
oxygen to water

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:47.580
being a major driver of
further oxidative metabolism.

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:52.700
Now the beauty of
fermentation as a pathway

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:57.140
is that no oxygen is
needed, but the trade-off

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.140
is that it's much
less efficient.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:05.900
You only get 2 ATP per
mole of glucose that's--

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.860
2 moles of ATP per of
glucose that's fermented.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.410
You can imagine that a lot
more energy is released--

01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:14.840
if you can further oxidized
glucose, you can generate,

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.360
therefore, a lot
more ATP if you use

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.940
a complete oxidation of glucose,
but this requires oxygen.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.930
And so a major way that
glycolysis and certainly

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:33.350
fermentation is regulated
is that low oxygen

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:48.840
is what promotes fermentation,
whereas high oxygen suppresses

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.450
fermentation, and
that makes sense.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.120
It's intuitive.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.880
You get a lot more energy.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.050
If you completely
oxidize your glucose,

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.840
you can more
efficiently get energy

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.330
from oxidation of available
reduced glucose carbon

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.770
if you do it by
oxidative pathways,

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:11.820
and so therefore, in the
presence of plenty of oxygen,

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.670
you don't need to
do fermentation.

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:19.440
Whereas if you outstrip
oxygen supply, as, say,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.090
might happen if your muscles
are exercising, burning more ATP

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:28.170
than can be kept up with by
oxygen delivery from the blood,

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:31.320
now you switch over to a
more affirmative metabolism,

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.080
something like
lactic acid builds up

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.260
that can then be
dealt with later.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:42.990
Now, this fact that high oxygen
can suppress fermentation

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:46.890
is experimentally true in many
organisms in many contexts.

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:50.640
It's likely because
the high ATP-ADP that's

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:56.040
produced with oxidative
glucose metabolism

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.570
can directly affect some steps
or deplete the NAD that's

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:02.610
required to drive glycolysis.

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:04.620
Exactly the
mechanism that causes

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.840
this is somewhat
debated and likely

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.120
depends on context
and conditions.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.450
But it also sets
out at least a way

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.210
for us to begin
discussing, how is it

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:20.350
at a level of individual
enzymes or reactions might

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:24.580
something like high
ATP-ADP ratio effect flux

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.395
or flow through a pathway?

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:09.900
All right.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.400
Well, let's just
start by talking

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.920
about what are the two
things that could affect flux

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.090
or flow through the pathway?

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:25.620
Well, remember,
thermodynamics, delta G,

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.750
is what determines whether
a pathway happens at all.

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:31.530
And because delta G is
proportional to things

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:34.740
like the ATP-ADP
ratio, you can imagine

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.590
if this ratio gets too
high, some of the steps

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:41.450
might no longer be
favorable to occur.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.970
That's certainly
one possibility.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:48.740
But the other way that
regulation can be done

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:55.280
is actually kinetic, and this
is because even though enzymes

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.890
don't determine whether
a reaction can happen,

01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:00.680
at least thermodynamically,
they oftentimes

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.140
do determine the
rate of the reaction,

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.170
and when we're talking about
rate and flow through--

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.540
flux through pathways,
flow through pathways,

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.890
now rate can become
very important.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.280
And so the kinetics of
enzymes, exactly what

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.880
you talked-- heard about with
Professor Yaffe, properties

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.960
like V max or Km of an
enzyme, which, of course, can

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.470
be affected by allostery,
and Professor Yaffe covered

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:28.040
in great detail, these
also, you can imagine,

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.840
can affect how a
pathway is regulated.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.550
And of course, things like ATP,
ADP, and AMP as small molecules

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:42.950
can be good allosteric
affectors of some enzymes.

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.380
And so let's now
talk about, if we're

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.820
going to regulate steps in a
pathway, which steps should

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.520
actually be regulated.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:58.280
And so shown here is, again,
coming back to our delta G

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.240
change map across glycolysis,
as we alluded to earlier,

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.920
the steps where
it's hard to go back

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.730
is this hexokinase step, this
phosphofructokinase step,

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:09.950
and this pyruvate kinase
step, because these

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:12.440
are where there's the
big change in delta G

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.920
that now makes it hard
to reverse those steps.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.610
And it's exactly those
steps that are regulated,

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:20.900
because that makes sense.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.900
If this delta G is
thermodynamically driving flux

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.930
through the pathway,
changing the rate

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:29.420
of the enzymes that
catalyze those steps

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:34.490
is also going to change the rate
at which the pathway as a whole

01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:35.750
can happen.

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:38.780
Now as a result, it's
these steps, hexokinase,

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.330
phosphofructokinase,
pyruvate kinase,

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:45.020
that are often referred to
as the rate-limiting steps

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.450
of glycolysis.

01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:51.890
Personally, I don't like
referring to memorizing things

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.710
like these are the rate-limiting
steps of the pathway,

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:57.500
because in reality,
what step of any pathway

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.630
is going to depend
on the context.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:03.350
However, often this concept
of rate limitation when people

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:06.110
refer to pathways
really is coming

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:11.600
from this energetic
argument about which steps

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.050
have the biggest drop in delta
G, and it's important for you

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:17.570
to understand that,
not just memorize

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:20.130
what steps are rate-limiting.

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:22.970
Now I also want to point out
that these steps actually

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:26.280
are in interesting
places in glycolysis.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.130
So this is basically
entry into the pathway,

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:32.190
and this is exit
from the pathway.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.560
And this makes sense, too.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.460
You don't want to
start committing carbon

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:42.120
into a pathway unless you're
actually going to need it,

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.870
and you also need to
match output to input.

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:48.020
And what you'll see is
that many steps in pathways

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.210
that are regulated,
in addition to being

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.760
the ones with the
biggest delta G changes,

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.080
are also often the entrance and
exit from the pathway, which,

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.390
of course, is the
case in glycolysis,

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.880
but also in most
pathways it makes

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.320
a lot of sense just from
logical considerations.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:06.920
All right.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.810
Now if we're going
to control things

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:12.230
that the level of
enzymes and rate,

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:16.580
how can we control
rate of a reaction?

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:20.030
That is, how can we
control enzyme kinetics?

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:23.270
Well, if you remember from
Professor Yaffe's lectures,

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:28.160
you can increase the rate
of a reaction-- that is,

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.960
catalyzed by an enzyme--

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.790
by increasing the Vmax
of that enzyme; or, if

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.850
the substrate concentration
is close to Km,

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:43.700
by lowering the
Km of that enzyme.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.672
How can you decrease the rate?

01:07:45.672 --> 01:07:47.130
Of course, you can
do the opposite.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:52.640
You can decrease the Vmax; or,
if the substrate concentration

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.890
is close to Km, you
can increase the Km.

01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.600
So how can I change
these things?

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:05.060
How can I alter Vmax or Km
of an individual enzyme?

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.160
Well, there's a number
of ways I can do this.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.515
One is is I can
make more enzyme.

01:08:14.445 --> 01:08:16.840
What will making more enzyme do?

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:21.670
Well, effectively that will
increase the Vmax of an enzyme.

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:23.170
Or if I get rid of
enzyme, that will

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.229
decrease the Vmax of an enzyme.

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:35.439
I can use a different
version of the same enzyme.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:39.069
That is, have an enzyme
like pyruvate kinase

01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:41.560
but have it come in a bunch
of different varieties,

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.620
have different genes encode
different pyruvate kinase

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:49.540
isoforms such that those
isoforms have different Vmax

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.710
and Km relationships with
respect to substrate,

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.990
and effectively, by
using a different version

01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:00.490
of the enzyme, a so-called
isoform of an enzyme,

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:04.540
you can now have
different properties.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.990
Now you'll note that
the change enzyme

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:14.260
kinetics this way basically is
new transcription translation.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.800
That's fairly long
on the timescale

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:24.010
of needing to adapt to
metabolism, but that can work.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:26.725
But sometimes a
lion's attacking you,

01:09:26.725 --> 01:09:28.149
you need to run
away quickly, you

01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:31.270
may not have time
to make more enzyme.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:35.350
You also need direct
control of the enzymes,

01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:39.370
and this is where allosteric
regulation of enzyme function

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:40.750
comes into play.

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:45.890
Allosteric regulation can
be a result of signaling.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:48.200
Phosphorylate,
acetylate an enzyme,

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.450
that can change its properties.

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:54.590
Or you can have
metabolite binding.

01:09:54.590 --> 01:10:00.260
Bind ATP, bind AMP into
some allosteric site

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:07.580
that can change Vmax or Km and
operate on a short time scale

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:13.655
to allow metabolism to adapt
in a more acute setting.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.660
I want to say that time
scales matter for real biology

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.150
if you want to
understand physiology

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:24.880
and how it applies
to how metabolism

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.030
and physiology relate
to biology that you'll

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:30.220
encounter in other contexts.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.360
You realize that some
responses need to be acute.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.040
Those allow you to adapt
to conditions quickly,

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.760
be able to get enough ATP to run
away from the lion, et cetera.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.310
But you also need
adaptations that

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.560
work on longer time
scales, because it's

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.200
things like this that allow you
to enact programs that allow

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.950
you to adapt long-term to
whatever new conditions a cell

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:55.930
may face in its environment.

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:56.680
All right.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.970
Now, before I get into talking
exactly how these things

01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:03.610
actually work to
regulate glycolysis,

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:08.950
I want to discuss a few
details about regulation

01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:11.740
of pathways in general.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.590
And while we talked about these
with respect to glycolysis,

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:17.860
these points will end up
coming up over and over again

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.900
and really apply
to other pathways.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.650
Now I may not explicitly
point this out,

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:26.260
but the same considerations
for how glycolysis

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.540
works, how it's
regulated has to be

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.820
true for all metabolic pathways.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.770
And remember, any
pathway is just

01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:36.040
variations on relatively
few chemical--

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.340
chemistry reactions that
are repurposed in a way

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:44.300
to build some other thing
that's useful to the cell,

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.540
and you'll see this
over and over again.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:51.970
Now, it has to be
true for every pathway

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:55.180
that it has to be
thermodynamically favorable,

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.120
and that means either that
the pathway itself, glucose

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.600
to pyruvate, is
thermodynamically favorable,

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.720
or it's coupled to some
kind of energy input,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:11.030
like ATP hydrolysis that allows
the pathway to be favorable.

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:13.580
Every pathway is going
to be built in a way

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.220
that intermediates are
generated along the way that

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.410
allow that pathway to
accomplish its goals.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:21.230
In the case of glycolysis
it was the two steps

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:24.290
that allowed us to synthesize
and incorporate phosphate

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:27.260
despite the high
ATP-ADP ratio in cells.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.330
And in all cases
this has to obey

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:30.650
the laws of thermodynamics.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.950
That is, we have to obey
constant conservation of mass.

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:37.220
That means we have to account
for all carbon, all electrons,

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.110
delta G has to be less than
0 across the entire pathway.

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:45.920
You'll see that the
regulated steps will often

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.940
be those with the largest
thermodynamic considerations,

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.640
like the big drops
across hexokinase,

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.920
phosphofructokinase,
and pyruvate kinase.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.900
They'll often be at
the entrance and exits

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.640
to pathway because
you want to regulate,

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.350
you don't want to commit
something to a pathway

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:01.940
if you're not going
to use it, and you

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.408
want to match input and output.

01:13:04.408 --> 01:13:06.200
And all of this is
going to have regulation

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.540
that acts on both short
and long time scales

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:13.310
so it allows it to
match physiology.

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:14.240
All right.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.430
Now with that in mind,
now let's discuss

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:20.720
how we can regulate glycolysis
using both short and long time

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.190
scales as--

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.400
using really short time scales,
allosteric regulation of

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.790
glycolysis in a way that
makes it most useful to cells.

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:30.290
All right.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:37.490
So the first step
is uptake of glucose

01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:46.030
into the cell, which in animals,
like us, is passive, but can

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:51.730
still be regulated by glucose
transporters, often regulated

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.290
glute proteins.

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:55.420
And it's really these
glucose transporters

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.880
that can often determine
whether glucose is actually

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.680
taken up into cells.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.040
A famous example of this
is FDG PET scanning,

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.920
which is used to measure glucose
uptake into tissues in humans,

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.590
where basically a
hydroxyl group is replaced

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:13.240
with a positron-emitting
fluorine

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.320
atom, fluorodeoxyglucose, that
is taken up and phosphorylated

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.780
in cells, and it's
this lighting up

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.440
of this on a
positron-emitting scan

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.830
you can tell that which tissues
in the body take up glucose

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.020
and that's a property
of cancer, and so it

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.500
is often used as a way to
detect or stage cancer.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.840
Another example of
this is insulin.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.940
Basically one of
the major actions

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.360
of insulin on your tissues
is that when glucose is high,

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.460
your body makes more insulin.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.920
That causes glucose
transporters to be

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.490
put on the surface of
your muscle and your fat,

01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:51.340
which allows that glucose
now to get into those cells

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.500
and effectively
allows those cells

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.420
to dispose of the
glucose in the blood

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:59.270
and keep glucose in the
right physiological range.

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:01.750
And so uptake of glucose,
at least in animals,

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:06.880
is one important step that is
really controlled largely by

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.030
whether or not there is a
transporter on the surface.

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.530
All right.

01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:14.560
Once that's trapped as--

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.380
sorry, once it's in
the cell as glucose,

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.710
hexokinase then
traps that molecule

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:25.390
as glucose 6-phosphate.

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:28.510
And it turns out the
glucose 6-phosphate

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:34.240
is an inhibitor of hexokinase.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.170
Why is that?

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.780
Well, we will see
in the next lecture

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.560
that glucose 6-phosphate
can be turned

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.770
into glycogen in the
case of mammals or starch

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.400
in the case of plants.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.270
And so glucose 6-phosphate, if
you're going to store glucose,

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:51.340
you can ship it
off into glycogen,

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:56.350
or you could commit it
further down into glycolysis.

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.150
But if you don't need
it for a glycolysis

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:02.260
and your stores are full, you'll
build up glucose 6-phosphate,

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.710
you want to inhibit hexokinase
to keep things from flowing

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:08.060
through the system.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:17.030
The next step that's regulated
is phosphofructokinase.

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:21.175
So phosphofructokinase,
of course, makes FTP.

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:30.830
The step downstream of
that that's regulated

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:35.600
is pyruvate kinase,
PEP to pyruvate,

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:44.670
and it turns out that FTP will
stimulate pyruvate kinase,

01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:51.870
whereas PEP will inhibit
phosphofructokinase.

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:52.590
Makes sense.

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:54.760
You want to match
input to output.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.930
If you have a lot of
FTP, activate the enzyme

01:16:57.930 --> 01:16:59.170
to dispose of it.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:04.530
If you're building up PEP, tell
you to stop sending molecules

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:07.200
down the pipeline.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.360
It turns out, PFK is actually
the major regulatory step

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.880
of glycolysis,
because this is really

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.810
what commits that carbon
to going through glycolysis

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:22.720
as opposed to upstream of that,
it could be stored or not.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.710
So it's really that step
that's a commitment step.

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:28.230
And so it's also
regulated by some

01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:31.210
of the outputs of the pathway.

01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:40.027
And so some of those
outputs are ATP downstream

01:17:40.027 --> 01:17:42.360
of pyruvate, which we'll talk
about later in the course.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.890
There's some other molecules.

01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:47.820
Alanine, citrate.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:55.440
It turns out that high levels of
citrate will also inhibit PFK.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.780
High levels of ATP will
inhibit phosphofructokinase.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:11.740
Whereas high levels of AMP will
activate phosphofructokinase.

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:12.760
Makes sense.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.590
A major output of glycolysis is
to keep the ATP-ADP ratio high,

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:20.260
the energy charge
high in the cell.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.510
If the energy
charge is very high,

01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:25.930
high ATP, shut off
phosphofructokinase,

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:27.820
don't need to do
more glycolysis.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.120
If the energy charge
low, high AMP,

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.940
activate phosphofructokinase.

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.660
If production of other molecules
downstream like citrate

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:43.180
are high, come back
and stop sending things

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.100
into the pathway.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:50.260
Turns out, alanine can inhibit
pyruvate kinase, another step

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.910
downstream.

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:54.590
Great.

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:58.040
This is effectively
general regulation,

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.180
allosteric regulation
of how glycolysis works.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.700
And what I wrote is
was generally true

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.240
across different tissues, but
of course, these regulations

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.090
can be tweaked to be more
or less important to match

01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:14.460
physiology and function.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.100
Now I know many of you are
going to take the MCAT.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:21.030
And while I would never want
to teach just to take a test,

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:23.070
a couple of things
that you should

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:26.640
remember for that test
is phosphofructokinase

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.020
is a major regulator.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:32.400
Its big allosteric regulators
are AMP, as well as

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.150
ATP and citrate.

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:38.970
Whereas the other
steps, hexokinase,

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:41.280
you should know that it's
regulated by-- negatively

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.410
regulated by
glucose 6-phosphate,

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:49.740
and pyruvate kinase is
positively regulated by FBP.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.870
Now one other point
that I want to mention,

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:55.770
just because it will come
up sometimes on MCAT exams,

01:19:55.770 --> 01:20:00.270
is that there's an additional
detail about how PFK is

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.300
allosterically regulated, and
that's because there's this

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:07.380
side reaction where
fructose 6-phosphate can be

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:13.800
phosphorylated on the 2 rather
than the 1 position to make

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.430
this molecule, fructose
2,6-bisphosphate.

01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:22.680
This is a reaction that is
catalyzed by bifunctional

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.570
enzyme called PFK-2/FBPase.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.160
So basically phosphofructokinase
on the 2 position, FBPase,

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.250
we're moving it from the 2
position which allows you

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:41.190
to regulate the levels of
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:45.960
It turns out that PFK in
glycolysis, which, of course,

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:53.970
generates FBP, is positively
regulated by fructose

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.340
2,6-bisphosphate.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:01.080
And the production of fructose
2,6-bisphosphate is something

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.900
that can be inhibited
by ATP, inhibited

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:11.620
by phosphoenolpyruvate,
and activated by ATP.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:16.890
So exactly what is shown here
is allosteric regulation.

01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:20.970
Just some of this allosteric
regulation is via this side

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:22.590
enzyme to make a
separate product,

01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:26.130
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,
and there's control theory

01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:30.480
considerations for
why that might happen.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.980
All right.

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:37.410
So at this point, we've learned
how we can start with glucose,

01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:42.140
oxidase that glucose
via a pathway that

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:48.200
now allows us to get the energy
that cells need to maintain

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.580
ATP-ADP ratio in a good
physiological range

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:58.830
despite the high
ATP-ADP ratio in cells.

01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:04.290
However, it should also be clear
that in order for this to work,

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:07.490
we need a way to actually get
that glucose from somewhere

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.350
to begin with.

01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:11.570
You probably learned
in high school

01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:14.870
that plants use
photosynthesis as a way

01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:16.640
to get energy from the sun.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.680
Well, the synthesis
part of photosynthesis

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.530
is generating the sugar
that those plants can then

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:25.370
use to burn and keep
ATP-ADP high at night

01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:27.800
and survive the night until
the sun comes up again

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.460
when they can again use
energy from the sun directly

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.710
to get energy.

01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:37.070
We as animals evolve the way
that we have to eat the plants.

01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:40.090
We have to get the glucose
that the plants make,

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:43.550
but of course, we also use--

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:47.870
generate-- have the ability
to generate some glucose,

01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:53.030
and this is best illustrated
from muscle physiology.

01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:55.640
And that is, we
alluded to earlier,

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.210
that if we're running
away from the lion,

01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:05.730
our muscles might outstrip the
supply of oxygen in the blood

01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:09.620
and basically generate
a whole lot of lactate.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.950
Well, that lactate is
perfectly good fuel.

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:17.270
Just like the yeast, can oxidize
or we can reoxidize ethanol.

01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:20.900
We can also use lactate as
a fuel, but it turns out,

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:25.760
a big job of our liver
is to take that lactate

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.090
from the blood, as well
as other molecules,

01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:33.980
and regenerate glucose so
that our blood glucose remains

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:37.880
in a constant level.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.070
This cycling of
glucose and lactate

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:45.320
across the body between
the muscle and the liver

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.400
is sometimes referred
to as the Cori cycle

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.000
and involves a clear
set of reactions

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.960
to turn that lactate
back into glucose,

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.810
a process called
gluconeogenesis.

01:24:03.230 --> 01:24:06.950
And unfortunately we're
out of time today,

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:10.430
but next time I will
start off the lecture

01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:15.620
by going through how it is
that gluconeogenesis works

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:20.120
to turn something like
lactate back into glucose so

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.520
that organisms have
the glucose to begin

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.180
with to run glycolysis.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:28.030
Thank you.

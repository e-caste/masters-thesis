ROBERT GALLAGER: OK so today
we're going to review a little

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.820
bit Little's theorem--

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.350
we're going to review it a
little bit, but say a few new

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.710
things about it.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.120
I want to say something about
Markov chains and renewal

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.130
processes, because one of the
most valuable things about

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.810
understanding both is that you
can use renewal theory to

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.560
solve an extraordinary number of
Markov chain problems, and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.210
you can use Markov chains
to solve an awful

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.310
lot of renewal problems.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.980
And I want to make that clear
today because it's a trick

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.070
that you have perhaps seen in
the homework, or perhaps

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.770
you've missed it.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.670
If you missed it you've probably
done a lot of extra

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.010
work that you wouldn't have
had to do otherwise.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.320
But it's a very, useful thing.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.910
So it's worth understanding
it.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.340
Finally we'll talk a little
bit about delayed renewal

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.020
processes at the end.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.210
What we will say essentially is
there's a long section on

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.280
delayed renewal processes, which
goes through and does

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.840
everything we did for ordinary
renewal processes, and as far

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.990
as almost all the asymptotic
properties are concerned,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.980
they're exactly the same.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.100
It's just modifying a few of
the ideas a little bit.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.620
The essential thing there is
that when you're looking at

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.854
something asymptotically, and
the limit as t goes to

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:53.780
infinity, what happens in that
first little burst of time

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.330
doesn't really make much
difference anymore.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.810
So we will talk about that
if we get that far.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.770
OK, one of the main reasons
why convergence with

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.970
probability 1 is so important,
you've probably wondered why

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.020
we're spending so much time
talking about this, why we use

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.690
it so often?

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.630
I would like you get some idea
of why it is often much easier

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.850
to use than the convergence
of probability.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.420
So I'm going to give you
two examples of that.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.430
One of them is this initial
thing which we talked about in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.760
the notes also and I talked
about on lecture before.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.440
There's this nice theorem
which says that if the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.460
sequence of random variables
converges to some number--

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.470
alpha--

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.320
with probability 1, and if f of
x is a real valued function

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.110
of a real variable,
that's continuous,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.290
that x equals alpha.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.360
In other words, as you start
converging, as you get close

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.830
to alpha, this function
is continuous there.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.700
And since it's continuous there,
you have to get closer

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.410
and closer.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.550
That's the essence of that.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.930
So It says that then it's
function of zn, a function of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.320
a random variable, a real valued
function of a random

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.420
variable is also a
random variable.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.270
It converges with probability
1 to f of alpha.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.790
That was the thing we use to
get the strong law for

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.980
renewals, which says it's a
probability that the limit as

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.740
t goes to infinity of n of t of
omega over t is equal to 1

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.340
over x-bar with probability 1.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.940
In other words, the probability
of this set of

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.950
sample points for which this
limit exists is equal to 1

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.500
anytime you get confused by one
of these statements, that

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.760
says with probability 1, and by
now you're probably writing

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.400
this just as an add-on at the
end, and you often forget that

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.750
there's an awful lot tucked
into that statement.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.580
And I tried to put a
little of it there.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.529
Initially when we talked about
it we put more in, saying the

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.950
probability of the set of omega
such that this limit

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.800
exists is equal to 1.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.620
We state it in all sorts
of different ways.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.060
But always go back, and think
a little bit about what it's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.080
really saying.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.240
Random variables are
not like numbers.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.830
Random variables are far more
complicated things.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.270
Because of that they have
many more ways they

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.080
can approach limits.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.290
They have many more peculiar
features about them.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.630
But anyway, the fact that this
theorem holds true it is a

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.280
result of a little bit of
monkeying around with n

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.320
divided by the sum of n random
variables, and associating

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.910
that with an n of t over t.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.330
But it's also associated with
this function here.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.190
So you have the two things.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.770
The thing which is difficult
conceptually is this one here.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.320
So that's one place where we
used the strong law, where if

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.950
we try to state a weak law of
large numbers for renewals,

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.400
without being able to go from
this strong law to the weak

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800
law, it'd really be quite
hard to prove it.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.310
You can sit down and try to
prove it if you want to, and I

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.750
think you'll see that it
really isn't very easy.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.260
So strong law of renewals also
holds if the expected value of

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.840
x is equal to infinity.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.330
In this case, understanding
why this is true really

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.400
requires you to think pretty
deeply about random

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.000
variables--

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.640
and have an infinite
expectation

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.730
of what that means.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.480
But the idea here is since
x is a random variable--

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.300
in other words, it can't take
on infinite values--

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.220
except with probability 0.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.540
So it's always finite.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.910
So when you add a bunch of them
you get something which

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.180
is still finite.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.650
So that s sub n is a
random variable.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.960
In other words, if you look at
the probability that s sub n

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.830
is less than or equal to t, and
then you let t go off to

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.700
infinity, the fact that s sub
n is a random variable means

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.400
that the probability that
sn is less than or equal

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.680
to t goes to 1.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.420
And it does that for sample
values with probability 1 is a

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.816
better way to say it.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.850
Here I'm actually stating the
convergence in probability 2,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.110
because it follows from
the convergence

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.330
with probability 1.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.190
Since you have convergence with
probability 1, n of t

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.820
over t also converges in
probability, which says that

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.310
the probability as t goes to
infinity that n of t over t

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.220
minus 1 over x-bar magnitude
is greater than epsilon, is

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.470
equal to 0.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.520
That's this funny theorem we
proved about convergence with

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.740
probability 1.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.730
Set of random variables
implies convergence in

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.980
probability.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.060
Here's another theorem about
convergence which is called

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.680
the Elementary Renewal
Theorem.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.850
We talked about that, we
proved half of it.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.810
After we talked about talked
about Wald's equality.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.770
And we said the other half
really wasn't very

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.340
interesting.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.990
And I hope some of you at
least looked at that.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.270
After you look at it, it's a
bunch of mathematics, and a

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.740
bunch of equations.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.290
And it says this--

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.610
so we have three limits
theorems about n of t.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.570
About what happens when t gets
large there're this number of

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.210
renewals that occur, and
the time n of t.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.450
One of them is a strong
law, which is really

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.580
a sample path average.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.860
I'm trying to start using the
words sample path average

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.550
instead of time average because
I think it gives you a

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.590
better idea of what's
actually going on.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:29.230
But the strong law is really
a sample path argument.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.210
The weak law--

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.690
this thing here about
convergence and probability--

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.480
it still tells you quite a bit,
because it tells you that

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.400
as t it gets large, the
probability that n of t over t

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.210
can be significantly different
than one over

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.840
x-bar is going to 0.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.230
This in a sense tells
you even less.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.710
I mean why does this tell
you less than this does?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.120
What's significant thing does
this tell you that this

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.370
doesn't tell you?

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:14.060
Suppose we had a situation
where half the time with

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:22.200
probability 1/2 n of t over t is
equal to 2 over x4, and the

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.612
other half of the time
it's equal to 0.

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:27.480
That can't happen,
But according to

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.170
this it could happen.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.740
The expected value of
n of t over t would

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.840
still be 1 over x4.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.480
But this statement doesn't tell
you when you think about

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.900
whether n of t over t is really
squeezing down on 1 of

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.720
x-bar, it just tells you that
the expected value of it is

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.100
squeezing down on
1 over x-bar.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.950
So this is really a pretty weak
theorem, and you wonder

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.050
why people spend so much
time analyzing it?

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.680
I'll tell you why in
just a minute.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.060
And it's not it's not
a pretty story.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.320
We talked about residual life.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.840
I want to use this which I think
you all understand--

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.710
I mean for residual life, and
for duration and age you draw

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.240
this picture, and that
is perfectly clear

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.380
what's going on.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.170
So I don't think there's
any possibility of

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.090
confusion with that.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:32.660
Here's the original picture of
a sample path picture of a

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.030
rival apex, of the number of
arrivals up until time t

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.880
climbing up.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.640
And then we look at residual
life, the amount of time at

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.080
any time until the next
arrival comes.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.050
This is strictly a sample path
idea, for a particular sample

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:55.680
path, from 0 to infinity, you
look at the whole thing.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.890
In other words, think of setting
up an experiment.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:05.820
And this experiment you view
with the entire sample path

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.735
for this particular
sample point that

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.570
you're talking about.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.380
You don't stop at any time,
you just keep on going.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.170
Obviously you can't keep on
going forever, but you keep on

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.610
going long enough that you get
totally bored, and say well

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.840
I'm not interested in anything
after 20 years.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.620
And nobody will be interested
in my results if i wait more

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.080
than 20 years, and I'll
be dead if I wait

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.330
much slower than that.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.420
So you say we will take
this sample path

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.210
for a very long time.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.220
This is the sample
path that we get.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.340
We then argue that the integral
of y of t over t as a

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.360
sum of terms, this is a random
variable here. y of t is a

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.890
random variable.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.660
It's a number.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.420
If I put in a particular sample
point, each of these

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.300
terms here are random
variables.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.470
The sum of them is a
random variable.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.000
And if I put in a particular
sample point,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.400
it's a sum of numbers.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.910
Now, we did the following
thing with that--

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.710
I think it was pretty
straightforward.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.100
You look at what the sum
is up to n of t.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.840
In other words, for a particular
time that you're

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.710
looking at, the experiment that
you do is you integrate y

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.610
of t-- which is this residual
life function--

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.310
from 0 to t.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.880
At the same time, at time t
there's a certain number of

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.370
renewals that have occurred,
and you look at 1 over 2t

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.520
times the sum of x of n squared,
up to that point, not

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.940
counting this last little bit
of stuff here, and then you

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.960
upper bound it by this sum,
counting this little bit of

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.890
extra stuff here.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:59.110
And we pretty much proved in
class and in the notes that

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.840
this little extra thing at
the end doesn't make any

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.750
difference even if
it's very big.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.910
Because you're summing over such
a long period of time.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.090
That's one argument
involved there.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.560
The other argument involved is
really very hidden, and you

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.550
don't see it unless you write
things down very carefully.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.540
But it tells you why
the strong law of

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.490
numbers are so important.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.540
So I wanted to talk about
here a little bit.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.500
What that says--

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.290
I mean the thing that is kind
of fishy here, is here we're

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.310
summing up to n of t,
and we don't really

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.420
know what n of t is.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.820
It depends on how many arrivals
have occurred.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.740
And if you write this out
carefully as a sample path

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.970
statement what is it saying?

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.560
Let's go into the next
slide, and we'll

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.590
see what it's saying.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.280
For the sample point omega--

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.520
let's assume for the moment
that this limit exists--

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.700
what you're talking about is the
sum from n equals 1 up to

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.570
the number of arrivals that have
taken place up until time

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.440
t for this particular
sample point.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.100
And it's the sum of these
squares of these inner renewal

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.940
times, and we're dividing by
2t, because we want to find

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.440
the rate at which this
is all going on.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.370
We write it out then
as a limit.

00:14:35.218 --> 00:14:40.040
of x of n squared over omega
divided by n of t of omega,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.490
times n of t of omega,
divided by 2 2t.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.710
In other words, we simply
multiply and divide

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.740
by n of t in omega.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.440
Why do we want to do that?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.140
Because this expression here
looks very familiar.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.830
It's a sum of random
variables.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.680
With the sum of n of t of omega
random variables, but we

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.300
know that as t gets large, n of
t of omega gets large also.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.440
So that we know that with
probability 1, as t approaches

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.000
infinity, this sum here--

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.810
if we forget about that term--

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.400
this sum here by the
strong law of large

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.210
numbers is equal to--

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.460
well in fact by the weak
law of large numbers--

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:35.550
it is equal to the expected
value of x squared.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.012
If we take the limit of this
term, we get the limit of n of

00:15:40.012 --> 00:15:41.980
t of omega over 2t.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.110
The strong law for renewals
tells us that is equal to 1

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.270
over the expected value of x.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.460
So that gives us our answer.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:56.480
Now why can we take a limit over
this times this, and say

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.000
that that's equal to the
limit of this times

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.740
the limit of that?

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.510
If you're dealing with random
variables, that's not correct

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.430
in general.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.640
But here what we're
dealing with--

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.240
as soon as we put this omega in,
we're dealing with a sum

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.980
of numbers.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.560
And here we're dealing
with a number also.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.860
For every value of t,
this is the number.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.160
In other words, this is a
function of t numerical

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.050
function of t, a real valued
function of t.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.932
This is a real valued
function of t.

00:16:28.932 --> 00:16:34.490
And what do you know about the
limit of a product of two

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.380
sequences of real numbers?

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.400
If you know a little bit of
analysis, then you know that

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.400
you're going to take the limit
of a product, and take the

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.770
sequence of that limit, then the
answer that you get is the

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.660
first limit times the
second limit.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.200
OK?

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.000
I mean you might not recognize
the statement in that

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.630
generality, but if I ask
you what it is the sum

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.310
of a n times b n?

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:22.230
If we know that the limit of
a n is equal to say, a?

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:27.520
And the limit of b
n is equal to b?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.320
Then we know that this sum here,
in the limit the limit

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.860
is n to infinity, it's just
going to be a times b.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.670
And you're going to sit down and
argue that for yourselves

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.880
looking at the definition
of what a limit is.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.190
So it's not a complicated
thing.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.240
But you can't do that if you're
not dealing with a

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.740
sample path notion of
convergence here.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.840
You can't make that
connection.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.790
If you only want to deal with
the weak law of large numbers,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.350
if you want to say infinity
doesn't really make any sense

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.580
because it doesn't exist,
I can't wait that long.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.330
And therefore the strong
law of large numbers

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.770
doesn't make any sense.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.600
You can't go through that
argument, and you can't get

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.850
this very useful result
which says--

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.940
What was I trying to prove?

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.850
I was trying to prove that the
expected value of residual

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.040
life as a time average is equal
to the expected value of

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.530
x squared divided by 2 times
the expected value of x.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.200
This makes sense over
finite times.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.780
Yes?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.650
ROBERT GALLAGER: Yeah.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.470
No, I want to divide by n.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.726
And then I think that makes
it all right, OK?

00:18:55.726 --> 00:18:56.976
Something like that.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.448
Let's see, is that right
the way I have it now?

00:19:05.448 --> 00:19:06.698
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.525
ROBERT GALLAGER: Yeah I want
to do that, it's right too,

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:20.701
but if I want to take
the summation--

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:24.795
oh no, the summation makes
it messier, you're right.

00:19:24.795 --> 00:19:27.400
The thing I'm trying to state
is the limit as n goes to

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.790
infinity of an times
bn, is a times b.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.990
And there are restrictions
there, you can't have limit of

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.940
an going to 0 or something, and
the limit of bn going to

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.350
infinity, or strange
things like that.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.560
But what I'm arguing here--

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.650
I don't want you getting
involved with this because I

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.750
haven't really thought
about it.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.120
What I want you to think about
is the fact that you can use

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.620
the laws of analysis for real
numbers and whether you've

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.570
studied analysis or not, you're
all familiar with those

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.720
because you all use
them all the time.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.940
And when you're dealing with
the strong law of large

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.310
numbers, you can convert
everything down to a sample

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.320
path notion, and then you're
simply dealing with limits of

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.540
real numbers at that point.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.315
So you don't have to
do anything fancy.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:27.820
So this result would
be hard to do in

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.740
terms of ensemble averages.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.110
If you look at the end of
Chapter 4 in the notes, you

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.010
see that the arguments
there get very

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.570
tricky, and very involved.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.830
It does the same thing
eventually, but in a much

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.270
harder way.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.550
OK, for the sample point
omega, oh, we did that.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.300
OK, Residual life and duration
are examples of renewal reward

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.010
functions, so this is just
saying what we've already said

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.040
so let's not dwell
on it anymore.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.830
OK stopping trials.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.940
Stopping trials will
be on the quiz.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.060
The Wald equality will
be on the quiz.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.790
We will get solutions to problem
set seven back to you,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.850
although we won't get your
graded solutions back to you

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.840
before the quiz.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.700
I hope we'll get them
out tomorrow.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.720
I hope.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.400
Yes, we will.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.420
They will be on the web.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:37.390
Stopping trial is a positive
integer valued random variable

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:42.960
such as for each n, the
indicator random variable

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.670
indicator of j equals n.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.660
In other words, the random
variable which takes the value

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.970
1 if this random variable j is
equal to 1, takes the value of

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.560
0 otherwise.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.840
If that random variable is a
function of x1 up to x of n.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.670
If you look at x1 to x of n,
and you can tell from just

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.580
looking at that and not looking
at the future at all

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.720
whether you're going
to stop at time n.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.870
Then you call that
a stopping trial.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:17.600
And we generalize that to look
at a sequence x sub n, x sub 1

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.900
to x sub n and some other set
of random variables--

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.670
v sub 1 to v sub n.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.900
And the same argument.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.160
If the rule to stop is a rule
which is based on only what

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.520
you've seen up until time
n, then it's called

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.680
the stopping trial.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.950
Possibly the effect of stopping
trial it's the same

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.440
except that j might be a
defective random variable.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.600
In other words, there might be
some small probability that

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.220
you never stop, that you just
keep on going forever.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.560
When you look at one of these
problems, you use stopping

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.700
rules on, it's not immediately
evident before you start to

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.130
analyze it what do you
ever stop or not.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.570
So you have to analyze it
somewhat before you know

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.400
whether you're going to stop.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.890
So it's nice to do things in
terms of defective stopping

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.900
rules, because what you can
do there holds true

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.070
whether or not stop.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:17.790
Wald's equality then says if
these random variables or a

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:23.830
sequence, IID sequence they each
have a mean x-bar, and if

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:29.040
j is a stopping trial, and if
the expected value of j is

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.720
less than infinity--

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.140
in other words, if it exists--

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.680
then the sum at the stopping
trial satisfied--

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.840
the expected value of the sum
equals expected value of x

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.580
times the expected value of j.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.310
Those of you who did the
homework this week noticed

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.410
three examples of where this
is used not to find the

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.770
expected value of s sub j, but
where it's used to find the

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.610
expected value of j.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:03.420
And I guess 90% percent of the
examples I've seen do exactly

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.900
that you can find the expected
value of s of j very easily.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.190
I mean you have an experiment
where you keep going until

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.880
something happens.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.060
Something happens, this is the
sum of these random variables

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.460
reaches some limit.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.960
And when they reach the
limit you stop.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.950
If when they reach the limit
you stop, you know

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.750
what that limit is.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.010
You know what the expected value
of s sub j is, because

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.560
that's where you stop.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.370
And from that, if what x-bar
is you then know what the

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.170
expected value of j is.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.770
So we should really state it
as expected value of j is

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:43.160
equal to the expected value
of s sub j divided by the

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.120
expected value of x, because
that's where

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.370
you usually use it.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:57.820
OK this question of whether the
expected value of j has to

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.540
be less than infinity or not.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.260
If the random variable x you're
dealing with, is a

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.350
positive random variable, then
you don't need to worry about

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.280
that restriction.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.030
The only time when you have to
worry about this restriction

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.620
is where x can be both positive
and negative.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.530
And then you have to worry
about it a little bit.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.810
If you don't understand what I
just said, go back and look at

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.640
that example of stop
when you're ahead.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.280
Because the example of stop when
you're ahead, you can't

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.870
use Wald's equality there,
it doesn't apply.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.950
Because the expected amount of
time until you stop is equal

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.510
to infinity, and the random
variable has both positive and

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.930
negative values.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:47.790
And because of that, the whole
thing breaks down.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.040
OK.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.650
Let's talk a little bit about
Little's theorem.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.380
As we said last time, Little's
theorem is essentially an

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.630
accounting trick.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.250
I should tell you something
about how I got into teaching

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.390
this course.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.970
I got into teaching it because
I was working on

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.170
networks at the time.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.400
Queuing was essential
in networks.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.740
And mathematicians have taken
over the queuing field.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.070
And the results were so
complicated, I couldn't

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.140
understand them.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.970
So I started teaching it
as a way of trying

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.010
to understand them.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.770
And I looked at Little's
theorem, and like any

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.100
engineer, I said, aha.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.410
What's going on here is that the
sum of these waiting times

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.198
is equal to the integral of L of
t, the difference between A

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:44.360
of t and D of t,
as you proceed.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.480
So there's this equality here.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.840
If I look at this next
busy period, I

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.406
have that same equality.

00:26:53.406 --> 00:26:55.910
If I look at the next
busy period, I

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.810
have the same in equality.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.480
And anybody with any smidgen
of common sense knows that

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:08.180
that little amount of business
at the end, about that final

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.060
period, can't make
any difference.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.100
And because of that, Little's
theorem is just this

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.515
accounting equality.

00:27:15.515 --> 00:27:19.460
It says that the sum of the w's
is equal to the integral

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.520
of L. And that's all
there is to it.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.570
When you look at this more, and
you look at funny queuing

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.380
situations, you start to
realize that these busy

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.740
periods can take very long
periods of time.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.710
They might be infinite.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.870
All sorts of strange things
could happen.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.175
So you would like to be able
to prove something.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.520
Now, what happens when you try
to prove it, this is the other

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.430
reason why I ignored it when I
started teaching this course.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.070
Because I didn't understand
the strong

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.090
law of large numbers.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.020
I didn't understand
what it was.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.730
Nobody had ever told me that
this was a theorem about

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.300
sample values.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.270
So I tried to prove it.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.380
And I said the following
thing.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.160
The expected value of
L by definition is 1

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.700
over t times the limit.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.930
L is the number of customers
in the system at time t.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.340
So we're going to integrate the
number of customers in a

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.370
system over all this period t.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.630
And I'm going to divide
by 1 over t.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.650
Oh my God.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.020
Would you please interchange
that limit in the 1 over t?

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.320
I mean it's obvious when you
look at it, that has to be

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.570
what it is.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.960
And by this accounting identity,
this is equal to the

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.630
limit of this sum from I equals
zero to N of t or

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.180
w sub I over t.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.710
With this question of having
omitted this last little busy

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:01.100
period, whatever part of it
you're in when you get the t.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.980
I mean, that's the part
that's common sense.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.990
You know you can do that.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.180
Now lambda is equal to
the limit of 1 over

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.290
t times A of t.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:17.150
A of t is just the number of
arrivals up until time t.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.150
A of t, when we're doing
Little's theorem, counts this

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.770
fictitious arrival
at time zero.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.690
Or I should say that the
renewal theory omits as

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.670
fictitious the real arrival at
time zero, which is what's

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.260
going on in Little's theorem.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.240
So then the expected value of w
is going to be the limit as

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.930
t approaches infinity of 1 over
a of t times the sum of w

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.070
sub I. I'm going to break that
up in the same way I broke

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.950
this thing here up.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:59.360
It's the limit of t over a of
t times the limit of w sub I

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.250
from I equals 1 to
a of t, 1 over t.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:06.250
Breaking up this limit here
requires taking this sample

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.420
pass view again.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.210
In other words, you look at a
particular sample point omega.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:18.390
And for that particular sample
point omega, you simply had

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.130
the same thing as I
was saying here.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.110
And I don't know whether
I said it right or not.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.120
But anyway, that's
what we're using.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.420
It does work for real numbers.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:34.110
And therefore, what we wind up
with is this, which is 1 over

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:40.410
lambda, and this, which is the
expected value of L, from

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.460
this, from the accounting
identity.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:42.760
OK.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.790
So again, you're using the
strong law as a way to get

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.430
from random variables
to numbers.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.940
And you understand
how numbers work.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.720
OK, one more example
of this same idea.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:07.750
One of the problems in the
homework, problem set six are

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.210
problems I thought-- yes.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:14.290
AUDIENCE: About the previous
slide, that's from [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.290
right?

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.432
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

00:31:16.432 --> 00:31:17.916
Sorry.

00:31:17.916 --> 00:31:20.290
AUDIENCE: Then how--

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:25.420
is there an easy way to go from
there to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.334
distributions?

00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:29.010
PROFESSOR: Oh, to the
ensemble average.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.820
Yes, there is, but not
if you don't read the

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.950
rest of Chapter 4.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:39.050
And it's not something I'm going
to dwell on in class.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.300
It's---

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.620
it's something which is
mathematically messy and

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.750
fairly intricate.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:32:00.470
And in terms of common sense,
you realize it has to be true.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:04.250
I mean, if the ensemble average,
up until time t, is

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:10.580
approaching the limit, then you
must have the situation

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:16.990
that that limit is equal to
the sample path average.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.290
The question is whether it's
approaching a limit or not.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.290
And that's not too
hard to prove.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.980
But then you have all this
mathematics of going through

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:31.010
the details of it, which
in fact is tricky.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.600
OK.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.170
So back to mark up change
and renewal processes.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.310
You remember you went through a
rather tedious problem where

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.790
you were supposed to use
Chebyshev's inequality to

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.180
prove something.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.440
And maybe half of you recognized
that it would be

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.060
far easier to use Markov's
inequality.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:56.190
And if you did that, this is
what I'm trying to do here.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:00.160
The question is, if you look
at the expected amount of

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.350
time, from state I in a Markov
chain, until you return to

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:12.270
state I in the Markov chain
again, and you can do that by

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.770
this theory of attaching
rewards to

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.910
states in a Markov chain.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.920
What you wind up with is this
result that the expected

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:27.400
renewal time in an ergodic
Markov chain, is exactly equal

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.910
to 1 over the steady state
probability of that state.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.260
And if any of you find a simple
and obvious way to

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.420
prove that from the theory of
Markov chains, I would be

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.160
delighted to find it.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.270
Because I've never been able to
find any way of doing that

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.510
without going into
renewal theory.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.100
And renewal theory lets you
do it almost immediately.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.860
And it's a very useful
resolve.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.120
So the argument is
the following.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.840
You're going to let Y1, Y2,
and so forth be the

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.560
inter-renewal periods.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.080
Here we're looking at a sample
path point of view again.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.719
No, we're not.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.844
Y1, Y2 are the random variables
that are the

00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:15.010
inter-renewal periods.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.300
The elementary renewal theorem
is something we talked about.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.840
It says that the expected value
of n sub I of t divided

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:30.230
by t is equal to 1 over the
expected value of y.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:39.159
That's the elementary renewal
theorem for renewal theory.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:42.630
So we've stopped talking about
Markov chains now.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.080
We've said, for this Markov
chain, you can look at

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.060
recurrences from successive this
is to state I. That forms

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.429
a renewal process.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.840
And according to the elementary
renewal theorem for

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.710
renewal processes, this is
equal to 1 over y bar.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.200
Now we go back to Markov
chains again.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:09.790
Let's look at the probability of
being in state I at time t,

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:14.080
given that we were in state
I at time zero.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.520
That's the probability that n
sub I of t, minus n sub I of t

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.370
minus 1 is equal to 1.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:26.380
That's the probability that
there was an arrival at time

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.160
t, which in terms of this
renewal process means there

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.990
was a visit to state
I at time t.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:37.400
Every time you get to state
I, you call it a renewal.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.150
We've defined a renewal process
which gives you a

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:45.500
reward of 1 every time you hit
state I, and reward of zero

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.080
all the rest of the time.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.550
So this is equal to probability
of Ni of t minus

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.300
Ni of t minus 1.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.370
The probability that
that's equal to 1.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.865
So its expected value of N
sub I of t minus N sub

00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.670
I of t minus 1.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.420
That's the expected value.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.980
This is always greater than
or equal to this.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.570
This is either 1 or it's zero.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.860
You can't have two arrivals.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.190
You can't have two visits
at the same time.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.080
So you add up all
of these things.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.340
You sum this from n equals 1 up
to t, and what do you get?

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.810
You sum this, and it's
a telescoping series.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:31.470
So you add expected value of
n, 1 of t minus n 0 of t,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:36.390
which is 0, plus n2 of t minus
n1 of t, plus n3 of

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.060
t minus n2 of t.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:44.570
And everything cancels out
except the n sub I of t.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.980
The I here is just the state
we're looking at.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.810
We could've left it out.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:55.260
So p sub I, I of t, approaches
pi sub I exponentially.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.660
Because down there, very fast,
it stays very close.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:04.720
If we sum up over n of them, and
these are quantities which

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.330
are approaching this limit, pi
sub I, exponentially fast,

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.000
then the sum divided by the
number of terms we're summing

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.180
over is just pi sub I also.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.520
So what we have is a pi sub I
that's equal to this limit.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.190
That's equal to the expected
value of n sub I over t.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:27.770
The elementary renewal theorem
reads out, which is equal to 1

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:28.900
over y bar.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.070
So the expected recurrence time
for state I is equal to

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.870
pi sub I.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:39.230
If you look carefully at what
I've done there, I have

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.480
assumed that--

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:52.220
well, when I did it, I was
assuming it was an ergodic

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.690
Markov chain.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.080
I don't think I have
to assume that.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.790
I think it can be periodic,
and this is still true.

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:03.770
You can sort that out
for yourselves.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.110
That is the first slide I'll use
which says, whenever you

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.800
see a problem trying to prove
something about Markov chains

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.190
and you don't know how to prove
it right away, think

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.540
about renewal theory.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.930
The other one will say, whenever
you're thinking about

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.040
a problem in renewal theory, and
you don't see how to deal

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.730
with it immediately, think
about Markov chains.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.690
You can go back and forth
between the two of them.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.060
It's just like when
we were dealing

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.240
with Poisson processes.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.280
Again, in terms of solving
problems with Poisson

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.310
processes, what was
most useful?

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.650
It was this idea that you
could look at a Poisson

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.960
process in three
different ways.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.350
You could look at it as a sum
of exponential [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.700
arrival times.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.450
You could look at
it as somebody

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.750
throwing darts on a line.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.460
And you could look at it as a
Bernoulli process which is

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.150
shrunk down to time zero with
more and more arrivals.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.920
By being able to look at each
of the three ways, you can

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.760
solve pieces of the problem
using whichever one of these

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.340
things is most convenient.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.590
This is the same thing too.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:29.740
For renewal processes and Markov
chains, you can go back

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.050
and forth between what you know
about each of them, and

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.520
find things about the other.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.530
So it's a useful thing.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.210
Expected number of renewals.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.920
Expected number of renewals is
so important in renewal theory

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.810
that most people call it m of
t, which is the expected

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:53.020
value, of n of t.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.920
n of t, by definition, is the
number of renewals that have

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.820
occurred by time t.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.610
The elementary renewal theorem
says the limit, as t goes to

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.780
infinity, of expected value of
n of t over t is equal to 1

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.030
over x bar.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.100
Now, what happens here?

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.480
That's a very nice
limits theorem.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.660
But if you look at trying to
calculate the expected value

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:23.420
of n of t for finite t, there
are situations where you get a

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.790
real bloody mess.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.110
And one example of that is
supposedly in our arrival

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.330
interval, is 1 or the
square root of 2.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.350
Now, these are not rationally
related.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:43.560
So you start looking at
the times at which

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.490
renewals can occur.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:49.330
And it's any integer times 1,
plus any integer times the

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.770
square root of 2.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:56.860
So the number of possibilities
within a particular range is

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.870
growing with the square
of that range.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:04.040
So what you find, as t gets
very large, is possible

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.140
arrival instance are getting
more and more dense.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.180
There are more and more
times when possible

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.100
arrivals can occur.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.600
There's less and less structure
to the time between

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.850
those possible arrivals.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.900
And the magnitude of how much
the jump is at that possible

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.440
time, there's no nice
structure to that.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.960
Sometimes it's big, sometime
it's little.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.730
So m of t is going
to look like an

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.390
enormously jagged function.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.450
When you get out to some large
t, it's increasing.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:58.310
And you know by the elementary
renewal theory that this is

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.910
going to get close to a
straight line here.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.950
m of t over t is going
to be constant.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.650
But you have no idea of what the
fine structure of this is.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.760
The fine structure can be
extraordinarily complicated.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.200
And this bothered people, of
course, because it's always

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.480
bothersome when you start out
with a problem that looks very

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.290
simple, and you try to ask a
very simple question about it.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.110
And you get an enormously
complicated answer.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.050
So an enormous amount of work
has been done on this problem,

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.440
much more than it's worth.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.940
But we can't ignore it all
because it impacts on a lot of

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.290
other things.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:48.630
So if we forget about this kind
of situation here, where

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.610
the inter-arrival interval is
either 1 or something which is

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.860
irrational.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.670
If you look at an inter-arrival
interval, which

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:07.750
is continuous where you have
a probability density.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:11.360
And as a probability density is
very nicely defined, then

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.610
you can do things much
more easily.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:19.310
And what you do to do that is
you invent something called

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.360
the renewal equation.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.160
Or else you look in
a textbook and you

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.670
find the renewal equation.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.140
And you see how that's
derived.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:27.840
It's not hard.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.250
I'm not going to
go through it.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.220
Because it has very little to
do with what we're trying to

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.450
accomplish here.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.060
But what the renewal equation
says is that the expected

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:42.220
number of renewals up until time
t satisfies the equation.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:56.096
But it's the probability that x
is less than or equal to t.

00:43:56.096 --> 00:44:00.780
Plus a convolution here
of m of t minus x

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.090
times d f of x of x.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.900
If you state this in terms of
densities, it's easier to make

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.260
sense out of it.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.560
It's the interval from zero to
t, of 1 plus m of t minus x,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:18.020
all times the density of x dx
This first term here just goes

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:22.660
to 1 after t gets very large.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.820
So it's not very important.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.860
It's a transient term The
important part is this

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:33.820
convolution here, which tells
you how m of t is increasing.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:42.910
You look at that, and you say,
that looks very familiar.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.680
For electrical engineering
students who have ever studied

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.580
linear systems, that kind of
equation is what you spend

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.020
your life studying.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.170
At least it's what I used to
spend my life studying back

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.550
when they didn't know so much
about electric engineering.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:00.100
Now, there are too many
things to learn.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.600
So you might not know very
much about this.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.030
But this is a very common linear
equation in m of t.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.720
It's a differential.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.600
It's an integral equation
from which you can find

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.460
out what m of t is.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:18.010
You can think conceptually
of starting out at m of

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.880
0, which you know.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.350
And then you use this
equation to

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.370
build yourself up gradually.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.210
So you started m
of t equals 0.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:28.730
Then you look at m of t with
epsilon, where you get this

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:29.880
term here a little bit.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.670
And you break this all
up into intervals.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.680
And pretty soon, you find
something very messy

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.980
happening, which is why people
were interested in it.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:45.950
But it can be solved if
this density has a

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.200
rational or plus transform.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.900
Now I don't care about how
to solve that equation.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.410
That has nothing to do with
the rest of the course.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:59.150
But the solution has
the following form.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:04.170
The expected value of n
of t is going up with

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:08.610
t as 1 over x bar.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.400
I mean, you know it has
to be doing that.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.600
Because we know from the
elementary renewal theorem

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.770
that eventually the expected
value of n of t over t has to

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.580
look like 1 over x bar.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.950
So that's that term here,
m of t over t looks

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.510
like 1 over x bar.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.890
There's this next term, which
is a constant term, which is

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:38.720
sigma squared of x divided
by 2 times x bar squared.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.420
That looks sort of satisfying
because it's dimensionless.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.980
Minus 1/2, plus some function
here which is just a

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.680
transient, which goes away
as t gets large.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.030
Now you have to go through
some work to get this.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:58.780
But it's worthwhile to try to
interpret what this is saying

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.660
a little bit.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.700
This epsilon of t, it's
all this mess we

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.730
were visualizing here.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:11.000
Except of course, this result
doesn't apply to

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.700
messy things like this.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.970
That only applies to those very
simple functions that

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.310
circuit theory people
used to study.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.520
Because they were relevant for
inductors and capacitors and

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.665
resistors and that
kind of stuff.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.640
So we had this most
important term.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.810
We have this term, which
asymptotically goes away.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:39.240
And we have this term here,
which looks rather strange.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:46.860
Because what this is saying is
that this asymptotic form

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:59.930
here, m of t, as a function of
t, has this slope here, which

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.922
is 1 over x bar as the slope.

00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:06.490
Then it has something
added to it.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:15.230
This is 1 over x bar
plus some constant.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:19.460
And in this case, it's sigma
squared over 2 x bar

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.270
squared minus 1/2.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.960
If you notice what that sigma
squared over 2 x bar squared

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.620
minus 1/2 is for an
exponential random

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.150
variable, it's zero.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:40.420
So for an exponential random
variable which has no memory,

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.060
you're right back to this curve
here, which makes a

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.270
certain amount of sense.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:50.090
Because this is some kind of
transient at zero, which says

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:51.645
where you start out makes
a difference.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:58.000
Now, if you look at a--

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.380
I mean, I'm using this answer
for simple random variables

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.460
that I can understand just to
get some insight about this.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:12.560
But suppose you look at a random
variable, which is

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.810
deterministic.

00:49:16.443 --> 00:49:23.170
x equals 1 with probability 1.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.200
What are these renewals
look like then?

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.250
Start out here.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.140
No renewals for a while.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.440
Then you go up here.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.313
You're always underneath
this curve here.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.340
You look at a very heavy
tailed distribution

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:51.770
like this thing we--

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.430
you remember this
distribution?

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:58.280
Where you have x is equal to
epsilon with probability 1

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.650
minus epsilon, and that's equal
to 1 over epsilon with

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:02.820
probability epsilon.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:11.660
So that the sample functions
look like a whole bunch of

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.910
very quick.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.370
And then there's this
very long one.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:21.910
And then a lot of little
quick ones.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.070
We can look at what that's doing
as far as expected value

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.800
of n of t is concerned.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.020
You're going to get an enormous
number of arrivals.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.360
right at the beginning.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.770
And then you're going to go for
this long period of time

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.160
with nothing.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.010
So you're going to have this
term here, which is sticking--

00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:50.190
let's put you way up here.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.080
OK?

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:55.510
So that now you're starting out
because of this transient

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:59.430
that you're starting out at a
particular instant when you

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:02.810
don't know whether you're going
to get an epsilon or a 1

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:03.710
minus epsilon.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.060
You're not in one of these
periods where you're waiting

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.095
for this 1/epsilon
period to end.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.610
Then you get that term there.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:20.950
Then you get this epsilon of t,
which is just a term that

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:22.040
goes with y.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.380
OK so that's what this formula
is telling you.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.280
Want to talk a little bit about

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.380
Blackwell's theorem also.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.130
Mostly talking about things
today that we're

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.380
not going to prove.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:42.980
I mean, it's not necessary to
prove everything in your life.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.890
It's important to prove those
things which really give you

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:48.770
insight about the result.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.820
I'm actually going to prove
one form of Blackwell's

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.680
theorem today.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.830
And I'll prove it--

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.730
guess how I'm going
to prove it?

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.580
I mean, the theme of the lecture
today is if something

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.780
is puzzling in renewal theory,
use Markov chain theory.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.490
That's what I'm going to do.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:06.440
OK.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.420
What does Blackwell's
theorem say?

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.010
It says that the expected
renewal rate for large t is 1

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.282
over x bar.

00:52:16.282 --> 00:52:21.150
OK, it says that if I look at
a little tiny increment here

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:33.680
instead of this crazy curve
here, if I look way out after

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:41.430
years and years have gone by,
it says that I'm going to be

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:48.580
increasing at a rate which is
very, very close to nothing.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.530
I might be lifted up a little
bit or I might be lifted down

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:55.170
a little bit, but the amount
of change in some very tiny

00:52:55.170 --> 00:53:03.710
increment here of t
to t plus epsilon.

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:07.910
Blackwell's theorem tries to say
that the expected change

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:13.610
in this very tiny increment here
of size epsilon is equal

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:18.556
to 1 over x bar times epsilon.

00:53:18.556 --> 00:53:30.500
The expectation equals epsilon
over expected value of x.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.310
OK?

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.110
So it's saying what the
elementary renewal theorem

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:37.270
says, but something
a lot more.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:40.600
The elementary renewal theorem
says you take n of t, you

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.220
divide it by t.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.780
When you divide it by t, you
lose all the structure.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.620
That's why the elementary
renewal theorem is a fairly

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.810
simple statement
to understand.

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.290
Blackwell's theorem is not
getting rid of all the

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:58.250
structure, he's just looking at
what happens in this very

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.730
tiny increment here
and saying, it

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.120
behaves in this way.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:11.410
Now, you think about this and
you say, that's not possible.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.510
And it's not possible because
I've only stated half of

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:16.335
Blackwell's theorem.

00:54:16.335 --> 00:54:20.680
The other part of Blackwell's
theorem says if you have a

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.670
process that can only take jumps
at, say, integer times,

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:30.230
then this can only change
at integer times.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:33.070
And since it can only change at
integer time, I can't look

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.470
at things very close too,
I can't look at

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:36.960
epsilon very small.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.530
I can only look at intervals
which are multiples of that

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.060
change time.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:42.470
OK.

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:47.500
So that's what he's
trying to say.

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:57.990
But the other thing that he's
not saying, when I look at

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:03.900
this very tiny interval here
between t and t plus epsilon,

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:10.916
it looks like he's saying that
m of t has a density and that

00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:13.950
this density is 1 over x bar.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.710
And it can't have a
density, either.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:21.630
If I had any discrete random
variable at all, that discrete

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:26.190
random variable can only take
jumps at discrete times.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.990
So you can never have
a density here.

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:32.260
If you have a density to start
with, then maybe you have a

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.840
density after you're through.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.080
But you can't claim it.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.970
So all you can claim is that for
very small intervals, you

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:41.070
have this kind of change.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.590
You'll see that that's exactly
what his theorem says.

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:50.090
But when you make this
distinction between densities

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:55.890
and discrete, we still haven't
captured the whole thing.

00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:08.410
Because if the interarrival
interval is an integer random

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:11.500
variable, namely it can only
change at integer times, then

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.120
you know what has
to happen here.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.840
You can only have changes
at integer times.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:21.800
You can generalize that a little
bit by saying if every

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:29.950
possible value of the
inter-renewal interval is a

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:33.280
multiple of some constant,
then you just scale the

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.840
integers to be less
or greater.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.500
So the same thing happens.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.010
When you have these random
variables like we'll take one

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:47.080
value 1 or value square root of
2, then that's where this

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.060
thing gets very ugly and nothing
very nice happens.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:55.500
So Blackwell said fundamentally,
there are two

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.310
kinds of distribution
functions--

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.560
arithmetic and non-arithmetic.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.800
I would say there
are two kinds--

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.830
discrete and continuous.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.430
But he was a better
mathematician than that and he

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:13.090
thought this problem
through more.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:17.190
So he knew that he wanted to
lump all of the non-arithmetic

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:19.830
things together.

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:24.530
A random variable has an
arithmetic distribution if its

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:28.650
set of possible sample values
are integer multiples of some

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:30.610
number, say lambda.

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:35.690
In other words, if it's an
integer valued distribution

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:37.190
with some scaling on it.

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:39.420
That's what he's saying there.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:43.810
All the values are integers, but
you can scale the integers

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:48.080
bigger or less by multiplying
them by some number lambda.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.450
And the largest such choice of
lambda is called the "span of

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:55.690
the distribution." So that when
you look at m of t, what

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:59.280
you're going to find is when t
gets larger, only going to get

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.590
changes at this span value
and nothing else.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:08.660
So each time you have an integer
times lambda, you will

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.680
get a jump.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.450
And each time you don't have
an integer times lambda, it

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:15.000
has to stay constant.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.620
OK.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:22.740
So if x is arithmetic with span
lambda greater than 0,

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:28.130
then every sum of random
variables has to be arithmetic

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:34.260
with a span either lambda or an
integer multiple of lambda.

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:38.340
So n of t can increase only
at multiples of lambda.

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:43.670
If you have a non-arithmetic
discrete distribution like 1

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:48.820
and pi, the points at which n of
t can increase become dense

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.240
as t approaches infinity.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.810
Well, what we're doing here is
separating life into three

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.040
different kinds of things.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.990
Into arithmetic distributions,
which are like integer

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.470
distributions.

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:05.120
These awful things which are
like two possible values as

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:10.260
discrete, but they take values
which are not rational

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.700
compared with each other.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.030
Points at which n of t can
increase become dense.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:18.850
And finally, the third one is if
you have a density and then

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:21.260
you have something
very nice again.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:27.000
So what Blackwell's theorem says
is that limit as n goes

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.120
to infinity of m of t plus
lambda minus m of t is equal

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.580
to lambda divided by x bar.

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:38.640
OK?

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:42.120
This is if you have
an arithmetic x

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.000
and a span of lambda.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.130
This is what we were saying
should be the thing that

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:51.020
happens and Blackwell proved
that that is what happens.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:56.260
And he said that as t gets
very large, in fact, what

00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:01.290
happens here is that this
becomes very, very regular.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:04.320
Every span you get a little
jump which is equal to the

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.650
span size times the
expected increase.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:12.220
And then you go level for that
span interval and you go up a

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.470
little more.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:24.210
So that what you get in a limit
is a staircase function.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:35.162
And this is lambda here.

01:00:35.162 --> 01:00:41.231
And this is lambda times
1 over x bar here.

01:00:41.231 --> 01:00:42.830
OK?

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:48.220
And this might have this added
or subtracted thing that we

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.735
were talking about before.

01:00:50.735 --> 01:00:54.855
But in this interval, that's
the way it behaves.

01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:57.300
What he was saying for
non-arithmetic random

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:01.120
variables, even for this awful
thing like pi with probability

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:09.260
half and 1 with probability
half, he was saying pick any

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:16.750
delta that you want, 10 to the
minus 6, if the limit is t

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:21.840
goes to infinity of m of t plus
delta minus m of t is

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.950
equal to delta over x bar.

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:30.280
At density has this behavior,
but these awful things, like

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.410
this example we're looking
at, which gets very--

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.830
I mean, you have these points of
increase which are getting

01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:41.880
more and more dense and
increases which are more and

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.530
more random.

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:43.217
Yes.

01:01:43.217 --> 01:01:45.570
AUDIENCE: Is this true only for
x bar finite or is this

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:47.858
true even if x bar
is infinite?

01:01:47.858 --> 01:01:49.306
PROFESSOR: If x bar
is infinite?

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.580
I would guess it's true if x bar
is infinite because then

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.583
you're saying that you hardly
ever get increases.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.040
But I have to look at
it more carefully.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.470
I mean, if x bar is infinite,
it says that the limit is t

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:28.200
goes to infinity if this
difference here goes to 0.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.110
And it does.

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:34.970
So yes, it should hold true
then, but I certainly wouldn't

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:37.300
know how to prove it.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:41.440
And if you ask me what odds,
I would bet you $10 to

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.600
$1 that it's true.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.095
OK?

01:02:43.095 --> 01:02:44.345
[CHUCKLE].

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:51.020
OK.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:56.170
Blackwell's theorem uses very
difficult analysis and doesn't

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.460
lead to much insight.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.690
If you could code that properly,
I tried to read

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.760
proofs of Blackwell's theorem.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.640
I've tried to read Blackwell's
proof, and Blackwell is a guy

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.810
who writes extraordinarily well,
I've tried to read other

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:12.520
people's proof of it, and I've
never managed to get through

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:18.010
one of those proofs and say,
yes, I agree with that.

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:19.510
But maybe you can
go through them.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:20.902
It's hard to know.

01:03:20.902 --> 01:03:25.070
But I wouldn't recommend
it to anyone

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.910
except my worst enemies.

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:30.850
The hard case here is this
non-arithmetic but discrete

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.780
distributions.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:37.730
What I'm going to do is prove it
for you now as returns to a

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.140
given state in a Markov chain.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.410
In other words, if you have a
renewal interval which is

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:51.120
integer, you can only get
renewals at times 1, 2, 3, 4,

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.450
5, up to some finite limit.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:57.410
Then I claim you can always draw
a Markov chain for this.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:00.400
And if I can draw a Markov chain
for it, then I can solve

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.550
the problem.

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:06.450
And the answer that I get is a
surprisingly familiar result

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:11.060
for Markov chains and it proves
Blackwell's theorem for

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.310
that special case.

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:21.320
OK, so for any renewal process
with inter-renewals at a

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.130
finite set of integer times,
there's a corresponding Markov

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:28.370
chain which models returns
to state 0.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:31.210
I'm just going to pick
an arbitrary state 0.

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:34.560
I want to find the intervals
between successive

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.680
returns to state 0.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.070
And what I'm doing here in the
Markov chain is I start

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:42.320
off at state 0.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.790
The next thing that happens is
I might come back to state 0

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:50.600
in the next interval.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.680
One thinks it got passed
out to you, the

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.840
self-loop is not there.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.820
The self-loop really corresponds
to returns in time

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.210
1, so it should be there.

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:04.800
If you don't return in time 1,
then you're going to go off to

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.180
state 1, as we'll call it.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.600
From state 1, you can return
in one more time interval,

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.310
which means you get
back in time 2.

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:19.990
Here you get back in time 1,
here you get back in time 2,

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:24.380
here you get back in time 3,
here you get back in time 4,

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.380
and so forth.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.570
So you can always draw
a chain like this.

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.030
And the transition
probabilities--

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:35.970
nice homework problem would be
to show that the probability

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:43.370
of starting at i and going to
i plus 1 is exactly this.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:44.840
Why is it this?

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.830
Well, multiply this probability
by this

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:53.230
probability by this probability
by this

01:05:53.230 --> 01:06:06.270
probability, and what you get
is the probability that the

01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:09.480
return takes five
steps or more.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.450
You multiply this by this
by this by this.

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:17.050
Multiply this thing for
different values of i, and

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.920
what happens?

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.910
Successive terms--

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.470
this all cancels out.

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:27.780
So you wind up with 1 minus
piece of x of i

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.180
when you're all done.

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.100
Or i plus 1.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.580
OK?

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.850
Now here's the interesting
thing.

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:41.470
For a lazy person like me, it
doesn't make any difference

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:44.350
whether I've gotten this
formula right or not.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:47.430
I think I have it right,
but I don't care.

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.380
I've only done it right because
I know that some of

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.110
you would be worried about it
and some of you would think I

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:55.580
was ignorant if I didn't
show it to you.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.530
But it doesn't make
any difference.

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.900
When I get done writing down
that this is the Markov chain

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.440
that I'm interested in,
I look at this and I

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.480
say, this is ergodic.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.980
I can get from any state here
to any other state.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.910
I will also assume that it's
aperiodic because if it

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:18.990
weren't aperiodic, I would just
leave out the states 1,

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:23.183
3, 5, and so forth for that
period 2 and so forth.

01:07:23.183 --> 01:07:24.050
OK.

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.700
So then we know that the
limit is n goes to

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.390
infinity of p sub 00n.

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:33.530
In other words, the probability
of being in state

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:37.630
0 at time n given that you
were in state 0 at

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:41.540
time 0 is pi 0.

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.550
pi 0 I can calculate.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:48.130
If I'm careful enough
calculating this, I can also

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.150
calculate the steady state
probabilities here.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:57.100
Whether I'm careful here or not,
I know that after I get

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.160
rid of the periodicity here,
that I have something which is

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.280
ergodic here.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.830
So I know I can find
those pi's.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:10.830
Now, so we know that.

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:17.990
pi 0, we already saw earlier
today, is equal to 1 over the

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:22.740
expected renewal time between
visits to state 0.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:27.880
So with pi 0 equal to 1 over x
bar and this equal to pi 0,

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:32.090
the expected difference between
the probability

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:35.370
renewal of time n and the
probability renewal of time n

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:41.080
minus 1 is exactly 1 over x
bar, which is exactly what

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.317
Blackwell said.

01:08:42.317 --> 01:08:42.714
Yes.

01:08:42.714 --> 01:08:45.216
AUDIENCE: Can you please explain
why this proves the

01:08:45.216 --> 01:08:45.694
Blackwell theorem?

01:08:45.694 --> 01:08:48.090
I don't really see it.

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:51.060
PROFESSOR: Oh, I proved the
Blackwell theorem because what

01:08:51.060 --> 01:09:01.109
I've shown here is that as n
gets large, the probability

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:05.775
that you will be in state 0 at
time t given that you're in

01:09:05.775 --> 01:09:09.460
state 0 at time 0-- in other
words, I'm starting off this

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:12.210
renewal process in state 0.

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:20.029
So the probability of being in
state 0 at time n is really

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.229
exactly this thing that
Blackwell was talking about.

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:32.290
OK?

01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:33.800
Blackwell was saying--

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.040
I mean, lambda here is
1 because I've just

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.540
gotten rid of that.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:44.620
So the limit of m of t plus t
plus 1 minus m of t is the

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:50.380
expectation of a renewal
at time t plus 1.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.380
OK?

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.250
And that's 1 over x bar.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:02.770
AUDIENCE: So why is this renewal
process-- why is this

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:05.670
Markov chain model exactly
what we have in renewal?

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:09.370
So you're claiming that we have
a renewal if and only if

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.770
we return to state 0 in
this Markov chain.

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:12.265
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:12.265 --> 01:10:13.255
AUDIENCE: So that's the
thing I don't see.

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:15.525
Is it supposed to be obvious?

01:10:15.525 --> 01:10:16.775
PROFESSOR: Oh, you don't
see why that's true?

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:23.520
Let me try to do that.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.520
I thought that at least was
obvious, but as I found as I

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.840
try to develop this course,
things which are obvious are

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.340
the things which are
often not obvious.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.560
If I have a random variable,
let's say, which takes on the

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.330
value 1 with probability 1/2
and the probability 2 with

01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:54.610
probability 1/2 and I use that
as the inter-renewal time for

01:10:54.610 --> 01:11:01.670
a renewal process, then starting
off in time 0 with

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:08.180
probability 1/2, I will have a
renewal in time 1 and I will

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:13.530
have a renewal in time 2 with
probability 1/2 also.

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.210
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:17.070
PROFESSOR: That's exactly what
this says if I draw it for--

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:30.686
I don't need that.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:41.520
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.000
PROFESSOR: OK?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:42.960
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.880
Do you mind doing it for a
slightly more complicated

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.240
example just so it's easier
to see in full generality?

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.995
So it looks like [INAUDIBLE]
values or something.

01:11:51.995 --> 01:11:53.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:56.150
And then this won't be--

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.150
let's make this 1/2.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:01.490
And this 1/2.

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:02.940
OK.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.190
And this--

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:07.480
what is this going to be?

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.630
I mean, this has to be
1 at this point.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.950
AUDIENCE: So then this would
take on 1 with probability

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:20.742
1/2, 2 with probability 1/4,
and 3 with probability

01:12:20.742 --> 01:12:21.714
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:21.714 --> 01:12:23.172
PROFESSOR: I think so, yes.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.630
AUDIENCE: Good.

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:25.130
Thanks.

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:26.170
PROFESSOR: I mean, this is a
question of whether I've

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:28.850
calculated these numbers
right or not.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:32.620
And looking at this example,
I'm not at all sure I have.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:35.050
But as I say, it doesn't
make any difference.

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:40.350
I mean, so long as you buy the
fact that if I don't return in

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:45.230
time 0, then I'm in some
situation where it's already

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.030
taken me one unit of time, I'm
not through, I have to

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:54.790
continue and I keep continuing
and that's--

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.040
OK?

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.610
OK.

01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:00.020
And there's--

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.050
oh.

01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:04.250
I already explained delayed
renewal processes.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.360
I will explain it again.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.530
A delayed renewal process is
a modification of a renewal

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:16.010
process for which the first
inter-renewal interval x1 has

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:19.110
a different distribution
than the others.

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:23.905
And the intervals are all
independent of each other.

01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:28.800
So that the first interarrival
period might do anything.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.820
After that, they all
do the same thing.

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:35.710
And the argument here is if
you're looking at a limit

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.960
theorem that how long any--

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.100
if you're looking at the limit
of how many arrivals occur

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.210
over a very long period of time,
the amount of time it

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:51.350
takes this first arrival to
occur doesn't make any

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:52.360
difference.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.230
It occurs at some time.

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:57.150
And after that, it gets
amortized over an enormously

01:13:57.150 --> 01:14:00.550
long time which is going
to infinity.

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:04.030
So if it takes a year for the
first arrival to occur, I look

01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:06.590
at 1,000 years.

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:09.250
If it only takes me six months
for the first arrival to

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:14.330
occur, well, I still look at
1,000 years, but I mean, you

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:15.510
see the point.

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:19.220
This first interval becomes
unimportant compared with

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.910
everything else.

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:23.180
And because of that,
the strong law

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.430
still is going to hold.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:38.520
That says that convergencing
probability also occurs.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.490
All it does as far as m of t
is concerned, the expected

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:48.520
value of m of t, it moves it
up or moves it down, but

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.980
doesn't change the slope
of it and so forth.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.780
Even if the expected time for
the first renewal is infinite.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.200
And that sounds very strange,
but that still is true and

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.280
it's true by essentially
the same argument.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.470
You wait until the first
arrival occurs.

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.730
It has to occur at some point.

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.360
And after that, you can amortize
that over as long as

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.500
you want, you're just
looking at a limit.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.040
When you look at a limit, you
can take as long as you want

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.460
to, and you take long enough
that you wash out the stuff at

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.060
the beginning.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:28.400
I mean, if you told me
that, I would say

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.950
you're waving your arms.

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:37.190
But if you read the last section
of the notes and you

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:40.750
summarize it, that's exactly
how you will summarize it.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.000
OK.

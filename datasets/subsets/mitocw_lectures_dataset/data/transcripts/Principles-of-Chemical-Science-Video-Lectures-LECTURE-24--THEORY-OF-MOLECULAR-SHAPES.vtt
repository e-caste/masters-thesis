00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Today I would like to start by
discussing a timeline.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And you will see in a moment
what this timeline has to do

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with.
It is obviously only a partial

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
timeline.
But let's start here in 1916,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as we have done this semester,
by talking about the Lewis

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
theory of electronic structure.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And his electron pair theory is
something we are going to come

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
back to a couple of times during
lecture today.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's move on to 1954.
1954 was an important year in

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
electronic structure theory,
because in that year there was

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
awarded, to Linus Pauling,
the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Let me write down Pauling here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And if you are interested in
knowing something about what

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Pauling was awarded the Nobel
Prize in chemistry for,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I will show you over here on
the side boards.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What you are going to see here,
if you read this citation for

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Linus Carl Pauling in 1954 for
the Nobel Prize in chemistry,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
his prize was awarded
principally for his

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
contributions to our
understanding of the nature of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the chemical bond.
If you think back to the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
elegant title of the paper by
Lewis that we started out our

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
discussion of acid-base theory
with, it was a paper entitled

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
"The Atom and the Molecule." And
now we have gotten to Pauling,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in 1954, who is being awarded a
Nobel Prize in chemistry for the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
nature of the chemical bond.
That also is the title of a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
very famous chemistry book by
Linus Pauling entitled "The

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Nature of the Chemical Bond."
That was published by Cornell

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
University Press originally,
because it stemmed from his set

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of lectures at Cornell,
the Baker lectures,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
in the 1950s.
As we talk about electronic

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
structure theory,
I would like you to keep in

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
mind the way in which these
different geniuses were

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
approaching the problem,
a problem that we are going to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
launch in on today and spend the
next few lectures on.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We will move up here to 1966.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In 1966 there was awarded a
Nobel Prize to Mulliken.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Not to be confused with
Milliken.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We are going from 1954 to 1966.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You are going to find,
as you explore the Nobel Prize

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
website, that there are a lot of
informational links on these

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
people.
You can go and read

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
biographies.
You can read some of their

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
writings.
In the case of Linus Pauling,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you have links to all the pages
of all of his research

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
notebooks, spanning more than 60
years of research.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Those are pretty interesting
supportive materials.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
In the case of Robert S.
Mulliken, he is being cited for

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
his contributions to the
molecular orbital method,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
which we will also call the
molecular orbital theory.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We have the Lewis theory.
We have, in the case of

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Pauling, I am going to say the
nature of the chemical bond,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
described in terms of valance
bond theory.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
We will come back to that in a
moment.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And then, in the case of
Mulliken, we have a Nobel Prize

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
for molecular orbital theory.
And I just would like to show

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
you something kind of neat,
here.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This has to do with the fact
that if I go to the section

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
labeled other resources,
I can click on MIT digital

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
thesis library.
Then I can choose a page of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Mulliken's thesis to display.
And that is because Robert S.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Mulliken was Course 5 1917.
Let's hear it for Course 5

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
chemistry.
[APPLAUSE] Robert S.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Mulliken was one of you guys,
and he graduated in 1917.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
His undergraduate chemistry
thesis at MIT was entitled "The

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Effective Structure on the
Activity of the Hydroxyl Group

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
in Alcohols."
Submitted by Robert S.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Mulliken.
There is his signature.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Isn't it cool to have your
undergraduate thesis linked in

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
from the Nobel Prize website?
Robert S.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Mulliken for molecular orbital
theory.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And you can see,
even as you read his

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
undergraduate thesis,
he was talking about the effect

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of structure on the activity of
the hydroxyl group.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
He had the idea that if you
knew something about the

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
structure of the molecule,
even back then,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
you could make predictions
about the properties of the

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
molecule.
And that is what we really want

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to be able to do in chemistry,
because we want to be able to

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
control function as much as
possible.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I will take that way for now
and we'll come back in a moment

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
because I am going to mention to
you that in 1998 there was

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
another Nobel Prize given for
advances in our understanding of

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
electronic structure of
molecules.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And this one was a shared
prize, rather than these three

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
other ones that I mentioned.
Well, two others.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Lewis was neglected from that
category, unfortunately.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
In 1998 Kohn and Pople shared
the Nobel Prize for furthering

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
our understanding of how to
describe electronic structure of

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
molecules.
And this is a theory that we

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
are not going to be talking
about too much explicitly here

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in 5.112 this semester,
but if you go on in chemistry,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
you will be exposed to it more
and more.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
It is called density functional
theory.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It is one of the most expedient
ways to use computers to get

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
electronic structure information
about molecules.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And so, that method has become
extremely important.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I will just show you a
little piece of information from

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that website,
so we go to 1998.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And, under the John Pople
section, I am going to go to

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
interview.
He has given an interview on

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
different topics relating to his
involvement in chemistry.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
One short piece of that
interview is entitled "Interest

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
in Quantum Mechanics and
Development of Computer

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Techniques."
We are going to take a look at

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that and hopefully,
if the audio and video are both

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
working, you will be able to see
John Pople talking a little bit

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
about this important area of
chemistry.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We just don't have time for
fixing audio/video problems in

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
real-time here,
unfortunately.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Therefore, what I would like
you to do is go to

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
NobelPrize.org,
Chemistry Laureates on Pople,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and actually watch that
five-minute segment of his

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
interview that has to do with
his feelings about electronic

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
structure theory and advice to
students on that topic.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And I will summarize his
comments here --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
-- by saying that the goal of
studying electronic structure of

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
molecules is to try to get
predictive power about molecular

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
systems.
And we want predictive power in

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
terms of the 3D structure of
molecules.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We know how to represent
connectivity in molecules in two

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
dimensions.
We have been doing that already

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
quite a bit this semester.
But we would like to know,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
if you know which atoms are
bonded to which.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And then how does that
translate into the intricate

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
three-dimensional structures
that molecules can have?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Also, molecules can have color.
That is an important property

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
of a molecular system.
In addition to which,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
molecules can be magnetic.
So, magnetism is one of the

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
important properties of
molecular systems.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And, as they aggregate into
extended solid materials,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
the way in which magnetic
molecules interact to produce

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
macroscopic magnetic phenomena
is very much an area of interest

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to chemists.
People want to design molecular

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
magnets in order to be able to
make materials that have desired

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
properties that will be useful
to us in building things.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And then, of course,
we have molecules that are

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
redox-active.
And redox properties are very

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
important.
We would like to be able to sit

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
down with our computer and draw
out a structure.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We would like to be able to pop
it into its optimum 3D geometry

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and find out what that is.
We would like to then know how

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
easy is it to remove an electron
from that system or how easy it

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is to add an electron to that
system.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Can we sit down and,
right from the start,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
use theory to predict
properties like the energies

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
associated with electron
transfer to and from a molecular

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
system?
That would be important if we

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
are going to do what I talked
about last time in terms of

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
inventing systems to transform
light energy into chemical

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
energy in terms of the water
splitting reaction I discussed

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
last time.
Also, molecules have acid-base

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
chemistry.
And this is one of the most

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
pervasive forms of chemical
reactivity that we can discuss.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And so, we really have been
talking, so far in my lectures,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
about redox chemistry and
acid-base chemistry.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And, as I go on,
during the next few lectures,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
we are going to be also talking
about properties like color and

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
magnetism and 3D structure from
theoretical considerations.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Acid-base is one type of
reactivity, but then also there

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
are all kinds of different modes
of reactivity that can be

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
classified in different ways.
Just to give you an example,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
there is a class of reactions
in organic chemistry called

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
electrocyclic reactions.
We will be talking a little bit

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
about reactions of that sort.
And then there is something

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that Professor Ceyer referred to
earlier in the semester as

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
stability and the idea that this
can take on both kinetic and

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
thermodynamic forms.
And so, we would want,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
from first principles,
to be able to sit down and

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
consider a molecular system
composed of whatever elements

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
from whatever part of the
periodic table it is composed,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and just how these properties
follow naturally from the

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
collection of elements that you
have put together into a

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
molecule.
This is really chemistry and

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
this is what we would like to be
able to do.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
In this next part,
what I would like to do is just

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
spend a little time right here
in 1957 because that is when

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Ronald Gillespie published his
VSEPR theory.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Ronald Gillespie is now kind of
in the twilight of his career.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
He has published on his
"Lifetime in Chemistry." And so,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
you can Google Ronald Gillespie
and find information about him

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and his VSEPR theory that will
go well beyond what you will

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
find in that section devoted to
it in your textbook.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
This VSEPR theory,
it is an acronym.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And it stands for Valance-Shell
Electron-Pair Repulsion theory.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I tell you, the closer you get
to the board the less easily you

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
can see the things on that
board.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
When we talk about VSEPR
theory, Ronald Gillespie

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
formulates it simply in terms of
five basic considerations.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
The first of these,
you can tell very easily from

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the name, and that is that
electron pairs repel each other.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And note here I am underlining
the word "pairs." And that is

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
because we know that electrons
are all negatively charged

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
particles.
And so they should all

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
individually repel each other.
And they do,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
in fact.
But, based on the ideas of

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Lewis, you will see that
Gillespie is formulating this

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
theory, taking the notion of the
electron pair as the fundamental

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
unit to consider.
And he is saying that electron

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
pairs are somehow organized in
space in a manner that they

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
repel each other,
and they try to occupy

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
different regions of space from
one another.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And this is going to be useful
in terms of predicting the 3D

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
structure of molecules,
and this is what this theory is

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
devoted to.
And, two molecules can have

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
single bonds,
or they can have double bonds,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
or they can have triple bonds
between pairs of atoms.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Maybe we will see this semester
also that molecules can have

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
quadruple bonds between pairs of
atoms if the orbitals are

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
available for that.
But in the VSEPR theory,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
in this context multiple bonds
are treated like single bonds.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
You might suspect that that
type of approximation is a

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
little crude and that it might
lead to certain guesses that

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
might turn out not to be quite
right, but actually it is a

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
useful enough approximation for
the prediction of the

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
three-dimensional structures of
a lot of different molecules

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
that we are actually going to
adopt for the purposes of our

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
treatment of VSEPR theory.
Number three:

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
if you have multiple central
atoms, --

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
- they are treated
independently.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And you will see what I mean by
that in a moment.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
You should see,
from that statement,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
that in the context of VSEPR
theory, we are going to be

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
trying to identify central atoms
and peripheral atoms that are

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
attached all to the central
atom.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And there may be one or more
central atoms in a molecule that

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
themselves are interconnected.
And, four, we have two kinds of

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
electron pairs that we consider
in VSEPR theory.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
We have lone pairs,
and we have bond pairs.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And lone pairs occupy more
space --

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
-- than bond pairs do.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And we will discuss the reason
for that in a moment.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Finally, I want to give you
rule number five for 3D

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
structure prediction using
VSEPR.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
That is that lone pairs are not
included in the description of

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
the structure.
And you will see what I mean by

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
that in a moment.
The idea is that the names that

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
we give to different molecular
structures have to do with the

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
3D arrangement in space of the
nuclei only and not the

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
electrons.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
The lone pairs are not included
in the structure description.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
This is reserved for the
nuclei.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Now, let's do a couple of
examples.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And, in introducing these
examples, I will also be giving

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
you some more of the shorthand
that is associated with VSEPR

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
treatment of molecular
structure.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Let's talk about this one here.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I have drawn here a very simple
Lewis dot structure for a

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
hydrogen sulfide molecule,
H2S.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And for a molecule like this,
we really only have two

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
possibilities for the structure
because you have three nuclei.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And so, either they can all be
arranged -- we are going to

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
assume that nuclei are not going
to fuse together and be one on

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
top of another because those
positively charged nuclei do

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
indeed repel each other very
successfully -- and so,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
therefore, we could either have
a linear or a bent structure.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And we can approach that
question using the VSEPR theory

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
very nicely.
We start out by recognizing

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
that we have two lone pairs.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
That would be this one and this
one in the Lewis dot structure

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
that are not interacting with
both hydrogen and sulfur nuclei.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And we will call those E.
And then we have two bond

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
pairs.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
And we will refer to those each
as X.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And then we have a single
central atom.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000
We have a central sulfur atom.
And the central atom is usually

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000
given the label A.
And so, that means that we have

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.000
a system here of the type AX two
E two.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And if you look at the general
class of molecules of the type

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
AX two E two,
it turns out that we can draw

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
their structures this way.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
What I am trying to indicate in
this structure is that one of

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
these lone pairs is coming up
and out of the board this way

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and the other one is going back
behind the board the other way.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
These are our two bond pairs
that I am representing as lines.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Bond pairs occupy less space
than lone pairs do,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
and that is because you have
two electrons interacting with

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
two positively charged nuclei.
Whereas, in the case of a lone

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
pair, you have a single pair of
electrons interacting only with

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
a singly positively charged
nuclei.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Two nuclei cause a greater
localization in space of bond

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
pairs, as compared with lone
pairs.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And the angle here that this
vector associated with the lone

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
pair direction makes to the
hydrogen is something

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
approximately tetrahedral.
Actually, probably larger than

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
tetrahedral in this case because
the H-S-H angle is smaller than

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
tetrahedral in H two S.
But this is an angle certainly

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
greater than 90 degrees.
And that is one of our angles

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
of the type E-A-X that describes
the interaction of a lone pair

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
with a bond pair.
What we want to do is maximize

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
those E-A-E and E-A-X angles
because, as I was saying

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
earlier, a lone pair of
electrons requires a greater

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
amount of space than does a bond
pair of electrons.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
The magnitude of the
repulsions, if we get back to

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
the word repulsion in the name
of this theory,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
the greatest repulsions are
found between lone pairs.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And so, next we have repulsions
between lone pairs and bond

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
pairs.
And then, finally,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
the weakest repulsions in the
system will be between bond

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
pairs.
And so, the best

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
three-dimensional structure
given by this theory is that

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
which minimizes these different
repulsions in the system.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
If we considered the linear
structure, then what we would

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
have to do is put all the
electrons in the same plane of

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
the molecule.
And these angles here would

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
have to be 90.
And, overall,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
this would be a higher energy
structure because of the

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
necessity of putting in an E
lone pair at 90 degrees to a

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
couple of bond pairs and so on
around the molecule.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Three dimensionally in space,
this quasi-tetrahedral geometry

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
gets the four pairs of electrons
of the molecule the farthest

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
apart in space and minimizes
electron pair repulsion.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And that leads,
therefore, to a description of

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
the structure as bent.
The structure is called bent

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
rather than tetrahedral because
we include only the nuclei in

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
the way that we refer to the
structure of the molecule.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And we do not include those
electron pairs.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Let me give you a feel for how
this looks.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And in this picture that I am
going to show you,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
which will recall to mind some
that I showed you in my first

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
couple of lectures,
you will see that what I have

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
here is an electron density
isosurface for the H two S

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
molecule.
And you can see here one of the

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
S-H bonds.
Here is another S-H bond.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Over here is that region in
space where the electron density

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
isosurface is associated with
lone pairs.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And you can see that certainly
the electron density is a lot

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
more tightly contracted in the
region between the sulfurs and

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
the hydrogens than it is
elsewhere, where it bulges out.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
And you can see that effect of
getting the eight valance

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
electrons in this molecule as
far apart from each other in

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
space as you can.
And then, furthermore,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
the coloring in this diagram
represents the propensity of

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
electrons at that point in space
to come together as pairs.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
In effect, that coloring is the
three-dimensional manifestation

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
of the Pauli principle mapped
onto an electron density

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
isosurface for the H two S
*molecule.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
This type of picture is very
nicely associated with the VSEPR

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
representation of molecular
structure.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And I am going to go through
another example.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
I am numbering this off so as
not to distract you with that

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
picture.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
This next example is SF four.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Let me draw out a Lewis dot
structure of this.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
As you are looking at this
Lewis dot structure,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
one of the things you should do
is to see if the number of

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
electrons that I am including in
my drawing is,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
in fact, the correct number of
valance electrons for this

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
system.
And that is easy to do.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
You know that fluorine is in
Group 19 of the Periodic Table.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
You know that sulfur is in
Group 6 of the Periodic Table.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And so you can quickly figure
out how many valance electrons

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
there should be.
And, hopefully,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I have indicated all of them on
my drawing, and no more than all

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
of them.
What you might not like about a

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
drawing like this is that while
each fluorine has been

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
represented as an octet,
as being associated with eight

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
electrons, four pairs of
electrons, the central sulfur

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
atom seems to be,
in this drawing,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
associated with ten electrons,
--

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
-- doesn't it?
That seems to be a violation of

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
the octet rule.
And I will defer that

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
observation for now,
but it is an interesting

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
feature of this.
And, when you do yourself write

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
down Lewis structures as a
prelude to subjecting them to

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
the valence bond theory of
Pauling or to the valence shell

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
electron pair repulsion theory
of Gillespie or the molecular

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
orbital theory of Mulliken or
the density functional theory of

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Kohn and Pople,
you should be sticking with the

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
basics here and making sure you
are working with the right

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
number of valance electrons --
-- because your whole initial

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
description of the molecular
system is going to revolve

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
around the correct distribution
in space of this number of

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
valance electrons that these
atoms that you are including in

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
the molecule bring into play.
And then you are going to see

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
if you can predict properties
based on that.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:12.000
That is what we do first.
And, in terms of bond pairs,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000
based on that structure,
we have four.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And, in terms of lone pairs,
we have one.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Therefore, the type of system
that we are working with here is

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
AX four E.
This is one of the possible

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
types, when you have five units,
surrounding a central atom.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And the most typical type of
geometry that arises when we

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
have five units surrounding a
central atom is as follows.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
The atom A at the center is
intended to be here.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And then I am going to draw
five balls.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
You can think of them as
representing either lone pairs

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
or fluorine atoms.
And I am going to color two of

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
them to distinguish them from
the others.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
And this structure is called
TBP.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:41.000
And that standards for trigonal
bipyramidal.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
And the reason I have colored
this type different from that

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
type is that in a trigonal
bipyramidal structure,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
there are two possible
environments,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
either for a lone pair of
electrons or for a bond pair of

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
electrons.
You can have axial,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
and the axial position is
easily distinguished from the

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
equatorial position --

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
-- by virtue of the fact that
an atom or a lone pair in the

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
axial position makes 90 degree
angles, three of them to its

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
neighbors.
Whereas, an atom in the

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
equatorial position makes two 90
degree angles with respect to

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
its neighbors.
It is three versus two that

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
will help you distinguish axial
from equatorial.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And understanding that about
this molecular geometry,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
you can see that for the SF
four molecule there are

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
two possibilities.
Note that when I am drawing a

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
wedge here that means that the
atom connected to the central

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
atom is coming out of the plane
at us.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
And the dashed bond means that
it is going back behind the

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
plane so that viewed from the
top, this thing would look

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
simply like a Mercedes Benz
symbol, just to understand that

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
about the wedges and dash
nomenclature on these systems.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And so, the two possibilities
that we have for our system is,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
we can either put our lone pair
E up here and our four bond

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
pairs X down here.
Or, we can have the lone pair

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
equatorial and our bond pairs,
two of them axial and two of

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
them equatorial.
As in the case of H two S,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
we had two structures
to distinguish between linear

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
and bent.
Over here, we have a structure

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
with an equatorial lone pair or
with an axial lone pair for SF

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
four.
And when you look at the top

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
one and realize that you have
only two of these very bad lone

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
pair-bond pair contacts at 90
degrees, whereas,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
on the bottom one we have three
of these bad lone pair-bond pair

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
contacts at 90 degrees,
you might be inclined to pick,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
in fact, this top one.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
And that would be right because
it minimizes the number of the

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
worst kind of repulsions.
In this case,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
lone pair bond pair at 90
degrees.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
And when we give this structure
a name, we are not going to call

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
it trigonal bipyramidal because
we do not include the lone pair.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
We only include the positions
of the nuclei in the naming of

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
the molecular structure.
This one is called a seesaw.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Some of you may be aware that
there is a piece of playground

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
equipment known as a seesaw.
You probably don't get a chance

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
to play on them anymore very
much.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Neither do I.
This is more fun,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
anyway.
And what I am showing you now

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
on these side screens is a
picture of the electron density

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
isosurface for the SF four
molecule.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
And hopefully,
you can see that it looks like

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
a seesaw.
These two fluorines down here

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
would be the legs of the seesaw.
And then you would sit either

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
here or here and then lean
forward and put your hands on

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
the lone pair and then rock up
and down somehow.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
I don't know.
Anyway.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
In this system,
you should be able to see that

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
the lone pair on the sulfur,
which is here,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
is definitely in this
equatorial position,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
so the electro-density
isosurface has a nice dark-blue

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
color where we find that lone
pair on the sulfur.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
And then the four flourines are
organized, according to the

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
predictions of VSEPR theory,
with these 90 degree angles to

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
the flourines that are oriented
in the axial.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
The two flourines are axial.
And then here is our two

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
equatorial flourines here
spinning around in the belt of

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
this system.
We could also say that you

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
would be sitting on the axial
positions if you were going to

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
ride on this particular seesaw.
Now, I would like to proceed in

00:38:55.659 --> 00:32:34.000
time briefly back from '57 to

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Because we need to discuss some
of the issues of the valance

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
bond theory that Pauling brought
into the quantum mechanical

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
treatment of molecules.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
What I am representing here are
a couple of hydrogen atoms 1S

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
orbitals at a distance.
We have (H)A 1s and we have the

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
1s of hydrogen labeled B.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And we are going to say that at
some infinite separation between

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
the two, they would not really
know much about the spin of the

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
electron on the partner
hydrogen.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
But as we bring them close
together, the spin is going to

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
become very important.
And that is by virtue of the

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Pauli principle.
And you should remember that

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
one of the ways of formulating
the Pauli principle is that no

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
two electrons in a quantum
mechanical system can have the

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
same set of four quantum
numbers.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
As these two hydrogens get
close together,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
the stable situation for the
electrons coming from the two

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
have opposite spin,
so I am drawing with spin-up

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
and one with spin-down.
And then you are going to

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
notice that here in the center
of our H two molecule,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
now, is a region of overlap and
of constructive interference of

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
those 1s-orbital wave functions
from the two sides.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
In this representation of the
ground state of the molecule,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
the Pauli principle is
satisfied.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
And we can put this pair of
electrons into an orbital.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
And when that orbital is
represented that way,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
it is cylindrically symmetric.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And we call that a sigma bond.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
In chemistry we talk often
about the properties of sigma

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
bonds.
We talk about also the

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
properties of things called pi
bonds.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And we can even have delta
bonds.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Just as I was talking about
bond multiplicity a moment ago

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
with reference to VSEPR,
let me give you here an

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
x,y-plane.
I am drawing in perspective an

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
x,y-plane.
And in this x,y-plane we are

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000
going to have,
actually, six atomic nuclei.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
And our z direction is
perpendicular to this plane

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
drawn in perspective.
And I am drawing in here the

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
positions of four hydrogen and
two carbon nuclei.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And when I draw them in like
that, you are going to see that

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000
all the valence orbitals of this
system, except for two,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
lie in that x,y-plane.
And the two that lie out of

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
that x,y-plane,
I will show you here,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
are p orbitals that go above
and below the plane.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
And I am shading in the
negative phase lobe of these pz

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
orbitals.
This is pz from carbon A and

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
this is a pz from carbon B.
And you can see that these are

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
oriented in a side-on fashion,
so that the overlap area that

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
can occur is a side-to-side
overlap of two neighboring P

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
orbitals, like this.
And the distinguishing feature

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
here, as compared to my
description of the sigma bond

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
over there, is that it is not
cylindrically symmetric.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
This bond has a nodal surface,
which is the x,y-plane,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:09.000
where the phase changes as you
pass from above that plane to

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
below that plane.
We have a nodal surface,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
a node containing the
internuclear axis.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
The type of bond that I have
drawn there is distinct from a

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
sigma bond.
It is a pi bond.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
That bond over there,
the sigma bond,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
has no nodal surfaces passing
through the internuclear axis.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
If I draw the internuclear axis
here, you can see that it has

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
the same phase no matter where
you are with respect to that

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
axis.
Plus, plus, plus everywhere.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
And here, if these lobes of
these two pz orbitals are

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
considered to be positive in the
positive z direction,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
then as we go this way,
we pass through the x,y-plane

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
and get down into negative z.
We now have negative phase,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
as indicated by the purple
shading down here.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
The fact that that happens only
once with respect to this

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
internuclear axis is what tells
us that it is a pi bond.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
If there were two such nodal
surfaces, then we would have a

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
delta bond, and so on.
And next time,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
we are going to start talking
about the progression from these

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
ideas onto hybridization.
And then from there onto

00:45:33.743 --> 00:45:36.000
molecular orbital theory.

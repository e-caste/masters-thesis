00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.560
We talked about how
wonderfully quick

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.050
it is to use the mobile
devices and that's

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.820
one of the things that's
so terrific about it.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.210
But the camera in
most of the devices

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.100
are not only low resolution,
which is a problem,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.040
but they're also very
wide angle lenses

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.090
so we have a lot of distortion
in most of the images

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.480
when we see it in a
particular kind of image

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.150
as we're doing here.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.140
When I quickly made this
image in our provost's office,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.480
in fact, I was
very lucky that he

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.610
wanted to hang some of the
pictures I made of his work

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.440
from years ago in his office.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.470
And I had about 30 seconds to
make the image showing the,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.590
let's call it "art" at
this point, on the walls.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.850
And you see that the
image has problems.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.070
It's distorted, because of
the nature of the camera.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.480
So what I did was I
selected the image

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.450
and then I went
to image distort,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.560
where I then tried
to undistort it.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.090
I placed the grid on top to
help me figure out actually

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.470
exactly how much
to move the image,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.039
and played around a
little bit, and then I

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.930
think I pretty much got it.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.100
I went to the
cropping tool to make

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.270
it as symmetrical as possible.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.160
And I think that after these
couple of manipulations,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.500
we can get a more
straightforward image,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.570
just moving your things
around a little bit

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.520
and just trying to make it a
truly symmetrical image, which

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.160
I think we did here.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.550
And I want you to just take
a look at the first image

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.770
that I made and then
compare it to be more

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.460
undistorted or fixed image.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.190
And this is what you
can do when you're

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.630
looking at mobile
devices that you really

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.231
do distort the image,
which is not what we want.

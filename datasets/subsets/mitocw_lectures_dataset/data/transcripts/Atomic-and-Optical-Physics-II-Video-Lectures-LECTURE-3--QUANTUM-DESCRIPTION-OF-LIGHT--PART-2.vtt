00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.610
PROFESSOR: So good afternoon.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.160
Let's have an on-time departure.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.080
Last week, we talked about
quantum states of light.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.960
So we're talking about the
photon, the quantum description

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.590
of the electromagnetic field.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.490
And I introduced for you the
most classical quantum state

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.620
of the electromagnetic field,
namely the coherent state.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.990
I don't want to go through
the formalism again,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.700
but the coherent state
has a simple definition,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.920
simple but subtle.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.170
It's an eigenstate of the
annihilation operator,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.800
and it has a complex
eigenvalue alpha.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.480
And from that, you
can pretty much

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.930
derive everything you want to
know about coherent states.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.779
Colin.

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:12.174
AUDIENCE: What was the
purpose of-- whoever

00:01:12.174 --> 00:01:15.207
discovered eigenstates-- what
was the purpose of trying

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.292
to find the eigenvalues
of destruction?

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:18.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
isn't that subtle?

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.100
Isn't that weird?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
How does somebody want to
find the eigenfunctions

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.050
of an annihilation operator,
because the annihilation

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.790
operator is non-Hermitian?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.510
And why the
annihilation operator?

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.520
Why not the creation operator?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.880
Well, if you try to find the
eigenstates of the creation

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.030
operator, you run into problems.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.070
The eigenstates are
non-normalizable.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.630
It doesn't make any sense.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.140
So here, creation and
annihilation are not symmetric.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.230
You have to pick the
annihilation operator.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.680
Colin, my gut feeling is
that somebody found it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.970
in a different way.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.540
The person who popularized
those states was [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.510
and he got amply
rewarded for that.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.760
And I think you
define coherent state

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.700
as some form of
superposition state.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.640
Maybe people have figured out
if you take a superposition

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.620
state of number states that
this has special properties,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.500
that this is a minimum
uncertainty state, which

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.530
is as close as we can
go in quantum physics

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.540
to obtain a classical
electric field.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.470
So I think maybe people
found it like that.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.040
And then they say, hey, but
there is another operator

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.330
definition eigenstate of
the annihilation operator.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.896
I'm 99 percent certain.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.270
But maybe you can
ask [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.720
when he comes to a CUA seminar
if he discovered coherent state

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.890
as eigenstates of the
annihilation operator.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.234
I don't think so.

00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:40.900
Other questions?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.150
So what I want to do
is-- what the theme

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.510
of the end of last
lecture and today

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.460
is that the coherent
state is a complex number.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.190
The coherent state
has a time evolution.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.150
It moves in a circle.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.000
And this is really the phasor
of the electric field associated

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.620
with it.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.150
So coherent state,
the alpha value

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.160
is directly related
to an electric field.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.240
That's why this state
is closely related

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.820
to the classical limit of
the electromagnetic field.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.070
We discussed some properties
of the coherent state.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.130
We looked at the
fluctuations and showed

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.295
that it's a
Poissonian statistic.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.530
And then we use now--
once you define something,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.360
you can use it as a tool.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.570
We are now using
the coherent states

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.880
to look at any
other quantum state

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.930
of the electromagnetic field,
any statistical operator which

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.830
describes photons by
forming the diagram matrix

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.680
element of the statistical
operator with alpha.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.200
If you just want to sort of
think about it intuitively,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.525
alpha is like the
best description

00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:17.550
of an electromagnetic field.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.110
So if you write
down this, we ask,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.870
What is the probability for
an arbitrary quantum state

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.770
described by an arbitrary
statistical operator-- what

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.180
is the probability that
the electric field is

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.560
alpha in the
complex description?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.650
So that's what those
quasi-probabilities

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.830
are-- Q of alpha.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.460
And we immediately looked
at some examples, of course,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.430
of probabilities.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.290
We showed that the vacuum
state is sort of an area.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.300
It's a Gaussian.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.850
And the area is-- it's an area.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.900
I don't know.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.400
I forgot the [? prefect. ?]
It's on the order of 1 or 1/2.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.775
We realize that
thermal states are also

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:13.890
a Gaussian centered
at the origin.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.000
But it is a much
wider distribution.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.480
So thermal states have
much more uncertainty

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.910
in the electric field
than the vacuum state.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.410
And then we looked at
the coherent state.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.580
And now, of course, when we
looked at the coherent state,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.660
we realize that coherent
states are maybe not

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.520
as wonderful as I tried
to make you believe.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.560
They have some nasty properties.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.540
And that is when you ask,
What is the probability?

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.580
The quasi-probability of the
coherent state would be beta.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.410
Now, if you would
expect a delta function,

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.200
because when you ask, What is
the probability of a momentum

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.277
state to be p naught?

00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:54.860
If you have a momentum
state p naught,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.180
it has a delta
function at p naught.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.230
But here, it's not
a delta function.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.510
It's a Gaussian of the
standard deviation.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.210
I think the standard deviation
here is-- what is it,

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.820
square root 1 over
square root 2?

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.090
Because the Gaussian has
usually 2 times sigma squared.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.150
And since the
denominator is unity--

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.770
so the standard deviation
of 1 over square root 2.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.950
And that showed us that
the coherent states are not

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.540
orthogonal.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.040
You have to be a
little bit careful.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.340
It's not your
standard basis set.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.820
It's an overcomplete basis.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.840
So therefore the
coherent state is not

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.750
a delta function in
the causal probability.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.280
It's a little bit blurred
circle with an area

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.730
on the order of unity.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:53.380
And you have some homework
assignment to look at it.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.610
So in some way, how
you should look at

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.320
it is that if you see some
quasi-probability distribution,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.040
the distance from
the origin-- this

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.820
is the absolute value
of the electric field.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.020
The phase here is
almost 45 degrees.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.605
But if you look at
this uncertainty,

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:13.785
you would also say,
Well, the phase

00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:16.990
is uncertain to
within this angle.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.540
So you can pretty much
read the uncertainty

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.690
in the total electric field,
the uncertainty in the phase.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.150
You can read pretty
much everything

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.420
you want from this diagram.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.800
Now, when we look at
a number state-- Well,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.440
you often know in
quantum mechanics,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.000
number and phase
are complimentary.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.040
If the number of
photons is fixed,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.860
you know nothing
about the phase.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.580
And indeed the quasi-probability
of a number state is a ring.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.530
It has no phase.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.268
It has completely random
phase over the 2 pi circle.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.370
The energy is sharp
of a number state,

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.120
since the energy is e squared.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.150
You may have expected
a delta function

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.730
in the radial coordinate.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.320
But what you get
is also something

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.630
blurred on the order of unity.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.460
And I want to say something
about that in a second.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.190
Finally, we discuss
the time dependence.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.580
And the time dependence
is very easy.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.380
After all, we're dealing
with an harmonic oscillator.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.500
And in an harmonic
oscillator, if you

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.760
have a plane of x and p,
symmetric and anti-symmetric

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.500
combination of a and a
dagger, in this plane

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.289
in an harmonic oscillator,
the quantum state

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.860
is just rotating circle,
a rotation with omega.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.870
And indeed we showed that when
we apply the time evolution

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.990
operator-- and some of
you were right, of course,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.890
with a minus sign-- it moves
with e to the minus i omega t.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:59.780
And therefore everything
rotates in a clockwise way.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:11.540
Now, we discussed the operator
of the electric field.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:17.920
And in this
quasi-probability-- Sorry,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.930
we discussed the operator
of the electric field.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.750
And I hope you remember
that in the analogy

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.670
with the harmonic oscillator,
the electric field was

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.099
a minus a dagger.

00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:29.515
And this is the
momentum operator.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.910
In those quasi-probabilities--
and we will see more about it--

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.530
something which is
sharp in momentum

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.640
is a sliver parallel
to the x-axis.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.320
So therefore, you can
regard the vertical axis,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.630
which is the imaginary part of
alpha, as the momentum axis.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.490
And you can regard this
as-- the horizontal axis--

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.270
as the x-axis.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.500
So therefore, since
momentum is electric field,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.180
you always get
the electric field

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.890
by projecting onto
the vertical axis.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.510
And if you project
this fuzzy ball,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.810
you get a value 0
with some uncertainty.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.960
And if this
quasi-probability starts

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.800
to rotate due to
the time evolution,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.790
we get an oscillating
electromagnetic field, almost

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.890
classical except
for that fuzziness.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.720
So that's where we
want to continue.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.760
Any questions about that?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.559
Yes?

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:43.912
AUDIENCE: Why is there no
phase fuzziness in the E t?

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.940
PROFESSOR: No phase fuzziness.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.820
There is a phrase fuzziness.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.830
For instance, if you would
say the phase is determined

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.650
by the 0 crossing, you don't
know exactly when the 0

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.480
crossing happened,
and that corresponds

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.870
to an uncertainty in the phase.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.220
Trust me, everything
is in this diagram.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.490
Now, there are two things
we want to continue.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:16.700
One is I want to show you
that the coherent state is

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.570
a minimum uncertainty state.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:27.372
The product of delta
x delta p is just--

00:11:27.372 --> 00:11:29.380
is it h-bar or h-bar over two?

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.370
One of the two.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.370
So it's a minimum
uncertainty state.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.500
And therefore, you can
never have a quantum state

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.260
which is less fuzzy
than the coherent state.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.630
So this fuzziness here is
the intrinsic uncertainty

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.110
of quantum physics.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.460
So that's what we
want to discuss today.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.150
But then we will
immediately start

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.000
with non-classical states.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.140
And that is, well, if
this area is determined

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.970
by Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation, what

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.650
can be maybe deform the
circle into an ellipse,

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.910
and these are three
states of light.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.785
So that's an outlook.

00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:07.826
That's what you're going
to do in the second half

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:08.410
of the class.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:23.720
But before I do that, I
want to be a little bit more

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.690
accurate about
quasi-probabilities.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:37.830
And this is almost
like a disclaimer now.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.980
Just to give you
the bigger picture.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.900
What we want to achieve with
those quasi-probabilities,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.300
we want to do what phase space
densities in classical physics.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.150
We have a coordinate which is
x, a coordinate which is p.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.510
And you can often describe
a classical system

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.070
if you know the phase
space distribution,

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.650
if you know the probability
that a particle has

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.280
position x and momentum p.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:20.070
So all this is about
phase space densities.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.902
Probability of x and p.

00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:36.730
Of course, writing it down, you
immediately see the problem.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.490
In quantum mechanics, you cannot
measure x and p simultaneously.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.440
These are non-commuting
variables.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.860
So therefore, what happens is,
if you now define a phase space

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.370
function, which is done in
quantum mechanics textbooks,

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.050
you can actually do it
in three different ways.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:05.300
And the three different
ways are Q, P, and W.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.740
The definition--
I don't want to go

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.190
through the mathematical
subtleties-- the definition

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.210
of those functions involves
the operator definition, a

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.970
and a dagger, or,
which is equivalent,

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.930
the x and p operator.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.120
If you define something in units
of x and p or a and a dagger,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.120
you can have a product
which is fully symmetric i

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.220
in the ordering of x p, which
is anti-normal or normal.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.990
So in other words,
the order matters.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.850
And you have three choices.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:54.080
In an operator product, you can
have symmetric ordering, which

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.310
means not x p, but x p
plus p x, then it's over 2.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.900
That's symmetric.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.660
You can have an ordering
which is called normal

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.315
and one which is
called anti-normal.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:22.695
Ordering of operators in the
operator base definition.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.430
Of course, if you
have three choices,

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.240
you would say, Which
one is the best?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.840
Which one is the winner?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.490
But the fact is all three
have their advantages

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.240
and disadvantages.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.410
So they all have
pluses and minuses.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:06.630
The reason why I picked
for the course Q of alpha

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.900
is that it's a real probability,
it's always positive.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.520
It is a diagonal matrix element
of a statistical operator,

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.160
and this has to be positive.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.260
So it's a real probability.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:30.100
The other guys, P of alpha,
can be positive or negative.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.230
And also, W of alpha can
be positive or negative.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.540
So if you use a P
alpha distribution

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:56.340
statistical operator, it
can be written like this.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:07.680
And as a result, the coherent
state is now not this Gaussian.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.579
It doesn't have this
Gaussian distribution

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.099
as a course of probability.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.180
It's what you want--
what maybe some of you

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.000
wanted to see-- oh, by the
way, it's a delta function.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.680
The probability of the
coherent state alpha

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.520
has a delta function peak at
alpha, which is sort of nice.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.350
And the number state is not
a ring of a finite radius.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.600
I just mentioned to
you the number state.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.800
You would naively expect
the energy is sharp.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.080
The square root of the
energy's electric field,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.970
shouldn't it be sharp?

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.980
And indeed, it is sharp.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.390
It's actually worse
than a delta function.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.125
It's a derivative
of a delta function.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.690
But at least here,
in the probability P,

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.470
which is also called
the Glauber-Sudarshan P

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:05.890
representation, you
get the delta function,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.205
which may be very natural
for certain purposes.

00:18:09.205 --> 00:18:12.189
AUDIENCE: Since the [INAUDIBLE]
and you can express one

00:18:12.189 --> 00:18:15.300
in terms of the
other, is that unique?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.810
PROFESSOR: It is unique by
some symmetry choice here.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:30.240
So that's the advantage
of it, that by-- I'm not

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.460
going into the mathematics.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.410
I'm not giving
you the definition

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.618
but the way how it's defined.

00:18:33.618 --> 00:18:34.180
It's unique.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.760
It can be written in such a way.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.220
And the way how the
quasi-probabilities

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.100
P-- the P representation--
is defined,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.110
you get a delta function
at the coherent state.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.860
And finally, W stands
for Wigner distribution.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:01.570
And the Wigner distribution
is something you actually

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.980
find in most quantum
mechanics textbooks.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.300
The Q and P distribution are
more common in quantum optics.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.490
But the Wigner distribution
has the advantage

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:17.380
that the projection
on the x- and y-axes

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:26.950
are indeed psi of x
squared, psi of p squared.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.760
So you get actually the x
wave function and the p wave

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.580
function.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.950
So now, as a full
disclaimer, if you

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.600
want the electric field, which
is the momentum of the harmonic

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.680
oscillator, which is the
electromagnetic field, what you

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.030
really want to project is the
W function, because for the W

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.250
function, the Wigner
function, the projection

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.060
is exactly the
momentum distribution

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.240
in the electric field.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:06.500
So the Wigner distribution is
closest to the classic phase

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.560
space distribution,
as close as you

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.030
come without
violating commutators.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.600
But of course it
has a disadvantage

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.850
that it has negative values.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.710
And try to explain to
your next neighbor what

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.990
is a negative probability.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:34.500
Some people actually see
negative probabilities spring

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.420
out the non-classical character.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.990
And I know in our
field, in AMO physics,

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.380
a few years ago, in
my lifetime, there

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.010
were really attempts to use
quantum state homography

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.950
and measure for the first time
a negative Wigner distribution

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.530
and show that to the world.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.520
So that meant something
to a lot of people.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:00.300
Anyway, you can read about it
in quantum physics textbooks.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.690
All I want you to know
is to know about it,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.947
but then also just relax.

00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:08.030
In the bigger picture, all
the three distributions

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.340
are the same.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.270
It's more sort of on the
level of whether something

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.660
is a delta function
or has widths unity.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.630
So on the small
scale, it matters.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.450
But if you map out
something on a bigger scale,

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.390
they are all related
to each other.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.830
And for the rest off
today and the next class,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.520
when I show you those phase
space distribution, when

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.240
I say I project onto
the vertical axis

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.190
to get the electric
field, I'm not

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.340
completely rigorous which
of the three functions

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.280
I've really chosen.

00:21:43.687 --> 00:21:44.270
Any questions?

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:57.760
OK.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.070
So I promised you--
and this is what

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.300
we're going to do now is
we're want to understand

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.723
in more depth the fluctuations.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.550
And in particular,
I want to show you

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:24.610
that coherent states are
minimum uncertainty states.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.250
So by identifying the
vertical axis with p,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.230
the horizontal axis with
x, we immediately expect

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.260
that we find a result related
the Heisenberg uncertainty

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.480
principle, which says sit the
widths in P and the widths in Q

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.780
has to be larger
than h-bar over 2.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:10.930
And we are mainly talking with
light about the photon creation

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.210
and annihilation operator.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:21.640
But, just as a reminder, the
momentum and position operator

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.906
are symmetric and
anti-symmetric combinations.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:47.540
So let me just call
those [? prefecters ?]

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.843
Q naught and this one P naught.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:06.230
Well, we can then
immediately, by just

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:11.190
using elementary
commutator, calculate

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:17.276
what are the expectation values
in a coherent state for P,

00:24:17.276 --> 00:24:20.330
P squared, Q, and Q squared.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:38.550
For P, it is-- the P
operator is a dagger minus a.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.270
If we act with a on
alpha, we get alpha,

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.880
because alpha-- the
coherent state--

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.060
is an eigenstate of alpha.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.850
Now, with a dagger we act
on the left hand side.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.460
And we get alpha star.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.330
Well, with P squared
and Q squared,

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.750
you have to use one
or two more steps

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.550
to get rid of the products.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.350
But ultimately, you can
express space all that just

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:17.400
in powers of alpha, alpha
squared, alpha star, and such.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:24.040
So what we want is
we want to find out

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:32.210
what are the fluctuations delta
Q, delta P. Just as a reminder,

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:40.190
delta Q squared is of course Q
squared average minus Q average

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.010
squared.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.772
And Q squared
average and Q squared

00:25:43.772 --> 00:25:45.105
is what we have just calculated.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.370
Actually, let me leave it
in as a reminder for you--

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:03.890
Q squared minus Q average
squared, the square root of it.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:11.990
And what we find is that it's
square root h-bar over 2 omega

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:17.710
and, for delta P, it is square
root h-bar over omega 2.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:23.190
And what we verify, that
indeed, for a coherent state,

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.635
the product of the 2 is
Heisenberg uncertainty limit.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:44.855
So therefore, coherent states
are minimum uncertainty states.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.560
And maybe, Colin, to
address your question,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.590
I could imagine that
coherent states were maybe

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.650
invented by simply saying, We
have an harmonic oscillator

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.200
data.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.480
We want to find the
minimum uncertainty

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.130
states for which the
uncertainty in x and p,

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.660
when expressed in natural
units, is the same.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.740
In other words,
the coherent state

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.780
is the solution to the
following question.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:36.470
If you plot the
quasi-probability distribution,

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.980
you give yourself
an uncertainty area.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:49.060
One horizontal
uncertainty is delta Q.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:55.500
The vertical
uncertainty is delta P.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.570
And the minimum
uncertainty state

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.080
means that the area of the
2 uncertainties, the area

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:18.040
of the shaded region, delta P
times delta Q is h-bar over 2.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:31.094
Or if I want to
rewrite that in-- Yes,

00:28:31.094 --> 00:28:37.210
in the real part of alpha
times the uncertainty

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:41.810
in the imaginary part of alpha
for the quasi-probability,

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.100
then this is 1/4.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.150
OK.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:04.460
So what we have learned
is that-- just one second.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:12.480
We have learned about one way
to characterize uncertainties--

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.660
the quantumness of the
electromagnetic field--

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:22.950
by looking at the uncertainties
in the x and p variable.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.230
And that led us to minimum
uncertainty states.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.830
Now, I want to now
introduce to you

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:35.930
two other ways of characterizing
the uncertainty of quantum

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.300
states of light.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:43.370
One is we can ask, What are
the fluctuations in the photon

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:44.490
number?

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.950
Right now, we have
asked, What are

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.274
the fluctuations in
the electric field?

00:29:48.274 --> 00:29:49.690
But the next
question is, What are

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.400
the fluctuations in
the photon number?

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.490
Or we can ask, what
are fluctuations

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.950
in the intensity when
we measure the intensity

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.732
of the electromagnetic field?

00:30:02.732 --> 00:30:03.440
So let's do that.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:22.265
The fluctuations-- It
seems I've lost my lines.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.730
OK.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:41.950
So the fluctuations
of the intensity

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.380
are usually expressed by the
second order temporal coherence

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.039
function.

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:48.580
That's what we want
to introduce now.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:21.550
Yes, this is the second
order temporal correlation

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.570
or coherence function.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.950
What I'm always
encountering in this course

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.720
is I would just like
to immediately tell you

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.110
how it is defined in terms
of a's and a daggers.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.950
It's simple.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.130
It's quantum mechanical.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.320
It's exact.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:46.190
But I always feel that if
you want to really appreciate

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.560
the quantum character, you have
to know the classic description

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.710
first.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.270
So I want to first tell you what
is the second order coherence

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.540
function for
classical light, which

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.690
has a classic description.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:03.394
And then you'll see
what is the difference

00:32:03.394 --> 00:32:04.560
for quantum states of light.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.040
So the classical
description is you

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.785
measure the intensity of light.

00:32:14.785 --> 00:32:16.020
You're just sitting here.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.870
You receive light
from a light bulb.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.180
You measure the
intensity at time t.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:27.620
You measure the intensity
at time tau later.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.965
And then you form the product.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.730
And you normalize it by the
average intensity squared.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.580
So if tau equals 0,
it's nothing else

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.830
than the intensity
squared average divided

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.910
by the average of the
intensity squared.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:07.360
So this is the classical
definition, g2 of tau.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.770
And I've left the
proof to the homework

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:24.560
to show that the classical g2
of tau is always larger than 1.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.000
But it's pretty much what
you show is for tau equal 0,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.680
it means I squared
average is larger

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.770
than I average squared, which
is, of course, always the case.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:40.230
But you can show that this is
also the case for finite tau.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:48.150
So quantum mechanically, we will
see that the g2 function is not

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.060
necessarily larger than 1,
it can be smaller than 1.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.700
And that's actually
an interesting--

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.070
you can see-- litmus
test for the quantumness.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:02.770
If you generate states of the
electromagnetic field-- Fock

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.560
states, photon number states--
we see that in a moment.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.350
And they have a g2 of tau
which is smaller than 1.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.749
You know it is not
possible in any way

00:34:12.749 --> 00:34:18.900
to associate an intensity
of the electromagnetic field

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.230
with that photon
state, because whenever

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.600
you can associate a
classical intensity with it

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.409
and use a classical intensity
to calculate the second order

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.210
correlation function,
you get something

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.030
which is larger than 1.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.440
So often therefore
again, when people

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.929
want to show we really have now
non-classical photon states,

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:44.020
they show g2 of tau
is smaller than 1.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.469
This is similar to
what I said before when

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:51.040
you want to show that you
have non-classical light,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.780
you do quantum state
homography, measure the Wigner

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.540
distribution, and show that
the Wigner distribution has

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.360
negative quasi-probabilities.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.590
That's again something which
is classically not possible.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:06.407
It's only possible if you have
a truly non-classical state.

00:35:06.407 --> 00:35:08.365
AUDIENCE: So in the
definition of g2 classical,

00:35:08.365 --> 00:35:11.732
the expectation values would
need averaging over time, not

00:35:11.732 --> 00:35:15.797
over ensembles of I of t?

00:35:15.797 --> 00:35:16.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.240
You can average over ensembles.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.660
So you can have 1,000 light
bulbs, switch them all on,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.010
and then measure at
a certain time z.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.190
But what we assume here
is that the light bulb

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.580
is on continuously.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.490
So things don't
really depend on t.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.990
I've implicitly taken care of
it by defining the g2 function

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.520
only of tau and
not of t and tau.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.560
You assume any time is the same,
because it's a distribution,

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.530
it's this ensemble
in steady state.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.920
But it's sort of the same
story again and again.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.650
In classical physics, you can
determine an ensemble average

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.640
by taking an ergotic
system and observing it

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.250
at many, many times.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.410
And then the idea is
that one system as time

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.880
goes by will sample
all possible states.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.350
Or you can prepare many,
many identical systems

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.239
and do more of what is
an ensemble average.

00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:18.780
So in other words,
you would actually

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.740
think, if you switch on a
light bulb with a stable power

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.310
supply, that the light
emitted by the light bulb

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:29.570
will go through all possible
quantum states as time evolves.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.580
And therefore, the
temporal average

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.080
is equal to the
ensemble average.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:01.073
So how do we generalize
that to quantum mechanics?

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:11.610
Well, one possibility
would be that-- OK.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.299
First of all, for
quantum mechanics,

00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:14.340
we have to use operators.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:31.910
And one choice would
be that, well, you

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:37.420
say the intensity of
the electromagnetic wave

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.600
is proportional to the
electric field squared.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.770
And you want to use the operator
for the electric field squared.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.090
Now, there is a little
bit of a problem,

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.340
because what we really
mean quantum mechanically

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.790
by g2 of tau is we
measure the intensity now

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.210
and a little bit later.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.520
But measuring the intensity
really means absorbing photons,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.040
because the only way how you can
measure the intensity of light

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.280
is with a photomultiplier.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.790
It makes click, the
photon is absorbed.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:14.280
And this is not fully described
by the electric field.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.240
Just assume you
have no photon, you

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.600
are in the zero-point state
of your harmonic oscillator,

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.760
and your E squared has
zero-point fluctuations.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:30.640
So what is more closely
related to an experiment how

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.210
you measure the
correlation function is

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:39.640
you want to look
at something else,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:55.180
namely at the probability
of absorbing 2 photons.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.690
So you start with
an initial state.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.750
You annihilate 2 photons.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.570
And then you have a final state.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.220
But if you're only
interested in what

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.080
is the probability you
want to characterize

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:22.140
your initial state, you may want
to sum over all final state.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.890
And this is your
total probability

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.250
that you can absorb 2 photons
out of an initial state.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:33.110
But since you're in sum
now over all final state,

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:40.290
this turns into--
Now, I could put

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:45.970
for you as in the final
state is a complete basis.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.405
But I can also take it out.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.520
So this is what we get.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:02.200
So this suggests
that experiments

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:07.630
where we look at two subsequent
clicks of a photomultiplier

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.960
where we determine the
photon correlation,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:17.090
that this is measuring a
correlation function, which,

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:21.060
for quantum states of
light, should be defined

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:27.000
as the expectation value of
a dagger, a dagger, a, a.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:35.870
And now we have to normalize
by the probability squared

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:43.735
of absorbing 1 photon, which
is a dagger a expectation

00:40:43.735 --> 00:40:44.485
value squared.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.820
I just tried to be a
little bit too motivated.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.620
In many, many textbooks,
the discussion

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.995
would start with
this expression.

00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:57.090
You ask, Where
does it come from?

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.460
And you realize yes,
for some measurement

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.980
with photomultipliers,
that's what you measure.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:11.060
But I wanted to show you how
it is related to the intensity

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.440
correlation function
defined classically.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.246
Cody.

00:41:14.246 --> 00:41:15.662
AUDIENCE: But this
looks like it's

00:41:15.662 --> 00:41:18.750
constant in tau,
which doesn't really

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.410
make sense intuitively to me,
because at least classically,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:25.790
it shouldn't be constant in tau.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.120
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.750
That's the next
thing I wanted to say

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:33.580
is I've swept here-- I
just wanted to give you

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.720
the structure of the
operators and not

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.250
get distracted by
discussing time.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.510
I've dropped the
time argument here.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:52.550
But the fact is that as
long as we limit ourselves

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.070
to a single mode of the
electromagnetic field,

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.910
a single harmonic oscillator,
things are independent of tau.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:05.110
In other words, g2 of
tau equals g2 of 0,

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:07.790
as long as we're dealing
with single mode light.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.480
You can actually say--
and that sort of tells you

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.750
where the fluctuations
come-- if g2 of tau changes,

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.530
it comes because you
have several modes

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.990
of the electromagnetic field,
which, as a function of time,

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.820
constructively and
destructively interfere.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.790
But if you have a single
mode, in a single mode--

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:29.590
and what is a single mode?

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.190
It's just a sine wave.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.330
And nothing happens
as a function of time.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.200
It's constant.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.334
AUDIENCE: So both
modes go inside.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.030
PROFESSOR: I'm squeezing a
textbook of quantum optics

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.550
into two classes.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.170
And I want to give you the
ideas and the concepts.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.550
What I've sort of mixed
up here deliberately

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.830
is I've given you the classic
definition of the intensity

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:04.150
correlation function, which is
the famous Hanbury Brown Twiss

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.640
experiment, and
used correlations

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.530
as a function of time.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.580
Then I've motivated
how this should

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.520
be defined for quantum
states of light.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.730
But when I transitioned to
quantum states of light,

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:21.290
I decided to deal with
only one mode of the light.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.840
We should now sum
over-- I should

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.600
put double or triple
indices on all the alphas

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.090
for polarization,
for spatial modes,

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.600
for different frequencies,
and we sum over all of them.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.470
But instead what I did is
I wanted to just show you

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.704
the simple case-- and I
think you will be thankful

00:43:41.704 --> 00:43:43.370
for that in your
homework, that you only

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.010
have to deal with
the simple case--

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.410
that you only have to
look at a's and a daggers

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:50.400
in the operator algebra
for single mode,

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.700
for single harmonic oscillator.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.680
But what we lose,
so to speak here,

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.530
is there is nothing
interesting going on in time.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:01.170
I've already told you that,
for a single mode, all

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.630
of these quasi-probabilities,
they just rotate in a circle.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.160
So the time evolution
of the system

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.730
you're describing right
now is completely boring.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.340
It's really a rotation.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.577
And if you would rotate
your head at omega,

00:44:13.577 --> 00:44:14.410
nothing will happen.

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.840
And this is exactly
what you see here.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:22.200
So you find everything you
want to for coherence time.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.010
Coherence time is the time for
2 modes to get out of phase.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.560
But if you have 1 mode,
there is no coherence time.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.420
And when you find,
for classical light,

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.880
that the g2 function has a peak
which decays with the time,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.030
it is the time for modes
to get out of phase.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.690
But in a single mode
picture, this is absent.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:48.600
Anyway, what is important now
for the discussion of quantum

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.460
character of light
is really, we find

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.820
that in a single mode picture.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.400
So I want to show you
now-- or at least give you

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.910
the summary of
the results, which

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.240
can be very easily derived,
because the math is very

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.860
simple of those
operators, that we are now

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.260
with that definition.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.340
We have g2 functions, which
are no longer following

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.490
the classic constraint that
g2 has to be larger than 1.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.370
We find g2 functions
which are smaller than 1.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.110
And this sort of
tells us now where

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:21.890
do we find the most
non-classical behavior,

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.750
namely when g2 of tau
is as small as possible.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.810
OK.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:39.420
In your homework, you
will show immediately

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:46.935
that the g2 function is
related to number fluctuations.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.745
It's related to an average
and an n-squared average.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.810
Let me just write that down.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:06.290
It's independent of tau.

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:11.180
And the reason is we have
now limited ourselves

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.460
to just one mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:46:27.771 --> 00:46:28.757
Fano factor.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.305
Just give me one--

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:45.660
OK So we are back
to-- We started

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.670
with intensity fluctuations.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.170
But for a single mode of
the electromagnetic field,

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.110
we are back to photon numbers.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:56.400
So what we are now expressing
with the g2 function

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.805
are, in other words, just
fluctuations of photon numbers.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.760
I want to in a minute
draw you a table.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.070
What are the fluctuations
in the photon number

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.610
for the states we have
encountered-- the number

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.430
state, the Fock state,
the coherent state,

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.080
and the thermal state?

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:25.710
And we want to characterize
those quantum states of light

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.490
by the g2 function.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:31.660
And actually, I can drop to
time argument or set it to 0.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.460
But then we first
make a reference

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:43.460
that g2 can now
be smaller than 1.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:48.600
So g2 for a single mode light
is nothing else than a function.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.700
When you know what is an
average and n squared average,

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.300
you know your g2 function.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.950
There is another
quantity, which we often

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:02.700
use to characterize the
fluctuations in the photon

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.230
number.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:06.400
And this is called
the Fano factor.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:13.940
The Fano factor is-- wants
to compare the fluctuations.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:19.712
n square average minus
n average squared,

00:48:19.712 --> 00:48:20.836
these are the fluctuations.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.850
The classical
fluctuation-- well,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.750
I say classical, classical
in the simplest case--

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.533
are Poissonian fluctuations.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.880
So maybe we want to
normalize the fluctuations

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.100
by Poissonian fluctuation.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:48.610
So for Poissonian statistics,
what I just wrote down

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:49.450
would be 1.

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:04.870
And well, if you
now subtract 1, we

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.680
have the situation that
the final factor, which

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.470
is positive, is
super-Poissonian--

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.430
more fluctuation
than Poissonian--

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:15.150
and the negative final
factor is sub-Poissonian.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:24.670
So with those
definitions, we can now

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:35.810
compare the different states
of light we have introduced.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:44.770
We started out with black-body
radiation, thermal radiation.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:49.320
We defined coherent states.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.150
And the harmonic oscillator
description naturally

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:55.560
gave us harmonic
oscillator eigenstates,

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.540
the number of states,
or Fock states.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.050
So there are three ways
to characterize it.

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:07.790
They are all useful.

00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:10.550
One is we can look at n squared.

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:13.250
We can calculate
the Fano factor.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.730
Or we can calculate g2 of 0.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:26.030
For the coherent
state-- remember,

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.600
the coherent state
is as close as we

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.180
can come quantum
mechanically to the ideal

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.090
of a pure electromagnetic wave.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:37.930
It has a Fano factor of 0.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:42.280
This means it's Poissonian.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.970
The g2 function
is simply 1, which

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:51.230
is the lowest classical limit.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.340
So those two tell you that a
coherent state is sometimes

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.880
what you think-- what
comes out of a laser is

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.060
an ideal electromagnetic
wave, which

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.160
has no temporal fluctuations
in the intensity.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.660
Therefore, g2 is 1.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:10.930
And the photon number is
Poissonian distributed.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:16.440
And that means that n
squared is an average times 1

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.060
plus an average.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.720
We actually
discussed it earlier.

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:25.890
The thermal state
is quite different.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.330
If you use-- kind
of pluck together

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.715
the results we have obtained,
it has a Fano factor of n-bar.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.560
So this is super-Poissonian.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:45.440
If the occupation
number n is large,

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.460
you have fluctuations
which are much,

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.500
much larger than
Poissonian fluctuation.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.630
The g2 function is 2.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.040
It's sometimes
called thermal light.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.500
Chaotic light has
a g2 function of 2.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.790
Laser light or coherent state
has a g2 function of one.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:10.010
And n square average is
n-bar 1 plus 2 n-bar.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:14.550
OK.

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.780
But now finally, maybe
the most interesting state

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.620
from the perspective of
non-classical light--

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.110
of quantum light-- is
the photon number state.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:28.890
Well, for the photon number
state, the number of photons

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:31.520
is an eigenvalue.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:37.980
Therefore, n squared average
is n average squared.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.050
The Fano factor is minus 1.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.910
Sub-Poissonian distribution.

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:50.990
And the g2 function, which
classically cannot go below 1,

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:55.280
is now n minus 1 over n.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.600
It is smaller than 1.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:03.650
And you see immediately that
the biggest violation for g2

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:13.780
is to go to minus 1 for the
case of a single photon state.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.388
Any questions?

00:53:22.388 --> 00:53:24.868
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't it
be 0 for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.240
PROFESSOR: The g2 function?

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.230
No, if you put in-- wait.

00:53:46.226 --> 00:53:46.725
Yes.

00:53:49.545 --> 00:53:50.045
Gosh.

00:54:02.931 --> 00:54:03.680
I'll double-check.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.763
I'm a little bit confused.

00:54:04.763 --> 00:54:17.197
But I-- At least
it's consistent now.

00:54:17.197 --> 00:54:19.196
I'm not sure if it's
right, but it's consistent.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:25.120
By the way, if
there is a question,

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.390
I sometimes make a
question mark in my notes.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:32.605
And when I post the
notes-- maybe not when

00:54:32.605 --> 00:54:33.980
I post the notes
on the next day,

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.900
but a few days later-- the
question marks are eliminated.

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:43.540
Just as an example,
last class, there

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:48.080
was some relation
for which I didn't

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.860
remember how the
derivation was done.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.710
When I post those notes
today, the derivation

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.720
is now in the notes.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.310
I'm not announcing
it separately.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.910
But whenever I have a
question mark in class

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.660
and I don't think it's
worth an extra announcement,

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.775
it is fixed in the
posted notes and you

00:55:04.775 --> 00:55:05.900
find the information there.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.920
OK.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.230
So this is now drawing our
attention to the single photon.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.050
And this is our next subsection.

00:55:26.529 --> 00:55:27.820
This shouldn't come unexpected.

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:40.200
If you want to emphasize the
difference between quantum

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.950
light and classic light,
where does it come from?

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.600
Well, it comes from the
quantization of light.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.640
It comes from the
photon character.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.480
It comes from the
effect that light is not

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.390
a continuous stream of energy,
it comes quantized in photons.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:00.240
So the granularity of light
due to the photon character

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.044
is, of course, most pronounced
for a single photon.

00:56:05.044 --> 00:56:08.150
For instance, when we
define the g2 function

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.750
as a correlation of
detecting a photon

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.110
and detecting
another photon, well,

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:16.110
if you've only one photon,
you find one photon,

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.460
and for the next photon, there
is no photon to be detected.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.220
So the probability of
detecting two photons is 0.

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.410
And that only happens when you
go down to similar photons.

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:31.210
So this is when
certain fluctuations

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:37.470
are most pronounced,
because the energy is

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.860
dependant on a singular photon.

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:43.216
Let me first address
one misconception.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:53.260
You can say, Well, let's
just use a coherent state.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:57.980
And we talk about
the attenuator--

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.040
the quantum attenuator
with all its operator

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.090
beauty-- probably not today
but it the next lecture.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.752
But let me already sort
of prepare you for that.

00:57:08.752 --> 00:57:11.210
When you have a coherent state,
when you have a laser beam,

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:12.790
you can put an attenuator.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.110
And your laser beam gets
weaker and weaker and weaker.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:17.840
But it stays a coherent state.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.490
And I will prove that
to you very soon.

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:24.370
So you can now say that you
take your coherent state

00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:28.205
and you attenuate it down that
there is only one photon left.

00:57:28.205 --> 00:57:31.950
Is that a single photon state?

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.480
The answer is no.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.990
It is an attenuated
coherent state.

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.760
Coherent states, as I've just
shown you, are very classical.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.930
They've always
Poissonian distribution.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.980
They've always a
g2 function of 1.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.420
And attenuation is
not changing it.

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.030
Attenuation is preserving that.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:52.730
So now I want to
show you explicitly

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:58.100
why an attenuated coherent
state may have an average photon

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:03.010
number of 1 but it shares
nothing else with a quantum

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:06.270
state of 1 photon of
n equals 1 Fock state.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:16.770
So a coherent state with an
expectation value of 1 photon

00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:19.770
is not a single photon.

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:33.640
And this can be, for
instance, expressed

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.590
by looking what is
actually the probability,

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:39.910
if you have such
a coherent state,

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:44.270
to find 1, 2, or 3 photons.

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:52.440
Well, the probability to find
0 photons-- no photon at all--

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.550
is actually 1/3.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:59:00.740
So the probability to find 1
photon or to find 0 photons

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:03.040
is the same.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.880
The probability to
find 2 photons is 0.18.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.360
So here you have a probability
of finding a photon

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.490
and correlating it with
the next photon click.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:15.390
And you have even,
on first sight,

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:25.690
a surprisingly large probability
to find 3 and 4 photons.

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:30.810
So in 2 percent of the cases,
you will find 4 photons.

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:43.930
Whereas in contrast, the Fock
state with quantum number n

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:54.350
equals 1 is an eigenstate
of the number operator

00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:58.440
beta with eigenvalue n equals 1.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:08.580
So that tells you, if you
want to get n equals 1,

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.000
if you want to get a
single photon state,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.060
you cannot just use a strong
laser beam or a strong light

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.840
source and attenuate it.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.920
You have to work with something
which genuinely creates only 1

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:30.090
photon without any ambiguity,
without any fluctuations,

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:34.840
without any possibility
of creating 2 photons.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.920
And I would actually say
over the last 10 or 15 years,

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.750
the creation of
single photons has

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.790
been sort of a small
cottage industry,

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:50.600
because single photons are often
needed for protocols in quantum

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.530
computation-- for experiments
which really require accurate

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.800
quantum state
preparation of light--

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.050
and in particular,
non-classical light.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:09.970
But of course, there are ways
how you can get single photons.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:13.540
And this is, well, you
start with single atoms.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:17.910
If you have a single atom
in the excited state,

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:19.590
it can emit only one photon.

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:44.450
So in other words,
you cannot-- Usually,

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.410
we don't have the tools to
prepare a single photon--

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:50.530
to take a single photon
out of many, many photons--

01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:52.570
and store it separately.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:56.530
But what we can control
is single atoms.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:58.620
We can prepare single atoms.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.450
And then we can make
sure that single atoms

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:02.900
create single photons.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.870
It's a little bit a way that
we cannot control the bullets

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.820
which are fired.

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.380
But we can control the guns.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:13.190
And we make sure that each gun
can emit exactly one bullet.

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:14.910
So that's a way
how we can create

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:16.916
non-classical states of light.

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:24.690
Yes.

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:33.738
So let's now look for
those single photons

01:02:33.738 --> 01:02:36.015
at the quasi-probability
distribution.

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:45.580
So we obtain the
quasi-probability distribution

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:50.880
by taking the
single photon state

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.040
and projecting it
on a coherent state.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.790
You remember-- it's higher
up in the notes-- what

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:03.540
the coherent state alpha
is in the Fock state basis,

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.750
in a number basis.

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.660
And so we're just
picking out n equals 1.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.365
And this was nothing
else than alpha

01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:15.790
squared times e to the
minus alpha squared.

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:21.080
So therefore, in these
diagrams with the real part

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:28.650
and imaginary part, if I
plot the quasi-probability

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:35.700
distribution, we get a ring.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.650
The ring immediately tells us
that there is no phase defined.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.830
All the phases are
equally probable.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.800
And that also
means, if you don't

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.550
have a phase, the average value
of the electric field this 0.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:27.020
Since the equation
of single photons

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.630
is essential for studying
non-classical light,

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:35.760
but also since it's a very
active frontier of our field--

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.630
actually, one of the
leaders in this field

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.320
is Professor Vladan
Vuletic here at MIT--

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.160
let me at least give
you a taste of how

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.990
to create single photons.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:54.500
I already gave you
the major ingredient.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:59.270
Namely, it's about-- it
involves single atoms.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:03.200
But it's a little bit
more demanding like that.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.630
So you want to take
1 atom home or 1 ion.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:11.310
But the problem is if the
atom or ion emits a light,

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:14.690
it can emit the light
into all directions.

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:18.310
And therefore, you have a
single photon afterwards.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:22.350
But you have many, many
different spacial modes.

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:26.730
And in any given mode, it
will not have a single photon.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:33.420
So therefore, what you have
to add to the single atom

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.790
or single ion is-- you
have to put it in a cavity.

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:54.000
And then, in the limit of a
very, very high finesse cavity,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.560
the probability will
be very, very high

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.990
that your photon is emitted
into the mode of the cavity

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.030
and it is not emitted
perpendicular into other modes.

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.380
But that itself is
not yet sufficient,

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.560
because you have
a single photon,

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.520
but you also want to know when
does the single photon arrive.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.070
You want to do experiments.

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.870
You want single
photons on demand.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:34.140
And so one option is that
you prepare your atoms

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.970
in the ground state.

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:43.630
You take a pi pulse, which,
with 100 percent probability,

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:46.700
excites the atom to
the excited state.

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:53.790
And then within an
actual lifetime,

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:57.330
or maybe even in
resonator-enhanced inverse

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:02.000
natural line widths, the
single photon is emitted.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.790
So therefore, you
pump the system

01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:07.730
and then you know within
the next few nanoseconds

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:10.720
your cavity mode will
have a single photon.

01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:37.010
The problem here is
that you're dealing--

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:43.250
You have to prepare single
atoms, which is difficult.

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:46.290
You have to couple them
to a high finesse cavity.

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:50.410
There is technically
another approach,

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.235
where you use many atoms.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.610
So you could say
that many atoms,

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.380
you no longer have a single gun.

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:59.720
So therefore, you can
get several photons.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:05.310
But the singleness in photons
comes because the photons

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:08.390
are now heralded--
they are announced.

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.890
And the idea is the following.

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:16.240
If you start with the state 1,
and you have an excited state,

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.344
and you have a pump pulse.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:24.000
Now, if you have many atoms, you
have a much higher efficiency

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.930
of pumping atoms comes
to the excited state,

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:29.490
because if you have n atoms,
it's n times more efficient.

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:32.720
But now you take the
following situation.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.899
You wait until there
is a Raman transition--

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:48.100
until you detect the photon
for Raman transition,

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:53.939
where the excited state
decays to the state 2.

01:08:53.939 --> 01:09:00.810
At this moment, you know I
have now 1 atom in state 2.

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:05.470
So in other words,
you're not starting

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:08.840
with single atoms, which is
sometimes more demanding.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.840
How can you prepare the system?

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.340
It has other disadvantages
that n atoms have.

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:20.569
I'm not sure if I should
mention it, but with n atoms,

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:23.740
they have a super-radiant
factor n with n atoms.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:27.099
You can get an n-times
enhancement of emission

01:09:27.099 --> 01:09:27.890
into a single mode.

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.170
So there are real,
massive advantages

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:32.220
in working with many atoms.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.220
But now you know that
one atom is in state 2

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.990
when you detect
the first photon.

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:44.790
And then you have the same
situation which we had above.

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:50.210
You can now take your
system-- let me just

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.990
redraw the level diagram.

01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:56.230
Excited state, state 1, state 2.

01:09:56.230 --> 01:10:01.810
You know now that you
have 1 single atom here.

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:05.800
And by using a laser
pulse, you can excite it

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.740
to the excited state.

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:16.070
And then you observe
the single photon 2.

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:24.250
So in other words,
the observation

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:31.770
off the first photon
tells you that your system

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:35.120
is prepared with
1 atom in state 2.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.970
And then you can get
a single photon out

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:41.530
of it, which is the photon
for the inverse Raman

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:45.249
transition when you pump
the system back to state 1.

01:10:45.249 --> 01:10:46.665
AUDIENCE: Doesn't
this rely on you

01:10:46.665 --> 01:10:52.848
being able to reliably prepare
a single atom in another quantum

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:55.318
state?

01:10:55.318 --> 01:10:57.294
Won't there always
be some uncertainty

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:59.764
as to how many atoms you
can prepare in one sitting?

01:11:06.674 --> 01:11:08.340
PROFESSOR: There are
some uncertainties.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.850
And what you're
saying is correct.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.070
We don't have perfect
single photon sources.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.520
And people characterize the
fidelity of the single photon

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.150
source.

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:26.750
For instance, if you detect the
single photon, you would say,

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:30.460
Now my system is ready to
emit a single photon triggered

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.752
by this pump pulse.

01:11:31.752 --> 01:11:33.335
And if you can get
now a single photon

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:37.821
in 90 percent of the cases,
you publish a wonderful paper,

01:11:37.821 --> 01:11:39.820
because you've set a new
record for the fidelity

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.490
of a single photon source.

01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:43.820
So people are really
struggling with some

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.460
of those uncertainties.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.770
But to involve, for
instance, three levels

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:52.690
is sort of an advantage,
because you're not

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:56.290
limited by the preparation of
a single atom, for instance.

01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:57.540
You can have many atoms.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.260
The atoms are always there.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.810
And the moment one atom
is prepared in state 2,

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:06.360
this atom announces itself
with a single photon.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.360
So it takes a lot of uncertainty
out that the system says,

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.420
with the first
photon, I'm ready now.

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.120
I can emit a single photon.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.270
And then you get
your single photon.

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:19.930
Then you can gate
your whole experiment

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:23.680
to a time following the
detection of the first photon.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.594
And for your gated
time afterwards, you

01:12:26.594 --> 01:12:28.010
have a very, very
high probability

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.140
of finding this photon.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.590
Or if you want, you can now
do experiments with 2 photons.

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:38.720
If you keep this laser on and
pump the atom immediately back,

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.990
you have actually a
single photon here,

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:42.550
followed by a
single photon here.

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:44.370
It's sort of click clack.

01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:46.790
And now you can do
correlations between two

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:49.720
different single
photon states and such.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.021
It's a very rich
frontier of our field.

01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:53.104
You have another question?

01:12:53.104 --> 01:12:54.078
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:57.487
Is this also within a cavity
now, like the single photon

01:12:57.487 --> 01:12:58.950
[? reflection ?]
in the first test?

01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:59.685
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:12:59.685 --> 01:13:04.290
Actually, these photons--
the wavy lines--

01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.290
are emitted spontaneously.

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:09.800
Spontaneous emission,
pretty much by definition,

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.170
goes into all possible
spatial modes.

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:15.245
And the only way to control the
spatial mode is with a cavity.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.690
What I don't want
to go into details--

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:23.170
but those who have an
understanding of that--

01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:24.250
is the following.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:31.060
If you n atoms and you prepare
one atom here in state 2,

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:34.990
you do not know which of
your n atoms is prepared.

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:40.250
So you have n indistinguishable
possibilities.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.740
And if you have n
indistinguishable probabilities

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.840
which atom you have prepared,
the emission of the photon

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.490
back is n times enhanced.

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:53.030
So therefore, you
have actually a system

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:57.690
which has an n times stronger
coupling to the cavity.

01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:02.820
So having n atoms makes
it much, much easier

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.900
to construct a high
finesse cavity.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.850
You get this super
radiance increase

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:11.270
of the strong coupling for free.

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:16.280
And this is why there are
many reasons why you do not

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.250
want to work with the
single ion or a single atom.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.160
It's possible.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.940
For very fundamental
experiments,

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.920
people have shown
that it can be done.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.550
But technologically,
it's much easier and much

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.030
more robust to work
with many atoms.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.370
But then you need
the many atoms have

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:38.034
to tell you when 1 atom
is prepared to emit now

01:14:38.034 --> 01:14:38.700
a single photon.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.510
If you're interested
in this subject,

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:50.060
talk to the students
in [INAUDIBLE] school.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.467
They're really the
world experts in that.

01:15:06.861 --> 01:15:07.360
OK.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.510
Finally, we're not really
getting to squeeze light.

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.840
We start with squeezing
the light tomorrow.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.620
The last thing in
this major section

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:33.860
is the famous Hanbury
Brown Twiss experiment.

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:43.390
This was a landmark
experiment done in the 1950s.

01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:47.520
And it was the first
experiment which

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.640
really looked at g2 functions
correlations, which one could

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.490
say was the beginning
of quantum optics

01:15:55.490 --> 01:16:00.820
and modern experiments
with light.

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.630
Probably until then, light was
just an electromagnetic wave

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:05.190
people regarded as boring.

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:07.890
But by measuring
now correlations,

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:12.080
people realize that it's an
interesting object to study.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.990
I want to just go
over the basic scheme.

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:21.600
You will look at it
a little bit more

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.370
closely in your
homework assignment.

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.720
So the idea behind an Hanbury
Brown Twiss experiment

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.870
is that you have a
light source and you

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:35.230
want to characterize it.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.635
So the light source emits light.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.790
And now, this is important.

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:57.390
Whenever you want
to detect 2 photons,

01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:59.710
you want to figure out
it's 1 photon followed

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:02.550
by another photon.

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:05.280
Technically, you cannot do
it with a photomultiplier,

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.610
because when a photomultiplier
clicks, it needs many,

01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:12.460
many nanoseconds for the
photomultiplier to read out

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:16.070
the signal and recover to
recharge up its electrodes

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.400
and be ready to detect
the next photon.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.560
So therefore, when you
want to find click click--

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.650
double clicks in the
stream of light--

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:27.170
you have to involve
a beam splitter

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:28.610
and involve two photodetectors.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.150
Sure, you now need an
adequate description.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.250
But in principle,
you can now find

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:39.980
2 photons which are only
a few picoseconds apart,

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:47.220
because the first photon is
observed by the first detector,

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220
and the second
photon is detected

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.209
by the second detector.

01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:53.500
Sure, you would say, What
happens if you're in the beam

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.760
splitter, both photons
go to detector one?

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.200
Well, that's tough luck.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.820
You take 1 chance in
2 that the 2 photons

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.570
go to the 2 different detectors.

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:06.730
But the beam splitter has to
be part of your experiment,

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:08.800
has to become part
of your description.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.860
And this is what you do
in homework number one.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:20.400
So what we are asking here when
we measure the g2 function.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.540
Let's assume that tau equals 0.

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:29.730
We are reading out a signal.

01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:32.835
And what we are using is
a coincidence detector.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.110
We are looking that in a
very small temporal window,

01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:43.330
2 photons are detected
simultaneously.

01:18:43.330 --> 01:18:45.360
Well, this is the
quantum version.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.190
The classical version
is the g2 function

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:51.400
is the product of the
intensity at time t times

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.880
the product of the intensity
at time t plus tau.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.780
So what you would do
here in this circuit,

01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.280
you would take the signal
from this detector, the signal

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.450
from that, and multiply the two.

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:06.480
This is how you determine I
of t times I of t plus tau.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.490
So whether you do it
in the classical domain

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:19.820
or whether you do it
in the quantum domain,

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:23.050
this is the way how
you experimentally

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:28.930
measure the second order
correlation function.

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:41.100
In the classic limit, you
don't have to worry about it.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.450
The classical limit is always
a limit of high intensity.

01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:48.020
So at any given time, you
have a ton of photons.

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.245
And then, at beam splitter,
half of the photons go left,

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:52.640
half of the photons go right.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.370
You have an equal splitting.

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:56.540
You have exactly
half the intensity

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.750
in the left arm and the right
arm after the beam splitter.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:04.150
So there is no problem at
all with the quantization,

01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:06.640
because this is the
classical limit.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.340
So classically you
can say-- actually,

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:13.390
I shouldn't say photon, I
should actually say intensity.

01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:16.240
The intensity splits equally.

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:28.100
And if you do the measurement
with the coincidence detector,

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.180
you find the difference
between the g2 function,

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.010
which I discussed earlier.

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:38.540
That the g2 function is 1 for
coherent light or laser light,

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.475
and the g2 function is
2 for thermal light.

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:50.110
That's actually the only
way how you can distinguish

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.900
a light bulb from a laser beam.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:55.930
If you put a light bulb into
a cavity or couple the light

01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:58.320
from a light bulb into
a fiber, the light

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.120
becomes spatially a single mode.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120
If you put a very
narrow spectral filter

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.410
or Fabry-Perot cavity,
the light becomes

01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:09.000
single mode in frequency domain.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.450
So when you take a light bulb
and spatially and spectrally

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:17.140
filter it that it is single
mode, in terms of the mode,

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:20.630
it is single mode as
a single mode laser.

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:22.305
But it is the
correlation experimental

01:21:22.305 --> 01:21:25.900
which shows you that you
started with a thermal source.

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:29.470
It has a g2 function of 2, and
you can never get rid of it,

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:31.690
whereas the laser beam
has a g2 function of 1.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:34.850
OK.

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:37.220
So this is the
classical version.

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.970
In the quantum version,
especially when

01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:48.300
we have a single
photon, the photon

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.660
can go to only one detector.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.800
And that means, for this
extreme case of a single photon,

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.380
the g2 function is 0.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:07.810
Anyway, you will look at
those situations in more

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:11.670
detail in you
homework assignment.

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:12.374
Yes?

01:22:12.374 --> 01:22:14.082
AUDIENCE: Sir, if you
know that different

01:22:14.082 --> 01:22:17.040
for tau non-zero, then even
the single mode in the function

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.387
would have a final g2
[INAUDIBLE], because there

01:22:20.387 --> 01:22:21.970
would be some
probability [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.300
PROFESSOR: We have to be
now a little bit careful.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:52.930
If you have a single mode Fock
state, there's only 1 photon.

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:56.655
And once this photon is
detected, we have vacuum,

01:22:56.655 --> 01:22:59.340
we have no photon left.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:06.450
So what may be confusing
here is, on first sight,

01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:09.770
is that the way how the
experiment is done and has been

01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:13.880
historically done, it's
not done we Fock states.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.780
It's done with the light
source in a continuous stream

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.220
of photons.

01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.820
So Hanbury Brown
Twiss experiment,

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:24.030
he looked at in
light bulb, or he

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.900
looked at star light and such,
and determined the intensity

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:27.760
correlation.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.800
He couldn't do the
experiment with lasers,

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.660
but now we would
with a laser beam.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.000
And we find that g2 is 1.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.200
But in those
situations, we actually

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.646
do not have the way-- we
have actually a beam, which

01:23:42.646 --> 01:23:45.180
is a stream of photons.

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.190
And this requires a little
bit different description.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:52.210
In other words, when I
have a coherent state,

01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:55.790
a laser beam is
always replenishing

01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:56.740
the coherent state.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.570
The laser beam preserves
the electric field,

01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:03.220
whereas, strictly speaking,
the way how I described it

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:06.370
for pedagogical reasons is
you have a cavity, which

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:09.520
is filled with a
coherent state alpha.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.010
And then you start
analyzing that.

01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:16.080
But in other words,
what we have focused

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.890
in the simple description
is that we have a quantum

01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:21.630
state which is prepared--
it's a closed system.

01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:24.090
And now we do our detection.

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:26.940
The experiment how
it is done is often

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.920
done as in an open system,
where you couple the system

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.580
to a light source,
which is always

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:36.080
replenishing your experiment.

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.250
So to be careful, especially
with a single photon.

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.490
I think, in essence,
the experiment

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:44.090
would be done with a
single photon light source.

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:45.890
But the single
photon light source

01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:48.370
has a high repetition rate.

01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:50.880
I showed you how to
generate single photons.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.430
You have an heralded
single photon.

01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:55.710
You know the single
photon comes now.

01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:57.110
You do the experiment.

01:24:57.110 --> 01:25:00.160
And then you repeat it again.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.730
And then what you
have is you only

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:05.580
look at one single
photon bunch at a time.

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:09.040
And then you find indeed, that
during that temporal window,

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.210
you will never find
a second photon.

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:13.650
So this may happen
in a few nanoseconds.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:18.100
Then you wait a microsecond,
and the next photon arrives.

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.930
Of course, if you would now
describe your light source,

01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:26.980
what you is the g2 of tau,
and tau is a microsecond,

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:30.360
and the microsecond is the time
between the first single photon

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.000
burst and the next
single photon burst,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.380
now you will find that
your g2 function is not 0.

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:39.230
But this is then related
to the repetition

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:42.560
rate of a single photon and not
to the single photon itself.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.810
I think you've got the taste.

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:46.460
Your homework is
a really simple.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.250
You just deal with
a closed system.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.260
You look at a quantum
state at a time.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.570
But if you map it onto
a beam experiment,

01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:55.110
you have to think
about what does it

01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:58.790
mean to have a replenishment
of the quantum state.

01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:59.790
Any question?

01:25:59.790 --> 01:26:03.620
I know I have to stop, but.

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.100
AUDIENCE: In the beam
splitter, the other port

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:10.068
of the beam splitter should
do some stuff, right?

01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.630
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:17.900
Actually, this will keep us busy
for a while, that even if you

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.990
do not put in any light,
we put in the vacuum state.

01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:25.220
And you will find that the
description of the beam

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.020
splitter in the quantum
state is incomplete,

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:32.750
unless you specify that your
beam splitter is coupling

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:36.490
in from a different
mode the vacuum state.

01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:39.190
Yes, this will be
very important.

01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:41.991
And we will cover it
in its full glory.

01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:43.615
AUDIENCE: I just have
a quick question.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:46.750
The way we can distinguish
from a thermal state

01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:49.100
and a coherent state
is through the g2.

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.600
So from an experimental
perspective,

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.050
could we do most of
experiments if we just

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:57.350
had thermal sources that were
very single mode, so to speak?

01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:59.570
PROFESSOR: Well, yes.

01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:03.150
All the laser cooling, all the
[INAUDIBLE], all the absorption

01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:06.990
imaging-- all that would
work if you had a single mode

01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.390
thermal source.

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:11.440
Let's face it, we say we
use lasers for everything

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.040
we're doing.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.930
But the only property
which distinguishes

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:17.130
a laser from the thermal
light source-- we're

01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:19.640
not taking advantage of it.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.950
Of course practically, if
you take a thermal source

01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:24.950
and filter it down
to a single mode,

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.520
you will be left with
only a few photons.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.720
You cannot create an intense
enough single mode light source

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.160
unless you use stimulated
emission into a single mode.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.431
And that's a laser.

01:27:36.431 --> 01:27:36.930
Colin.

01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:41.385
AUDIENCE: The correlation
function for, for example,

01:27:41.385 --> 01:27:44.924
an LED light-- that's not
really a thermal source.

01:27:44.924 --> 01:27:47.215
It's not described by a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

01:27:47.215 --> 01:27:50.680
And that would be closer
to something for a laser,

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.165
even though there is no cavity?

01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:58.420
PROFESSOR: Well, LEDs in some
limit are quantum objects.

01:28:05.732 --> 01:28:07.940
Actually, do you know what
the g2 function of LED is?

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.500
Does it become
laser-like, or does it

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.430
become even antibunched?

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:15.970
Because if it's a relaxation
mechanism-- So anyway,

01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:21.320
what Colin says is
there are actually

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.210
more different light
sources that just the laser

01:28:24.210 --> 01:28:26.650
and the thermal light source.

01:28:26.650 --> 01:28:32.080
There are LEDs or semiconductor
devices, which provide photons

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.010
with interesting
statistical properties.

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:38.731
I've heard about it-- that
LED light sources have

01:28:38.731 --> 01:28:40.230
some special
properties, but I don't

01:28:40.230 --> 01:28:42.020
remember which was the one.

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:42.520
OK.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.380
We have to stop.

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.360
I'll see you on Wednesday.

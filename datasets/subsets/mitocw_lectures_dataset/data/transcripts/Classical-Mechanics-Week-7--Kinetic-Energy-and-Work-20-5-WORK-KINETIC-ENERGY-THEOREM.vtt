00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.580
We are now going to derive
the work-energy principle.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.880
We're going to do so by
using Newton's second law,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.180
but we're not going to consider
it with respect to time

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.100
as what we've previously
done, but we're now

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.070
going to consider it
with respect to space.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.730
So F equals ma, and
we're going to take

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.130
the x component of that.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.560
And now, we're going
to integrate this.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.380
So Fx dx prime, and it
runs from x prime equals

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.420
x initial to some final value.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.030
And then over here, we're going
to pull the m out. m integral,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.390
and it also goes from some
initial to some final value.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.860
And we're going to have ax dx.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.570
We have previously shown
that this integral here

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.590
is one-half v final squared
minus v initial squared.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.930
And if we're going
to plug this in here,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.910
we're going to get
that this expression is

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.610
one-half mv final squared
minus v initial squared.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.710
And you should
recognize this term.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.060
This is the change
in kinetic energy.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.620
And what we have here,
on the other side,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.200
this integral fx
dx is defined to be

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.789
the work-- work done
on the system, which

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.400
we're going to call w.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.390
And that work done
on the system,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.110
it's change in kinetic energy.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.116
So this is the
work-energy principle.

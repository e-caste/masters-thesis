00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.940
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, I
want to talk today about--

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.490
continue our discussion
of oligopoly.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.980
Last time, we talked about
non-cooperative equilbria,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.100
but in the start, we
said, gee, life would just

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.630
be better off if everyone
would just cooperate.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.160
And someone even asked
me, "Well, why don't they

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.240
just cooperate?"

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.530
So let's talk about that.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.690
Let's talk about cartels.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.960
What happens when firms
try to cooperate--

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.260
achieve the cooperative
equilibrium in oligopolies?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.400
Now, clearly, this is going
to be the best outcome.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.920
So the fixed examples--

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.430
let's go back to our example
of last time, American United.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.880
Recall, last time, we said
that demand was in the form

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.290
339 minus Q. Price
is 339 minus Q.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.850
And that the marginal
cost was 147, OK?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.960
Now, we talked about the
fact that if American

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.220
was a monopoly in this
market, they would simply

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.620
solve the monopolist's problem.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.050
They would set marginal
revenue, which is 339 minus 2Q,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.920
equal to marginal
cost, which is 147,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.580
and they would get that
the optimal Q would be 96.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.530
And then reading back
off the demand curve,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.220
that would imply an optimal
quantity of $243, OK?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.250
So that was what
we got last time.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.800
Now, imagine that American
is not a monopoly,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.145
but American United cooperate.

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:44.270
What if they got together
and said, "You know what?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.290
Let's behave as if we're one
monopolist, flying 96 flights

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.790
and just splitting them equally.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.070
We'll do 48, you do 48.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.900
So let's cartelize.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.930
Let's achieve the
monopoly outcome,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.140
and we'll also share 50-50
the fruits of that outcome."

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.730
So in that case, each
firm would fly 48 flights

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.810
at a price of $243, OK?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.639
And total profits
in the market--

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.270
each firm would then make
profits of 48 times--

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.910
price minus average cost, which
is marginal cost, because it's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.630
flat--

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.140
times 243 minus 147--

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.010
or since I'm not like you guys,
I can't do that in my head--

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.690
4,608 per firm, OK?

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.790
So each firm would
achieve profits of--

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.070
take the 96 flights,
split them in 1/2,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.640
and then each achieve
profits of 4,608.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.250
Now, what we can see
is that these profits

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.470
are much higher
than what they got

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.460
in the non-cooperative
equilibrium.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.350
Remember, the
non-cooperative equilibrium,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.085
they were each doing 64
flights at a price of--

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.970
they were each doing 64
flights at a price of 211.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.650
We saw that last time.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.240
So what were their
non-cooperative profits?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.910
Their non-cooperative
profits for each firm

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.470
was 64 times the 211 they
were charging, minus the 147

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.800
in marginal costs, or their
former profits were 4,096.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.400
So their profits
used to be 4,096

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.910
when they weren't cooperating.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.700
They've gone up by 12.5%
to 4,608 by cooperating.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.730
So simply by getting together,
saying, "Don't be an asshole.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.810
Let's cooperate.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.030
Let's figure how to
make the most money."

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.280
Getting together, they solve
the prisoner's dilemma,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.300
get to the best outcome, and
make a lot more money, OK?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.790
So the question is, why
don't they always do

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.180
this in oligopolistic markets?

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.838
And fundamentally,
there's two reasons.

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:46.380
Now, normal people-- you'll see
when I'm done-- normal people

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.422
will teach them in a
different order than I will.

00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:50.838
But let me start with the two
reasons the other economists

00:03:50.838 --> 00:03:51.780
would teach them.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.810
The first reason why
cartels don't form

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.740
is that they're
fundamentally unstable.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.570
Cartels are fundamentally
unstable as long

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.750
as firms are self-interested.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.420
Each individual firm in a cartel
has an incentive to cheat,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.180
and that's because
they essentially

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.040
can solve the monopoly problem
of poisoning by cheating.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.290
Let me explain how that works.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.420
It's best to see
this through numbers.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.709
Let's imagine that we start in
this cooperative equilibrium,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.330
48 flights each and
profits of 4,608.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.720
And now let's imagine,
that quietly, American

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.875
increased its number of
flights from 48 to 50.

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:32.250
American says, "Well, I know
I agreed 48, but on the sly,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.240
I'm going to fly
two more flights

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.530
and hope they don't catch me."

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.250
OK?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.380
Well, what's American's profits?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.140
Well, their quantity is 50.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.942
Q sub A is now 50.

00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:44.650
What's the price?

00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:49.060
If they're going to do 50
flights, what's the price?

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.620
Yeah?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm sorry?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.805
It's 280-- the price is-- let's
see if you got that right.

00:04:58.805 --> 00:04:59.930
I've got to check my notes.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.550
No, if the price was 243
when they're a monopoly,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.990
now they do two more flights.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.260
Remember, they're adding
two flights to the total.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.330
There used to be 96 flights.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.960
Now it goes to 98 flights.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.608
So the price falls to 241, OK?

00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:20.900
So you were thinking about
them as alone, but remember,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.490
there's still United
doing the flights too.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.930
They're still doing 48 flights.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.640
So there were 96 flights total.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.720
Now it goes to 98.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.360
So the price falls to 241, OK?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.160
So what's their profits?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:42.660
Their profits are now 50
times 241 minus 147, or 4,700.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.420
Their profits have gone up.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.613
OK, let me back up and do it
again because I went fast, OK?

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.530
They say they're going
to do two more flights.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.030
We have to respect
the demand curve.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.697
So there's going to
be two more flights.

00:05:52.697 --> 00:05:54.210
The price has to fall.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.070
If the price falls, then the
price has to fall to 241.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.640
They now make
profits of 4,700, OK?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.010
Well, if United is caught
with their pants down

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.980
and continues to do 48
flights, what does United make?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.200
Well, United's still
doing 48 flights,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:24.250
so the profits of United are 48
times 241 minus 147, or 4,512.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.590
So American's profits are
up and United's profits

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.240
are down through
American cheating.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.190
What happened?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.950
How by cheating did they drop?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.350
What's the intuition of why them
cheating drove their profits up

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.940
and United's down?

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.790
And in fact, if
you add these up,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.210
lowered total profits
in the market.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.560
What's going on?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.492
Yeah.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.430
AUDIENCE: It's in the quantity.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.270
You're lowering the price that
you can sell each unit for,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.042
but for American,
because they're

00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:02.000
increasing the number of
units they're selling,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920
they still make
a greater profit,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.610
whereas as United has stayed
the same, because each unit is

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.610
sold for less, then they're
making less of that.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.152
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's almost right.

00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:13.173
You got most of it, but
there's one key wrinkle

00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:15.090
that's important, which
is, a monopolist would

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.600
have the same argument.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.900
The key thing is, what stops
the monopolist from raising

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.830
the price from where he is?

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.590
Yeah?

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.230
The poisoning effect, but think
about the poisoning effect.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.660
Who does the poisoning
effect affect?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.340
Everyone in the market.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.250
Everyone sees a lower
price, but only American

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.870
gets more flights.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.590
So they essentially
get the benefit.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.173
It's like you said, they get the
benefit of the extra flights,

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:43.010
but only 1/2 the penalty
of the poisoning effect.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.980
So for them, it is optimal to
lower the price and sell more,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.800
because they share the negative
effect, the negative part

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.200
with United, but they get
all the positive part.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.270
Once again, a
monopolist, when you

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.920
try to sell more
and lower the price,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.295
there's a positive
part, which is

00:07:56.295 --> 00:07:58.130
sell more units, but
a negative part, which

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.440
is the poisoning effect.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.940
Well, here, American gets all
the positive part and only 1/2

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.230
the negative part.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.322
So they make money
by cheating, OK?

00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:07.780
Well, of course,
United knows this.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.520
They saw the price go down.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.840
They know American's cheating.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.130
So United wants to cheat, and
the whole thing breaks apart.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.070
So cartels are unstable,
because by cheating, you

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.310
get all the benefit but
only part of the cost.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.720
And so cheating is
incentivized in a cartel,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.520
and therefore, cartels
will break down.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.320
They're not stable, OK?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.419
So that's the primary
reason economists

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.830
say we don't see cartels.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.413
The other reason people like to
bring up is this little thing,

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:37.490
they're illegal.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.289
But you know, we don't
let stuff like that

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.030
bother the economists.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.320
But they are illegal.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.110
That's another reason
why we don't see cartels.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.750
In the late 1800, cartels
were quite common.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.880
In the late 1800s,
big industries

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.216
like oil and railroad
industries came

00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:55.190
to be dominated by
a few large firms,

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.690
and they tried to
become cartels,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.070
but it kept breaking down.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.340
So in the late 1800s, with
oil companies, Standard Oil,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.260
and the big railroad
companies, they

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.420
kept trying to have cartels
and it kept breaking down.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.240
So they come up with this idea.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.518
They basically said, "Look,
we can't trust each other.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:13.310
So we're going to--

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.950
every firm is going to
turn over all its decisions

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.687
to a common trust.

00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:19.770
And there'll be a trust
that's got representatives

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.440
from every firm on the board.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.128
But we will publicly
commit to what

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:25.670
we're going to
produce at what price,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.530
and therefore, we can make
sure there's no cheating."

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.090
So essentially, every
firm's still involved.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.423
They're all on this trust board.

00:09:30.423 --> 00:09:32.917
But they're making that
decision in a way that's

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:35.000
at least public to them,
not public to the public,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.625
but public to them, so they can
make sure they're not cheating.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:40.610
So they formed these trusts,
and essentially cartelized,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.540
and made huge profits.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.380
And it worked.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.570
It solved the stability
problem because cheating

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.370
could be observed more readily.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.830
Now, would it solve this for
very long, we don't know,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.930
because the government--
the public got pissed,

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.472
and the government
came in and passed

00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:55.160
what's called antitrust laws.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.850
And antitrust laws
are laws which

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.830
do not permit the cartelization
of oligopolistic industries

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.220
in this way.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.300
So let's talk about antitrust
laws and how they work

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.490
or how they don't work.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.940
I want to do a couple examples.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.143
One example is the
movie industry.

00:10:12.143 --> 00:10:13.560
Now, the movie
industry, you know,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.030
is a classic
oligopolistic industry.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.437
There's a few players.

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:18.270
There's new players.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.902
A24 is huge now, what
didn't exist 15 years ago.

00:10:21.902 --> 00:10:23.860
But by and large, there's
sort of a few players

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.670
you've heard of which
dominate the industry, OK?

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.050
And the way the industry works
is movie companies make--

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.800
they produce the movies
and then sell them

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.870
to movie theaters
that show the movies.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.340
They show a variety of
movies at any one time.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.150
But what happened was
in the '30s and '40s,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.552
the production companies started
buying up the movie theaters.

00:10:43.552 --> 00:10:45.760
And what they do when they
bought the movie theaters,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.718
they said to the movie
theater, "We now own you

00:10:47.718 --> 00:10:49.695
and you will only
show our movies."

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:51.070
So they say to
the movie theater,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.840
"We now own you, movie theater
on the corner of Lincoln

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.970
and Kennedy streets,
and we're MGM,

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.190
and you'll only
show MGM movies."

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.490
And essentially, what that
meant was essentially,

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.870
they were taking
over, monopolizing,

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.990
a given distribution network.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.620
And they essentially
carved it up.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.620
They agreed, OK, you
get these theaters.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.390
We'll take these theaters.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.970
And essentially, that was the
way they formed their cartel,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.770
was through distribution.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.480
And the federal
government jumped in

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.820
and said that that was
an antitrust violation.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.050
The federal government
sued and won.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.560
And so that industry,
that was broken up.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.310
But did that mean--
that didn't mean folks

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.477
stopped trying to cartelize.

00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:35.980
It just meant they stopping
being so obvious about it.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.980
So later moves to
cartelize were more hidden.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.455
So for example, in
the early 2000s,

00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:43.080
airline industries
were in big trouble,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.247
because oil prices were
going way up due to the Iraq

00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:46.860
war and other factors.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.260
Oil prices were going way
up, and the airline industry

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.640
was in trouble.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.310
So in 2004, British
Airlines and Virgin Atlantic

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.950
had secret talks
about essentially

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.360
cartelizing the cross Atlantic
market from the East Coast

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.090
to London.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.710
And what they did is they said,
"Look, if we sort of obviously

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.463
set our prices together,
people are going to notice.

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:10.880
So to do this
instead, we're going

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.980
to add fuel surcharges
to the bill.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.350
We're going to say, 'Oh, oil
is getting more expensive.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.850
Your price haven't changed, but
there's now a fuel surcharge

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.770
on your bill.'

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.950
And that fuel surcharge is
going to be something people

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.960
won't pay attention to
because they won't notice

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.530
that we're rising it together."

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.240
And these fuel surcharges
rose quickly from $10 to $120

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.935
per flight, and essentially
rose in lockstep.

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:33.560
They essentially
coordinated, but tried

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.030
to hide it by making
the coordination not

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.710
over the sticker price,
but over this thing that's

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.502
sort of at the bottom
of your ticket, which

00:12:38.502 --> 00:12:40.057
is the fuel surcharge.

00:12:40.057 --> 00:12:42.140
So this worked for awhile,
but then what happened?

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.410
Well, what happened was
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.670
Was it lawyers for--

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.580
lawyers for Virgin
Airlines started worrying

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.570
they were to get busted.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.020
And they said, "Well, if we
go to the feds first and bust

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.000
British airlines, maybe
we'll get a better deal."

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.420
So they were essentially
the prisoner that ratted.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.238
So Virgin Atlantic was
the prisoner that ratted,

00:13:05.238 --> 00:13:06.530
and the whole thing broke down.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.488
There were penalties,
more on British Airlines,

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:10.248
because Virgin Atlantic
ratted on them.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.290
But just like the prisoner's
dilemma breaks down,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.723
it broke down in reality.

00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:16.140
And so that was something not
where the law really worked,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.827
but where the
cartel was unstable.

00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:21.410
And the end result
was Virgin Atlantic

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.650
paid no fees, paid no
penalty, and British Airlines

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.612
paid more than $500 million.

00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:28.070
So British Airlines
clearly did not

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.930
study the prisoner's
dilemma, and did not

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.420
realize that they
should have gone first

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.360
in ratting out Virgin Atlantic.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.170
Now, that said,
sometimes cartels

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.590
operate openly in the public
and get away with it, OK?

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.610
Let's talk about probably
the biggest open cartel

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.940
perhaps in America today, the
National Football League, OK?

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.190
The National Football League--

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.607
football is the
most popular sport

00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:56.768
in America, the most
profitable sport in America.

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:58.560
There are 32 teams,
and they're essentially

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.450
32 businesses whose job it is
to produce football wins, OK?

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.880
Now, these businesses
have a huge incentive

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.690
to collude with their
fellow business,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.260
however, because they can--

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.690
because of television rights.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.890
So if the New York Giants
and the New York Jets

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.350
competed over the television
rights for their area,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.810
they would compete
away the profits

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.150
that could be made by
getting a big contract.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.820
If they collude and
say, "No, you can only--

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.580
we will only agree to
a contract together,"

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.680
they could get a higher
price for that contract,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.880
because it's either you
give them the contract

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.463
or you're out.

00:14:33.463 --> 00:14:35.460
If they competed,
TV companies would

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.315
compete against each other
and fight the price down, OK?

00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:40.440
And in general, actually,
this goes more than this.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.220
The League sells the rights to
televise games as a package.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.640
So in fact, the National
Football League literally

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.140
sells, explicitly says, "We
have a cartel of 32 teams.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.140
We are selling the monopoly
right to televise these games."

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.070
Somebody's got Sunday.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.880
Somebody's got Thursday.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.505
Somebody's got Monday
night, et cetera.

00:14:58.505 --> 00:15:00.530
But it's a monopoly
product they're selling.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.280
Now, how did they
get away with that?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.328
Well, basically, actually
1957, they were busted.

00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:07.620
That's a long time ago, I
think even before I was born,

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.600
that long ago.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.220
OK, they were
busted and the court

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.600
ruled that the NFL was
violating antitrust laws, OK?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.130
Now, that was 1957.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.670
That was 60 years ago.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.120
The NFL still makes
about $40 billion

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.830
on its television contract.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.850
What happened?

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.840
Congress just exempted them.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.480
Congress said, "Well,
you know what?"

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.630
We know they violate
antitrust, but we're

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.005
going to pass a law which
exempts them from antitrust law

00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:31.937
and let them do it.

00:15:31.937 --> 00:15:34.270
So it proves basically that
Americans like football more

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.300
than free markets,
and basically, we now

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.230
have a cartelized
football industry that--

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.910
because Congress basically
exempted them from the laws,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.440
OK?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.730
So those are some examples.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.265
Yeah?

00:15:47.265 --> 00:15:49.910
AUDIENCE: Is this also true
for other sports teams?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.310
JONATHAN GRUBER: Other
sports teams, it is not as--

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.430
they are-- it's largely true
for other sports leagues.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.670
It's largely true.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.420
Some of it aren't as
explicit as football,

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.575
but it's largely true for the
other sports leagues as well.

00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:03.575
AUDIENCE: What about on
the international level,

00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:05.043
with things like
soccer, that are--

00:16:05.043 --> 00:16:06.710
JONATHAN GRUBER: I
don't know, actually.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.550
I presume it's--

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.400
I mean, I don't know they have
international antitrust laws.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.692
I'm not sure how that works
with international leagues.

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:14.890
It's a good question.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.338
OK, now, another
form of cartels--

00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:19.255
we talked about cartels
and how companies have

00:16:19.255 --> 00:16:20.650
incentive to put them together.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.940
Actually, sometimes, the
government can make a cartel.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.506
Yeah?

00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:26.440
AUDIENCE: How well
[INAUDIBLE] working?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:26.890
JONATHAN GRUBER: How's what?

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.480
AUDIENCE: How well
is OPEC working?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.640
JONATHAN GRUBER: OPEC?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.930
So OPEC is, as I mentioned
in the first lecture,

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.370
a series of countries that
get together to produce oil.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.640
It's not working as well
as it was when I was a kid.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.557
It worked really well.

00:16:37.557 --> 00:16:40.060
Because more countries-- A,
more countries are cheating,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.602
and more countries--
there's more oil

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:42.850
being found outside OPEC.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.720
But it still works.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.598
It's sort of a partially
functioning cartel,

00:16:45.598 --> 00:16:47.140
is I think the way
to think about it.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.780
OK, so let me actually--

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.140
let me go on and
talk about-- let's

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.950
do one more example
about a time when

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.660
a government made a cartel.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.820
Here's one more
interesting example.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.490
So in the early 1980s,
before the early 1980s,

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.170
the US dominated the
car production business.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.170
Starting in the late '70s, Japan
started making huge inroads

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.450
into car production,
and by the early 1980s,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.140
we're in recession
and car manufacturers

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.710
in the US were really
pissed that Japan was

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.300
taking so much of our market.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.380
And we'll talk in a
couple of lectures

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.030
about international trade
and all those sort of issues,

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.212
but put those issues aside.

00:17:22.212 --> 00:17:23.670
Right now, you just
have this issue

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.500
that car manufacturers
wanted to limit

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.720
the amount of Japanese
cars to come into America.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.553
Now, you guys have been
reading in the paper

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.100
about international trade
and why economists typically

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.130
don't like limiting
international trade.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.920
And Reagan was a
standard Republican,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.570
the party of free trade.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.430
So Reagan said,
"Well, we're not going

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.010
to limit the cars that
Japan wants to send in,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.290
but we're going to tell
Japan, if you guys were

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.700
willing to agree to a
voluntary export restraint,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.575
we wouldn't mind."

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.950
So we said to
Japan, they imposed

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.750
what they called a voluntary
export constraint, which

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.320
basically said, we won't
negotiate a deal with you.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.170
You will voluntarily agree
to reduce the number of cars

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.392
you send to America, OK?

00:18:08.392 --> 00:18:09.600
It's not a government policy.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.890
This isn't big government.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.320
This is negotiations
of a private company,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.850
voluntary agreement.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.440
OK.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.340
Japan happily
agreed to this, why?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.665
Yeah.

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:22.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.780
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.300
AUDIENCE: Sold cars
at higher price.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.490
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because?

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.110
Because you made a cartel.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.700
The Japanese companies used to
have to compete with each other

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.530
to sell the cars in America.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.910
Now it's like, OK,
you guys get together

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.552
and limit how many
cars you send.

00:18:36.552 --> 00:18:38.510
They're like, great,
you've given us an ability

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.343
to form a cartel, by
essentially telling us,

00:18:40.343 --> 00:18:42.510
get together and figure out
how you're going to sell

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.600
this many cars to America.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.100
So essentially, this voluntary
export constraint essentially

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.192
cartelized, and no
company could cheat.

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.400
So if you had a cartel, and
a company tried to cheat,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.530
they couldn't sell
the cars to US.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.250
US wouldn't let them
come into the US.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.140
So essentially, the
US provided them a way

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.940
of enforcing their cartel.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.050
What happened?

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.230
Well, the average price of
a Japanese car in America

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.500
went up by $1,200, OK?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.070
US auto profits did go
up, but US consumers

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.312
lost out by way more
than producers gained.

00:19:12.312 --> 00:19:14.270
And on net, the estimates
are that US consumers

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.380
were about three billion--

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.070
overall, US was about $3 billion
worse because of this policy.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.680
Just examples of how
different government policies

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.680
can interact with the
cartelization of industries.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.870
Yeah.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.000
AUDIENCE: Company price
matches, isn't that sort

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.035
of like making a cartel?

00:19:31.035 --> 00:19:32.660
Because the other
company would see it.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.300
They're going to price match.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.390
They wouldn't want to set a
price lower than what the--

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.265
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
it's a great question,

00:19:37.265 --> 00:19:39.440
and you're pointing out
this is not a solid line.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.800
And in some sense, the
question is, if it's true

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.230
that-- so for many
years, tobacco industry

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.080
worked this way.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.830
There was one large
player, Philip Morris.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.622
Philip Morris would
sort of raise the price

00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:50.930
that everyone would match.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.990
Now, as long as
there's no evidence

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.103
that they agreed to do
that, that is not illegal.

00:19:57.103 --> 00:19:59.520
If there is evidence they
agreed to do that, it's illegal.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.040
But as long as
it's just like, no,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.080
this is the way it's going to
work, then that's not illegal.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.720
So basically, that's sort
of an implicit cartel.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.640
Now, once again, what's
holding it together?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.330
Nothing.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.000
A company could cheat
and try to charge less.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.665
But basically, that
essentially-- they

00:20:13.665 --> 00:20:15.540
figured they were working
better as a cartel,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.915
and essentially,
it was hard to--

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:18.350
there was no way to bust it.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.870
Yeah.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.120
AUDIENCE: I mean, if a company
says to consumers like,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.578
"If you can bring
in a lower price,

00:20:22.578 --> 00:20:23.925
we'll sell it for that price."

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:25.800
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
sort of a different--

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.780
I mean, you could imagine
you would need every company

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.280
to do that.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.780
That would be a
cartel enforcing way

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.000
if every company had
that deal in a market.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.375
But if one company
had that deal,

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.940
it doesn't enforce the cartel.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.650
Every company needs
to have that deal.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.600
And so the question is, if
every company on their own, OK,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.190
we've decided
we're going to have

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.630
that deal, that
would essentially

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.280
be a way of trying to bring--

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.947
enforce a cartel, but
I think that would

00:20:45.947 --> 00:20:49.780
be hard to say it was
an antitrust violation.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.780
Good questions.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.280
Other questions?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.340
OK, so now, let's ask why
do we care about all this.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.545
We care about all this because
it matters for ultimately

00:20:58.545 --> 00:21:00.170
what matters to us
in this class, which

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.360
is economic welfare, OK?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.500
So now, let's go to a second
thing I want to cover,

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.100
which is comparing
the equilbria.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.310
We've now covered three
types of market structures,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.870
perfect competition,
monopoly, and oligopoly.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.526
Now, let's compare
them, and I want

00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:23.320
to compare them in two
ways, quantity sold

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:32.590
and profits per firm,
profits earned per firm.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.260
And we're going to stick with
the United, American market,

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.980
OK?

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.550
We know, if this is a monopoly,
if this is a monopoly,

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.640
if they can perfectly
cartelize, then

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.300
there'll be 96 flights total.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.330
Each will fly 48 flights, and
profits per firm will be 4,608.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.600
OK, we solved that already.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.790
That's the cartel outcome.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.970
The non-cooperative
outcome, which

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.990
we call the oligopoly outcome,
is they each sell 64 flights.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.535
We solved that last time.

00:22:04.535 --> 00:22:12.263
And as we solved here, they
each make profits of 4,096.

00:22:12.263 --> 00:22:14.180
What's the competitive
outcome in this market?

00:22:18.093 --> 00:22:20.010
What's the competitive
outcome in this market?

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.300
First of all, what's the price?

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.350
Somebody raise their
hand and tell me.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.700
If this is a perfectly
competitive market,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.850
what would the price be?

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.353
And then what would
the quantity be?

00:22:26.353 --> 00:22:26.696
Yeah.

00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:27.040
AUDIENCE: 147.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.080
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Price would be 147,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.830
because in a perfectly
competitive market,

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.380
price would be marginal cost.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.855
So profits would be?

00:22:32.855 --> 00:22:33.480
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.160
JONATHAN GRUBER: Zero.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:43.050
And quantity would be 339
minus 147, or 192, OK?

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.550
So here we have,
for a given market,

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.950
a nice table which
lets us compare

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.170
the three different
possible outcomes.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.950
And what you see is
essentially, the more you

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.970
can monopolize, the higher
your profits but the smaller

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.110
the market, OK?

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.390
So basically,
three lessons here.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.240
First of all,
generally speaking,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.680
the oligopoly
outcome is somewhere

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.972
between the monopoly and
perfectly competitive outcome.

00:23:08.972 --> 00:23:12.040
Where in between, take 14, 12.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.790
If 14, 12 was bad,
it's how you figure out

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.040
where in between this outcome
comes between these two.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.832
It's all about game theory, OK?

00:23:17.832 --> 00:23:19.790
So that's what's exciting
about game theory is,

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.820
this is a wide range,
and game theory

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.360
is a set of
sophisticated tools that

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.350
let us pin down
where in this range

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.340
companies will end up
in a realistic case.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.650
0.2 is, the more
you can monopolize,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.040
the higher your profits will be.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.660
But let us come to welfare.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.420
Now, I haven't computed
social surplus here.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.270
But here's the cheat,
I don't really need to.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.390
I don't need to because
essentially, roughly speaking,

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.380
social welfare is proportional
to the quantity sold.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.920
In other words, we know that in
a perfectly competitive market,

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.520
this is-- the welfare-maximizing
quantity is 192.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.010
We know that there's 192
flights that maximize welfare,

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.230
because that's the
competitive outcome.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.670
What we're saying is the more--

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.712
Oh, this shouldn't be 64.

00:24:01.712 --> 00:24:02.700
It should be 128.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.160
That's my bad.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.960
128.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.060
It's each doing 64.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.680
We know that as we
monopolize the market,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.440
there are fewer
and fewer flights.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.420
Therefore, we're creating
a deadweight loss.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.480
Essentially, deadweight
loss is proportional--

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.450
actually, it's sort of
exponentially proportional--

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.030
to the gap between
the quantity sold

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.790
and the competitive quantity.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.780
Welfare is maximized
here by definition.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.188
We proved that.

00:24:33.188 --> 00:24:35.730
So any reduction for that means
it increased deadweight loss.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.770
So the more you reduce quantity,
the more you lower welfare.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.460
So essentially, as we
go down the column,

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.010
we lower profits but
raise social welfare.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.478
Yeah.

00:24:45.478 --> 00:24:47.270
AUDIENCE: When we're--
I'm not really sure.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.850
Are we talking
about an oligopoly

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.170
that acts like a monopoly?

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.300
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yeah, cartel/monopoly.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.800
AUDIENCE: So there's
[INAUDIBLE]----

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.690
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.030
But otherwise, you do 96, your
profits would be twice that.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.330
But the bottom line is
that essentially, you've

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.830
got essentially more
profits in this market.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.830
OK?

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.340
Other questions about that?

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.180
So the bottom line is, the
more competitive the market,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.370
the higher the welfare, but
the lower the profits, OK?

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.180
So that's kind of
our bottom line

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.630
of how we think about this.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.490
Questions about that?

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.780
OK, next I want to cover--

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.680
we've only covered
the case of two firms.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.720
What if there are many firms?

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.200
After all, most oligopoly
markets are not just two firms.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.040
We've talked about cars and
movie producing studios.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.970
There are many firms, OK?

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.825
Well, the Cournot model is super
hard to do when there's more

00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:52.450
firms, but there's
no reason you can't.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.090
It literally just becomes three
equations and three unknowns

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.590
or four equations
and four unknowns.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.990
Literally, as you can
see, you could simply see,

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.240
if you take that model
and add more firms,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.680
it just expands the state space.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.440
It becomes impossible the
graph, but you could solve it.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.120
Eventually, you've got n
equations and n unknowns.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.810
The key bottom line result
is that as the Cournot--

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.530
as the number of
firms gets large,

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.270
the Cournot
equilibrium approaches

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.130
the competitive equilibrium.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.840
That is mathematically,
if you solve

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.382
this-- you don't
have to solve this--

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:29.850
but the bottom line condition
is, the markup that firms earn

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:36.270
is equal to minus 1 over
n times the elasticity.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.405
In sort of a market--

00:26:37.405 --> 00:26:39.780
this is sort of in a symmetric
Cournot market of the kind

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.100
we've been working with.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.490
The markup is 1 over
the number of firms

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.745
times the elasticity of demand.

00:26:49.745 --> 00:26:51.120
So think about
this for a second.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.800
Imagine there is one firm.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.050
Then this equation says the
market is equal to minus 1

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.490
over the elasticity of demand.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.660
Where have we seen that before?

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.220
That's the monopoly condition.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.870
That's the monopoly
market condition.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.360
So when n equals 1, this is
an equation we've seen before,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.400
the monopoly market condition.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.040
When n equals 2, the firms
are making 1/2 as much.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.870
When n equals 3, a third--

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.420
it goes a fact-- factor
third, et cetera.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.360
What this says is n
approaches infinity,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.590
we approach a
competitive outcome.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.490
We'll never get there,
but we're asymptoting

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.618
towards a competitive outcome,
which basically says--

00:27:29.618 --> 00:27:32.160
you know, it's sort of like my
point about contested markets.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.090
You get a market that's
sort of competitive enough,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.340
you're going to shrink the
markup as more and more firms

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.080
enter, OK?

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.740
So that's sort of a general
condition that we could derive,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:49.920
that shows that as
more firms are in,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.130
then you get a lower markup.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.060
Now, I want to make--

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.810
there's actually--

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.340
But this actually
understates the case,

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.410
for an important
strategic reason,

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.100
which is, more firms
lowers the markup in a--

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.060
more firm lowers the markup in
a Cournot non-cooperative model.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:12.080
But more firms also makes
a cooperative model harder.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.025
So this is for the
non-cooperative model.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:15.650
The non-cooperative
model, your profits

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.060
fall as there more firms.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.770
But it also gets
harder to cooperate

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.090
as there are more
firms, because there

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.030
are more people
you have to trust,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.590
more people you have
to keep hold of.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.580
So a great example of this,
actually, for a long time,

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.760
mercury, the stuff we use
in thermometers and such,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.040
only was found in
Italy and Spain,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.660
in the mines in Italy and Spain.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.270
And they had a cartel
between the two countries

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.100
to sell mercury.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.598
What happened, other
countries discovered mercury,

00:28:42.598 --> 00:28:44.390
and they couldn't keep
the cartel together,

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.130
and the price of
mercury fell a lot.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.170
With the question about
OPEC, similar thing--

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.980
OPEC was much more successful
in the 1970s, when essentially,

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.460
the only source of oil were
basically these Arab nations

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.658
that form OPEC.

00:28:56.658 --> 00:28:58.700
What happened over time
is we discovered more oil

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.690
around the world, in particular,
in Russia and in the US, which

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.050
has sort of broken the power of
this cartel to a large extent.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.110
So the reason why a
bigger market moves us

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.580
towards a competitive
equilibrium

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.110
is that it makes it harder
to maintain a cartel, OK?

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.940
Now, let's actually-- the other
issue I want to cover here

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.820
is, I want to talk about
what does all this teach us

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.495
about a key policy issue,
which is the issue of mergers?

00:29:27.495 --> 00:29:29.120
What does everything
we've learned here

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.660
tell us about thinking
about mergers?

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.890
OK, we know about mergers.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:34.890
It happens all the time.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.460
Two companies merge.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.270
Well, it turns out
when companies merge

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.310
and they're large enough,
the federal government

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.018
regulates that.

00:29:42.018 --> 00:29:43.560
The federal government
gets a vote on

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.700
whether that merger
is going to be allowed

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.130
to go forward, either
the Department of Justice

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.880
or the Federal Trade
Commission, depending

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.810
on what industry it is.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.700
So the federal
government has to decide

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.600
how to evaluate whether two
firms merging is a good idea

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.540
or not, and essentially,
what it comes down to

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:07.750
is a simple trade-off, economies
of scale versus market power.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.700
The benefit of two firms
merging is economies of scale.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.580
If two firms have sort of
redundant production processes

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.130
and they merge, they
can be more efficient.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.070
There can be positive economies
of scale for merging firms.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.900
So it's cost
efficiencies, basically.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.310
Economies of scale
deliver cost efficiencies.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.220
On the other hand,
the more firms merge,

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.340
the more this n goes down,
and the more markets go up,

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.960
and the worse it
is for consumers.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.150
So the trade-off is,
do you want to reduce--

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.900
is reducing n worth it in terms
of the economies of scale?

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.870
Or in other words, does
the producer efficiency

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:51.900
go up enough to make up
for the potential loss

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.420
to consumers of this less
competitive market, OK?

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.607
People understand that?

00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:00.190
Now an interesting
case of this, which

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.950
has got very big implications
for all of us in America,

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.440
is hospital mergers.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.980
During the decade
of the 2000s, there

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.110
was a rash of hospital mergers,
where hospitals said, look,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.210
here's a classic case
for economies of scale,

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.360
because hospitals have what's
called a peak load problem.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.950
They have to have empty beds.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.570
Hospitals can't be
full all the time,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.400
because there might be a car
accident, and people need beds.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.400
So by definition, it's
inefficient for hospitals

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.170
to be 100% capacity.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.150
Hospitals want to
have excess capacity.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.530
The problem with that,
there's two hospitals

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.540
next to each other, each
with excess capacity,

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.840
that's inefficient.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.840
It'd be more efficient
to have one hospital, one

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.173
merged hospital, then they
just manage the proper amount

00:31:37.173 --> 00:31:39.015
of excess capacity.

00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:40.390
And hospitals made
this argument,

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.910
and we basically approved
any hospital merger

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.330
that they wanted in the 2000s.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.620
Well, what happened?

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.940
What happened is
the hospitals lied.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.690
They kept both hospitals
open, kept all the empty beds,

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.920
and just raised prices.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.420
So essentially, the
hospital mergers

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.295
did not deliver any of
the economies of scale

00:31:57.295 --> 00:31:59.950
they promised, but did deliver
a lot of the market power

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.540
we feared.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.090
So a huge cause of the
increase in medical spending

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.940
in the 2000s was these
hospital mergers,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.840
which essentially took a lot
of the competitive pressure out

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.870
of the medical market
and didn't really deliver

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.690
economies of scale.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.820
And this is the hard part
of being a regulator.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.820
Most of what public policy
economists do in the world

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.410
is regulate.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.035
All over the world,
there are thousands

00:32:24.035 --> 00:32:26.368
of economists employed all
over the world, hundreds of--

00:32:26.368 --> 00:32:27.930
tens of thousands,
whose job it is

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.280
to make regulatory
decisions of this nature,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.950
and they're really hard.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.340
Because we've drawn nice,
clean theoretical models here,

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.300
but we have to know
what's epsilon.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.320
You know, how much--

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.570
what's epsilon, to figure
out the effect to consumers.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:43.903
What are the economies of scale?

00:32:43.903 --> 00:32:46.570
Will they exploit those
economies of scale, et cetera?

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.460
So these are really hard
and interesting decisions.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.680
Now, let's go on to the last
topic I want to cover today,

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.876
which is price competition.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.080
Price competition.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.220
Now, the models we've
been discussing so far

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.730
have been what we call quantity
competition, that United

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:16.940
and American compete on
how many flights to send,

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.080
and then the demand curve tells
them what they can charge.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.670
But in fact, in many markets,
that's not how firms compete.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:23.920
In fact, we even mentioned it.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.770
Someone mentioned about best
price offers, et cetera.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:30.880
They don't compete on quantity,
they compete on price,

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.980
and that's a
different model, named

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.260
after another French economist.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.553
A model of Bertrand
competition is

00:33:40.553 --> 00:33:42.220
a model of price
competition, is a model

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.260
we call Bertrand competition.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.700
This model says that basically,
two firms compete over

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.690
what price to set,
and then the quantity

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.830
is determined by the price that
results from that competition.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.330
So they don't compete
over quantity.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.460
They compete over price,
and the demand curve then

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.120
tells you the quantity, OK?

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.970
Now, in this case, what's
really striking about Bertrand

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.469
competition is that
unlike the Cournot model,

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.600
under Bertrand
competition, two firms

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.389
can be enough to get us to
the competitive equilibrium.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.572
Why?

00:34:17.572 --> 00:34:19.280
Why do we only
potentially need two firms

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.270
to get to the
competitive equilibrium?

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.770
Yeah.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.937
AUDIENCE: I'll do you lower.

00:34:21.937 --> 00:34:24.478
JONATHAN GRUBER: Why don't you
explain a little bit more what

00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:25.150
you mean?

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.159
AUDIENCE: One firm [INAUDIBLE]
the other one what price are

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.097
lower, and like--

00:34:29.097 --> 00:34:30.139
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.090
As long as there's
profits to be made,

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.520
it's like our entry/exit
decision, right?

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.409
As long as there's
profits to be made,

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.750
I'm going to come in at a
price one penny below you,

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.210
make one penny less profits,
and steal all the business

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.780
from you.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.030
So if there's perfect
competition between firms

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.800
in a Bertrand
sense, then you only

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.110
need two firms to get to
the competitive equilibrium

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.510
in theory, OK?

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.159
So it's a very different idea.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.520
Cournot competition, we
need many, many firms

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.770
to get close to this
competitive outcome.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.110
With price competition,
because firms are always

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.370
kind of competing on one
penny below each other,

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.090
in a market that's
otherwise competitive,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.167
you can actually drive the price
to competitive price through--

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:12.250
essentially, you can
actually drive the price down

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.743
to marginal cost.

00:35:13.743 --> 00:35:15.910
It's sort of like I talked
about contestable markets

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.370
and as long as there's profit
to be made, someone would enter.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.570
Here, as long as there's
profit to be made,

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.362
someone will lower
their price, and that'll

00:35:21.362 --> 00:35:24.570
keep happening until price
equals marginal cost.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.730
So in Bertrand
competition, you actually

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.030
can get close to or at--
to the competitive outcome

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.170
with a small number firms.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.620
Now, two points to
make about this.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.800
Your first point
is, well, holy shit,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.082
how do I say which
one of these to use?

00:35:40.082 --> 00:35:41.040
You've just taught me--

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.373
you've just spent a lecture
and 1/2 on this fancy model,

00:35:43.373 --> 00:35:45.978
spent 37 seconds on this model.

00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:47.270
How do I know which one to use?

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.640
You didn't write down any math,
so I don't know what to do.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.910
I'm freaking out.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.740
OK, how do I know
which one to use?

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.198
Well, the bottom
line is, we're not

00:35:53.198 --> 00:35:55.698
going to ask you to do much
math about Bertrand competition,

00:35:55.698 --> 00:35:58.390
other than sort of the intuition
about competing over price.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.340
The more relevant
question is, how do you

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.643
think about the situations
where Cournot competition is

00:36:03.643 --> 00:36:05.810
more likely and Bertrand
competition is more likely?

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:06.770
So what do you think?

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.570
In what types of
markets do you think

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.510
Cournot competition
would be more likely,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.355
and what kinds of markets do
you think Bertrand competition

00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:14.230
would be more likely?

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.642
Yeah.

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:19.350
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
the Bertrand be really

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.387
efficient in an elastic market?

00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:22.470
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, no.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.730
Elasticity is the same.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.970
So basically,
elasticity is going

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.440
to have a similar
effect in both.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.740
It's going to basically drive
the price down in both, OK?

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.990
Because the elasticity is
higher, it drove the markup.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.317
Bertrand, it's going
to drive down in both.

00:36:36.317 --> 00:36:37.900
So it's not actually
about elasticity.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.960
It's something about
production processes.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.968
What type of
production processes

00:36:41.968 --> 00:36:44.010
are going to lend themselves
to price competition

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.520
versus quantity competition?

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.260
Think about it this
way, if I offer a price,

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.897
what do I have to do?

00:36:52.897 --> 00:36:55.230
AUDIENCE: I think the better
the production is dominated

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.362
by the capital costs, or is it
[INAUDIBLE] the variable costs?

00:36:59.362 --> 00:37:01.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
roughly speaking right.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.550
Basically, if there's
long lags in production,

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.480
I can't do price competition.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.670
So if I say I'm going to
compete, people would say,

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.045
"Great, I want
all your product."

00:37:10.045 --> 00:37:12.110
I'm like, great, you
can have it in a year.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.870
That doesn't work.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.050
So things like
auto companies are

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.527
going to have a hard time
with pure price competition,

00:37:19.527 --> 00:37:21.860
because if Toyota says, "OK,
I'm $1 less," someone says,

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.390
"OK, great.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:26.200
We want a million Toyotas
tomorrow," they can't do it.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.420
So things which are
capital-intensive lagged

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.678
production processes it's
going to be hard to have pure--

00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:33.970
real life, of course, there
could be some mix of these.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.307
But it will tend more
towards quantity competition,

00:37:36.307 --> 00:37:38.890
because you're really going to
know what you're going to sell,

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.300
because that's sort of-- you
can't just infinitely supply

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:41.800
it.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.110
With other things
like cereal sales,

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.615
where you can sort
of immediately

00:37:46.615 --> 00:37:48.240
crank up a million
more boxes of cereal

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.198
in like a day out of your
production processes,

00:37:50.198 --> 00:37:52.330
there would be more likely
to be price competition.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.723
Things with small
production lags,

00:37:54.723 --> 00:37:56.890
then you'd be more likely
to have price competition,

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:58.540
because if you lower the
price, all of the sudden,

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.540
you dominate the market.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.520
You can meet that demand, OK?

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.880
So essentially, we can think
about price competition

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.415
as being more likely the
smaller the production lag,

00:38:09.415 --> 00:38:11.790
or maybe the less capital--
it's not really about capital

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.270
intensity, because you
can have a capital--

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.620
you can create things quickly.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.090
It's more about production lags.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:20.170
Now, we're never going to ask
you to tell us which is right,

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.565
and of course, in reality,
it lies somewhere in between.

00:38:22.565 --> 00:38:24.190
But this just gives
you a sense of kind

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.720
of when one type of competition
is more likely than the other.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.358
Yeah?

00:38:29.358 --> 00:38:30.900
AUDIENCE: Does it
have anything to do

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.430
[INAUDIBLE] to protect the
cereal in the grocery store?

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.120
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great segue.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.720
You've jumped ahead to the
last point I want to make,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.920
which is, imagine you're in
a Bertrand competition world,

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.480
like with cereal.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.180
That's a pretty awful world
if you're a producer, OK?

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.972
Basically, that's where
your markup's tiny,

00:38:48.972 --> 00:38:50.805
because any time you
try to raise the price,

00:38:50.805 --> 00:38:51.880
you get undercut.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.320
What can you do?

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.030
Well, we've already
gotten the answer.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.740
What you can do
is you can engage

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.650
in product differentiation.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:08.820
You can engage in
product differentiation.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:14.090
OK, so basically, the reason why
you're in Bertrand competition

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.530
is because you're
selling the same thing.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.800
Once I'm selling
something different,

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.840
I take on the features
of a monopolist again.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.500
So if I can get consumers
to not think of my good

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.630
as identical to my
competitors, then I

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.470
can price above marginal cost,
and people would still buy it.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.260
The reason Bertrand competition
drives price to marginal cost

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.853
is because people view
the goods as identical.

00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.770
But if they don't view
the goods as identical,

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.770
then I can keep price
above marginal cost, OK?

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.270
And the example--
breakfast cereals

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.560
is the perfect way
to illustrate this.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.380
So back around
World War II, there

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.680
were essentially basically
like three types of cereal, OK?

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.880
There was Cheerios, there was
cornflakes, and Quaker oats.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.470
OK, that's basically what
cereal was, not very exciting.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:03.870
Now, but by 1970, there were
more than 150 breakfast cereals

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.470
to choose from,
including some which

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.960
are variations of Cheerios
and variation of cornflakes.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.220
In fact, you could
all say in some sense,

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.762
all cereal is
variations of Cheerios,

00:40:11.762 --> 00:40:14.330
and cornflakes, and oats.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.740
And then-- and moreover now,
if you go to a store today,

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.580
you can actually buy generic
versions of brand name cereal.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.920
You can buy Oatios
or Marshmallow

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.680
Mateys, which are Lucky Charms,
or what's the other one?

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.120
I love buying these big bags.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.665
You guys ever buy
these generic Lucky

00:40:30.665 --> 00:40:31.790
Charms, Marshmallow Mateys.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.560
Generic Captain Crunch
is like, you know,

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.640
Ahoy Matey or something.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.350
I don't know.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.475
They've got these generic
things which you can buy,

00:40:38.475 --> 00:40:40.770
which are really just the same.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:45.522
So essentially, what
you do-- what companies

00:40:45.522 --> 00:40:47.730
want to always do, which
are in Bertrand competition,

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.668
is always try to
product differentiate,

00:40:49.668 --> 00:40:51.960
always try to figure out a
way they can create a market

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.640
where they can price
above marginal cost, OK?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.780
So for example, let's take
General Mills, a company that

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.180
makes Cheerios, OK?

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.790
They're making
Cheerios, and then

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.040
all of a sudden, Oatios and
stuff started coming along

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.490
and they weren't making money.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.232
What do they do?

00:41:10.232 --> 00:41:11.940
They created different
kinds of Cheerios,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.567
like Apple Cinnamon Cheerios.

00:41:13.567 --> 00:41:15.900
General Mills did not create
Apple Cinnamon Cheerios out

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.192
of the goodness of their heart.

00:41:17.192 --> 00:41:19.067
General Mills created
Apple Cinnamon Cheerios

00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:21.490
because they were getting
killed in the Cheerio market,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.160
and so they tried
to differentiate

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.543
by having a new
product on which they

00:41:26.543 --> 00:41:28.710
could charge a higher price,
which is Apple Cinnamon

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.630
Cheerios.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.240
Now, how do we feel about this?

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.800
Well, it's not clear.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.530
On the one hand, by introducing
Apple Cinnamon Cheerios,

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.350
General Mills was able
to push its price greater

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.210
than marginal cost.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.160
And as price pushed
above marginal cost,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.610
quantity sold in
the market falls.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.800
It created deadweight loss.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.190
Quantity fell, and
that's bad, OK?

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.940
On the other hand,
Apple Cinnamon Cheerios

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.020
are quite good, OK?

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.570
So it actually ends up
being much like our patent

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.580
discussion, which
is, essentially,

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.340
by differentiating,
they've had two effects.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.300
They've lowered consumer
surplus and welfare

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.210
by pricing above marginal
cost, but raised it

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.760
by shifting up the demand
curve, by creating a new good

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.480
that people want.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.800
Yeah.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.475
AUDIENCE: Isn't like-- doesn't
like consumer [INAUDIBLE] not

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.850
necessarily have to happen,
because then different people

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.150
have different demand
curves, and the demand

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.310
curve for like Apple
Cinnamon Cheerios is not--

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.290
hasn't been this good.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.980
JONATHAN GRUBER:
No, the point is--

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.170
OK, it's another way
of stating my point.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.430
Even if the demand curve--

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.210
let's say there's a new demand
curve for Apple Cinnamon

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:40.710
Cheerios.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.210
It's way out, OK?

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.790
That's great, OK?

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.290
But still, the fact that they're
pricing above marginal cost

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.280
means they'll sell
fewer than they

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.630
would in a competitive market.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.160
If they had invented
Apple Cinnamon Cheerios

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.810
and sold it at marginal cost,
they'd still be way better off.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.450
So the trade-off
is, essentially,

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.150
how far out do we shift demand
by creating this new product,

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:58.920
versus how much do
we restrict sales

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.020
by pricing it above
marginal cost?

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.140
So essentially--
now, and now what

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.670
we have is a market with about
five firms that dominate it,

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:11.610
and about 5,000
brands of cereal, OK?

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.250
So it's constant
product differentiation.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.962
And essentially,
this is the trade-off

00:43:16.962 --> 00:43:18.420
with product
differentiation, which

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.730
is we get reduced sale--
we get deadweight loss,

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:23.730
because they're not pricing
it at marginal cost,

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.120
but we get new products
that people might like.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.980
Yeah.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.455
AUDIENCE: So if there's
a product with like--

00:43:30.455 --> 00:43:31.830
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Differentiation.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, differentiation.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.606
Is brand loyalty between
things like Adidas and Nike,

00:43:37.606 --> 00:43:40.480
or like, Apple and Android,
where there are various

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.566
[INAUDIBLE] where you
feel strongly towards one,

00:43:42.566 --> 00:43:44.672
is that good for both
of the two things

00:43:44.672 --> 00:43:45.880
That you're choosing between?

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, actually,
that's really interesting.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.250
It depends on whether that
brand loyalty is based

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.340
on innovation or blind faith.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.835
So this is, once
again, this gets

00:43:55.835 --> 00:43:57.210
into the deep,
interesting issues

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.790
of industrial organization.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.300
You talk about
game theory, which

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:07.270
is, if I can create brand
loyalty in a way that makes you

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:11.110
slightly better off, but
keeps you in my brand forever,

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:12.152
then that might be worse.

00:44:12.152 --> 00:44:14.443
By creating it in a way that
makes you much better off,

00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:15.340
that might be better.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.640
So essentially, that's
why, for example, you

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.550
may have noticed you may be
getting one or two credit card

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.020
mailers.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.840
Are you guys getting inundated
with credit card offers?

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.420
OK, it's not because
they love you guys.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.570
It's because if
they hook you now,

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.240
then you might stick with
that credit card later.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.320
So trying to exploit--

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.695
trying to get you, they're
trying to give you a good deal

00:44:38.695 --> 00:44:40.220
now to get you
hooked later, so they

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.440
can charge up closer to
monopoly price later on.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.260
So essentially,
there's a trade-off,

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.510
which is, if that loyalty
is based on real differences

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.802
in quality, that might be good.

00:44:48.802 --> 00:44:50.677
If it's not, it might
not be, but the welfare

00:44:50.677 --> 00:44:51.380
gets very murky.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.580
It's a good question.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.330
Other questions?

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.300
OK, so these are exciting
real world topics.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.710
It's more reasons to go on
and study more economics.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:59.950
But let's stop now.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.800
We will come back and
we'll start talking

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.240
about factor markets on Monday.

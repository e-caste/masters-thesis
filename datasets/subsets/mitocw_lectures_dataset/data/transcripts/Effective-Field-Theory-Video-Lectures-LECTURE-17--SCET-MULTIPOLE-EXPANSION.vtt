00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.220
IAIN STEWART: All right, so this
is where we got to last time.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.970
So we were on the road to
deriving the leading order SCET

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.140
Lagrangian.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.000
We said that there
were some things

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.080
that we had to deal with,
in particular expanding it.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.140
And we started out,
as a first step,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.200
getting rid of two of the
components of the field

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
that we said are not going
to be ones that we project

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.240
onto in the high energy limit.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.100
And that led us to this
Lagrangian right here,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920
but we haven't yet expanded it.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.070
We haven't yet separated
the ultra soft and collinear

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.050
momenta or the ultra soft
and collinear gauge fields.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.569
And so in order to
do that, I argued

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.700
that you have to make
multipole expansion.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.200
And I talked a
little bit about what

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.915
the multipole expansion would
look like in position space.

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:13.540
And then I said, it's better for
us to do it in momentum space.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.623
And we started to do that.

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:16.833
And we're going to
continue to do that today.

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:18.875
So first of all, let's
just go to momentum space.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.640
So I've called the field here--
since it's not the final field

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.600
that we want, I introduced a
crummy notation for it, Cn hat.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.870
And once we get to the final
field, it won't have a hat.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.600
And that'll be the one that
we keep using from then on.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.380
So let's take this hatted guy,
which is not the final guy,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.560
Fourier transform him and
talk about doing things

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.120
in momentum space.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.123
In momentum space, I'm
going to make an analogy

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:43.165
with what we did in HQET.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:46.535
In HQET, we split the
momentum into two pieces.

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:48.910
We had a piece that was large
and a piece that was small.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.140
And then we could expand.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.060
I'm going to do the
same thing here,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.190
split it into a large
piece and a small piece

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.110
where I'll call the
large pieces the one

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.933
in the lambda components.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.350
And then the small
piece will just

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.990
be all the pieces that are
of order lambda squared.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.850
So if you draw a picture for
this, it looks as follows.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.250
How should I think about
what I'm doing here?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.900
Here's how I want you
to think about it.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.030
So let's draw a two-dimensional
picture in minus perp space.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.510
In plus space, there's no split
because there's no plus here.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.652
So it's really in the
minus and the perp space

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:26.860
that we have to make a split.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.880
Yeah, let's see.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.385
All right, so I'm
going to draw a grid.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.290
And the way I want to
make this split precise

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.970
is I'm going to think--

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.910
OK, so I should have maybe made
my axes in a different color

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.392
to distinguish
them from the grid.

00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:02.435
Let's make them orange.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.090
So the way I want to think
about these two types of momenta

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.520
is I'm going to think about
these Pl's as discrete

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.870
and the Pr's as continuous.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.930
So let's think about
the Pl's as labeling

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.960
these points at
the center of each

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.810
of these boxes in the grid.

00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:33.400
This one was supposed to be--

00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:42.110
that's fine.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.730
My squares are
not the same size,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.680
but they roughly should be.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.140
And so then we can think
about, if we specify

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.650
some momentum in the space--

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.550
let's say we specify momentum
that points to this point right

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.307
here.

00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:54.890
The way that I can
point to that point

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.810
is I take one vector that
points to the center.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.150
And then I take
another small vector

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.400
that points to that point.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.990
The large vector is the Pl.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.990
The small vector is the Pr.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.970
OK, so this guy here is Pl.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:22.730
Maybe I should make the other
one a different color, Pr.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.700
And so the way that we
should think about this

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.902
is in the following sense.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.610
We should think about
the average spacing

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.697
in between these
grid points here

00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:36.530
is something that gets
a power counting that

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.170
makes it of order Q lambda.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.460
And the average spacing between
grid points in this direction

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.360
is something that
makes it order 1.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.880
But if I ask about
distances inside a box,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.153
if I ask about a
distance like this one,

00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:53.445
that's of order lambda squared.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.750
So to get between
boxes, you need

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.480
to make a big jump to
the larger momentum.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.510
But to move around in a box,
that's only small momenta.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.360
AUDIENCE: So why can't
you have order lambda

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.668
basically inside the box
in the P minus dimension?

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:16.460
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.280
So you could.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.785
So you can ask, where is in
order lambda momentum in the P

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:23.285
minus?

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:24.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.420
IAIN STEWART: And
it's in a nether land.

00:05:31.513 --> 00:05:32.930
Either way, you
can think about it

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.550
as being part of
this one or that one.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.300
It doesn't matter.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.730
Because technically, if I
just talked about minus,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.740
I'd only be interested
in separating a 1

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.240
and a lambda squared.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.760
And whether I call this
lambda squared or I call it

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.630
lambda or I call it eta--

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.880
let eta equal lambda squared--

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.950
I'm only trying to
separate two things.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.082
So if you talk about some
momentum that's in between,

00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:58.040
you could ask the same
question actually about,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.572
what about a lambda to the 3/2
momentum in the perp space?

00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:05.030
And that's the same question
you just asked about the minus

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.862
space, right?

00:06:06.862 --> 00:06:08.570
And that's something
that we don't really

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.850
care about because there's
not going to be momenta

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.797
that are scaling like that.

00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:14.630
So we don't really care
about separating it.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.275
OK, so Pl are
discrete grid points.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.760
And Pr-- continuous.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.500
And this picture also makes
clear that, if you take any P,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.750
it uniquely is given
by some Pl and some Pr.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.300
If I point at any
place in this grid,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.760
you can tell me exactly
which Pl I should pick

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.190
and then what Pr I should pick.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.252
This is, in some ways,
just going to be a tool.

00:07:00.252 --> 00:07:01.960
And in the end of the
day, we can kind of

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.085
dispense with this picture.

00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:07.030
But it'll be a useful way of
thinking about what's going on

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.680
and getting to sort of the
final results that allow us

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.930
to dispense with this picture.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.060
So what about integration?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.750
So if I integrate over
all P and P is collinear,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.890
what does that mean?

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.210
So it corresponds to summing
over all the grid points

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:33.280
and then integrating
over all the residuals

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.720
except for one location.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.210
And that's the special box
here that has label equal 0

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.580
because we know that the power
counting of the collinear

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.940
momentum is such that it
always has to have a non-0 Pl.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.000
And so the one box where
Pl is equal to 0, 0,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.225
that particular box doesn't
have a collinear momentum.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.710
And actually, that
box is exactly what

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.590
you think of as the
ultra soft momentum.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:21.010
So if you have an integral
d4P and P is ultra soft,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.870
there's no sum.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.240
And you just have interval d4Pr.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.590
And that's like integrating over
the 0, 0 location in the grid.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.960
OK, so you can see
that together we

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.620
cover all possible places
for an integration.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.280
And we actually don't
do any double counting

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:51.970
with this setup.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.600
What am I going to
do with my fields?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.360
Well, because of this split
into two different pieces,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.020
I'm going to say that my fields
actually can be labeled by Pl

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:12.320
and carry Pr also as an
index or as a function of Pr.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.300
So in order to
make this explicit,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.260
we're going to write
our Fourier transform

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:28.340
guy with a label Pl and
an argument Pr like that.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.630
So the name label comes from
the fact that we do this.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.660
And there will be some
analogies with why

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.380
we called this a label in HQET.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.220
We'll see to what extent
that analogy carries through

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.360
in a minute.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.260
Another thing you should
note from this grid picture

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.300
is that you have separate
momentum conservation

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.550
in the label and the residual.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:17.150
So if you think about some
integral d4x of something

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:27.202
that you split between label
pieces and residual pieces,

00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:28.910
then the right way of
thinking about this

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:35.780
is that you have a discrete
[INAUDIBLE] delta for the label

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.650
and then a continuous
Dirac delta

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.584
for the continuous variables.

00:10:42.584 --> 00:10:44.060
And there's some 2 pis.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.870
And so this is what
would be meant by--

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.760
if you have two
momenta that are equal,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.460
you know that they're
in the same grid square.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.790
And then they have the same
little green arrow as well.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.700
That's what that's saying.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.240
So when we talked
about what happens

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.820
with the multipole
expansion in position space,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.200
we said that
effectively you have

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.730
a non-conservation of momenta.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.230
OK.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.470
We had a field at 0.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.992
We worked through
what that meant.

00:11:16.992 --> 00:11:18.700
And it meant, basically,
that the momenta

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.825
was conserved on the other
line, but not on the one

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:22.880
that you were doing
the expansion on.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.970
The nice thing about
this type of setup

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.190
is that we have
conservation of momenta,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.900
but we actually have two
conservations of momenta.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.687
So we don't give up
momentum conservation.

00:11:31.687 --> 00:11:33.520
It's just that we go
over to a picture where

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.240
we have two of them.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.840
So let me show you
how that works.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.110
Let's say we have an
ultra soft particle,

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.900
and it's hitting
a collinear quark.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.880
The collinear quark,
because it's collinear,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.770
carries two types of momentum.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.670
It carries a label
P and a residual.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.235
But the ultra soft guy,
it's only residual.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.275
So let's just call
that k residual.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.350
There's no label to
that ultra soft guy.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.490
So if I just look then what
this guy's momentum is,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.958
it's P label for the large
piece because that is not

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.250
affected by the ultra soft guy.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.025
And then it's P residual
plus k residual.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.740
OK, so we have a conservation
in the residual space,

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.750
which is the standard one.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.760
And we have a conservation
in the label space,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.580
but the ultra soft particles
just don't contribute to that.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.400
So we have two
conservation laws.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.867
And we just know that certain
fields can carry these label

00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:20.200
momentum and other fields can't.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:32.390
All right, well,
since Pr here and kr,

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.990
the residual components, is just
standard quantum field theory--

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.930
the only thing that's
special is the Pl.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.530
For the Pr, what we're going to
do for the residual momenta is

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.660
we're going to transform
back to position space.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.730
And that's kind of what we
do in HQET as well, right?

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.040
We treat this guy in momentum
space as a label and this guy

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.170
as a position space
for the residual.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.590
And the reason we really want to
do that is related to locality.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.545
And I'll say some
more words about that.

00:14:08.545 --> 00:14:09.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:09.750
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.917
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:13.800
IAIN STEWART: Sure.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.498
AUDIENCE: So this top equation--

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:16.290
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.400
AUDIENCE: So are you bounding
the d4Pr by lambda squared,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.760
or is there some reason why
the integral should fall off

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.330
before you get
there or something?

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.455
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, we're
going to talk about that.

00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:30.925
So, so far, this
is just notation.

00:14:30.925 --> 00:14:32.800
If you think about it
from this grid picture,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.483
you'd think some
hard walls put in.

00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:37.650
That's not quite the right
way of thinking about it.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.920
It's actually not right
for several reasons.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.870
And we will come back
and talk much more

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.390
about what the right way
of thinking about it is.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.447
But the physical picture
that you're in this box

00:14:47.447 --> 00:14:49.030
is the right way of
thinking about it.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.600
The tricky thing is that
these boxes are infinite.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.060
Each of these boxes is infinite.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.900
And we'll have to
see why that is.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.450
In what I've told
you so far, you'd

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.890
think that the d4Pr would really
be a box with some fixed edges.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.640
And it's going to turn
out that the d4Pr--

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.807
we're going to use dimensional
regularization-- it's

00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:07.147
going to be an infinite box.

00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:08.730
But we're still going
to be able to do

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.280
exactly what I'm telling you.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.893
And it's going to make sense.

00:15:12.893 --> 00:15:14.310
We're going to
want infinite boxes

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.640
to avoid breaking symmetries,
like gauge symmetry and Lorentz

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.420
symmetry.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.150
And we'll come back
and see how that works.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.603
So in some sense, what I've
told you is a Wilsonian story.

00:15:24.603 --> 00:15:26.520
And we're going to have
to make it into a more

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.890
continuum friendly story.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.440
But the moral of
the story, the way

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.630
you think about where
these momentum modes live,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.410
what kind of momentum they
carry, that is just true.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.910
So that part of the
story, which you

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.490
can think of so far
as Wilsonian, is true.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.190
And it's OK to think like that.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.680
So we'll see actually what we do
in practice a little later on.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.948
Where this will
really come in is

00:16:02.948 --> 00:16:04.990
when we start wanting to
think about doing loops,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:10.330
but we won't get there
for a little while yet.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.100
So the conservation
law in the residual

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.600
just corresponds to locality.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.970
We learned all about
locality yesterday

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.180
in [INAUDIBLE] seminar.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:41.680
And so we can make things
local by just going back

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:53.140
to the x base for
the residual momenta.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.900
OK, so we go back
to the x base, which

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.820
is the Fourier transform
conjugate variable

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.170
to the residual momenta.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.298
So the fields we're
actually going to use

00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:14.050
are these ones, where we
Fourier transform back

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:23.050
in the residual,
these guys here.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.550
So it's kind of
like HQET, where you

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.230
think about this part
as momentum space

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.960
and that part in position space.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.200
OK, so if you talk about
ultra soft interactions--

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.010
you can see it from over there--

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.060
they conserve the labels.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:56.710
So there's label
conservation of a field

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.510
for ultra soft interactions.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.430
The label of the
field here is the same

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.672
as the label of the field there,
so that ultra soft guys do not

00:18:03.672 --> 00:18:04.255
change labels.

00:18:08.992 --> 00:18:10.920
So this is Pl.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.770
This is Pl.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.090
And if this is ultra soft,
it's still labeled by Pl.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.110
And the thing that can change
is the residual momenta.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.030
And that's now
encoded in locality

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.600
in saying these fields all
sit at the same point x.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.320
On the other hand, the
collinear gluons cause us

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.790
to hop between boxes.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.710
So the collinear gluons
are label changing.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.830
And that's what's
different than HQET.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.110
In HQET, we don't
really have interactions

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.870
in the theory in the Lagrangian
that do that, but here we do.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.070
So if we have a
collinear gluon come in,

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.010
the collinear gluon,
again, carries both labels

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.980
and residuals if I
just draw the labels.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.190
And this is some Ql coming in.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.470
And this will be Pl plus Ql.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.960
And so the label of the
outgoing field has changed.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.390
There's one more label.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.200
And that's this n, right?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.440
We also label these
guys by a direction.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.937
And that is unchanged also by
the collinear interactions.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.380
So it's preserved by both
ultra soft and collinear

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.510
interactions.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.613
It can only be changed
by hard interactions

00:19:58.613 --> 00:20:00.530
where you would have
some hard production that

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.420
could produce, say, two guys
in two different directions.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.480
And those type of
interactions are typically

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.090
only going to occur once in
your quantum field theory,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.880
kind of like a decay, a weak
decay where it occurs once.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.010
And then you do perturbation
theory around that.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.690
Hard interactions
are that way, too.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.460
So as far as dynamics
is concerned,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.400
this label n is
something that you

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.590
can think of as being
conserved for the field.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.548
It's not going to be
changed by the Lagrangian,

00:20:23.548 --> 00:20:26.210
for example, all right?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.672
OK, so, now, we have
kind of what we want.

00:20:30.672 --> 00:20:32.130
And now, I want to
write the action

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.795
that we had before
in terms of this guy

00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:34.920
and see what it looks like.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.340
This split of these guys
into a Pl and Pr or Pl and x

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.560
allows us to expand
very easily in momenta.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.240
It's allowing us to do the
multipole expansion because we

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.490
have two things to talk about.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.700
And we just can compare them.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.170
So let's put the
pieces together.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:17.820
So Cn hat of x is the
full Fourier transform

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.120
of this Cn twiddle.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.520
And that can be split
for a collinear guy.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.025
We can split the measure,
and we can split the phase.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:43.320
And we can write the
field in this way.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.720
And then we decided that we
wanted to use this field.

00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:53.850
Let me see, [INAUDIBLE]
two pis here.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.170
So that means we take this
measure, we take this phase,

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.030
we take this guy, and we write
it back in terms of that field.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:12.270
So that leaves, if we
want to relate the field

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:18.450
that their Lagrangian was in
terms of in terms of this field

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:27.930
that I told you we're going to
use, it's this equation, OK?

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.822
All right-- a little
bit more formalism.

00:22:32.822 --> 00:22:35.280
So we're going to actually want
to have two different types

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.740
of derivatives, derivatives
that can talk to the momentum

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.825
conjugate to x and
derivatives that give this Pl.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.460
So we define two types
of derivative operators.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.910
One is just, if you like,
a standard derivative

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.970
in the x base of this guy,
acts only on that coordinate.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.550
And that derivative scales
like lambda squared.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.000
So that's residual, picking out
talking to residual momenta.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.450
Then we need something that
can give us the labels.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.920
So we define an
operator that does

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.380
that, which we'll call curly p.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.010
It doesn't care about x.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.820
And it's just defined
to give the Pl

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.810
mu of the field it acts on.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.670
So there's no plus
component to this.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.395
There's an order
1 minus component.

00:23:51.395 --> 00:23:52.645
And then perp is order lambda.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.010
I want to say how
big that guy is.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.065
So then we have a power counting
that tells us how big the p is

00:24:03.065 --> 00:24:04.190
and how big the partial is.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.540
And we can compare them, and
we can expand in them, OK?

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.910
So the bottom line
is that we now

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:24.070
can just say that, like we had a
comparison for the gauge field,

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.411
we have a comparison
for derivatives.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.420
And so this is exactly
analogous to what

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.600
we said before where we
had M bar dot A ultra soft

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.320
is much less than N bar dot
A collinear and A perp ultra

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.820
soft being much less
than A perp collinear.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.340
And in fact, the way
we're setting things up

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.890
is going to make the
gauge symmetry also easy.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.548
Because by gauge symmetry, these
derivatives and these fields

00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:02.340
should go together.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.580
They are the same size
in the power counting.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.610
And these guys should
go with those guys.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.732
So we're kind of doing this same
thing we thought of for fields

00:25:12.732 --> 00:25:13.940
we're doing for momenta here.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.710
So when we talk
about gauge symmetry,

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:32.360
this will make gauge
symmetry easier,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.237
this homogeneity between the
derivatives and the fields.

00:25:36.237 --> 00:25:38.320
So that's one of the powers
of thinking like this.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.032
OK, so let's see that
this notation is actually

00:25:52.032 --> 00:25:52.740
kind of friendly.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.010
So let me try to
convince you of that.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.070
It looks kind of daunting, but
maybe it's not so daunting.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:18.980
So let's look at this guy,
which was equal to this.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.860
So what I can do is I can
take this and replace it

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:34.500
by e to the minus i label
operator dot x, right?

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.140
But the label operator then
doesn't care about the sum.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.270
So I can push it through.

00:26:41.895 --> 00:26:45.290
So as an operator, it
goes through the sum.

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:54.760
I have that.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:06.650
And for a lot of purposes, in
a sense of suppressing indices,

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.420
we can just use a
simplified notation

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.100
for this guy where
we suppress the sum.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.500
So we were thinking about
this as a discrete sum.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.600
And we can always write out
that sum if we get confused.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.120
But we could also
adopt a notation

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.470
where we suppress the sum.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.467
And for many
manipulations, just like

00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:28.550
you might suppress some
indices in a quantum field

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.530
theory, that's perfectly fine.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.360
And having this label operator
makes it easy to do that.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.890
So if you have, for
example, field products,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:10.640
say I had two fermions, we
try to make the notation work

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.870
for us as nice as possible.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.980
Well, if you have
a sum of momenta

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.370
and then it's exponentiated,
if you have a product

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:20.830
and it's a product
of exponentials,

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:25.080
then it just becomes the
sum in the exponential.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.543
So this is true if we do
it for two fields, right?

00:28:30.543 --> 00:28:31.960
I'd have the label
operator acting

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.230
on this guy and that guy.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.760
And if I were to write out
this twice with two sums,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.913
then because the product
of those two exponentials

00:28:39.913 --> 00:28:42.330
can be just written as a single
exponential, this is true.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.700
So this guy acts on both fields.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.850
So in this sense, the
notation is friendly.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.297
And what this phase factor
here is really doing for you,

00:28:58.297 --> 00:29:00.130
if you think about it,
if you think about it

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.660
in a whole product
of fields, it's

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.540
just when you Fourier transform
giving the label conservation,

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.040
OK?

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.740
So there's going to be this
kind of overall e to the minus

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.000
i p dot x.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.170
And it's just sitting
there to conserve momentum

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.090
in the label space.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:42.980
So that's its purpose.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.260
OK, so there's one
more step that we

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.110
have to do before we start
talking about the Lagrangian.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.610
And that's this
little caveat that I

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.277
had right at the
beginning where I said,

00:29:51.277 --> 00:29:53.330
let's consider only quarks.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.490
So far, we've only considered
the quark part, not

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:56.420
the antiquark part.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.940
So let's see what we want
to do about antiquarks.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.520
Technically, the way that the
field theory wants to work

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.110
is that the quarks
and the antiquarks

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.420
kind of want to be
different fields,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.880
but that's very cumbersome.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.500
And so we're not
going to do that.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.785
And we're going to find, again,
sneaky notation to treat them

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:21.660
as one field even though
they want to be two.

00:30:25.852 --> 00:30:27.310
The reason that
they want to be two

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.868
is because, if you look at the
phase factor for the quarks

00:30:29.868 --> 00:30:32.410
in the antiquarks in the kind
of standard mode decomposition,

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.680
it has the opposite sign.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.080
So look at the mode
expansion in QCD.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:52.651
I can write it in a covariant
type notation or with a d4p p

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.990
if I put in the
proper projection.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:01.555
And then we have the quark
part with the e to the minus ip

00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:02.620
dot x.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.560
And then we have antiquark
part, our b daggers,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:18.370
and the e to the
plus ip dot x, OK?

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:22.660
So let me think of that as
a psi plus plus a psi minus.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.670
And we've so far only
talked about psi plus.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:36.960
So for psi plus of x,
we have a sum over Pl

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.200
not equal to 0 e to
the minus i Pl dot

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.745
x of sort of a Cn Pl plus of x.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.480
So this is the case we did.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.810
If we were to repeat everything
we did for this case, then what

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.970
we would get for psi minus--

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:01.740
and this is why I say that
they want to kind of look

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.780
like separate fields--

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.600
is we'd get a plus i Pl dot x.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.770
And in this notation, if
you think about the P0,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.890
the P0 is the sum of the
P minus and the P plus.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.260
So saying that, in this
mode decomposition,

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:31.920
P0 is greater than 0
for these two equations

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.735
and when we go over to sort
of a collinear scaling,

00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:37.090
it becomes that Pl
minus is greater than 0

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:37.960
in these equations.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.320
OK, so that's the sense in
which these are different.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.260
With a positive Pl minus, we
have an opposite phase factor

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.100
for these two guys.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.970
And in both of these
cases, it's true

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:57.250
that just as kind of a way of
remark, we still have this.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:02.620
That didn't change, remember.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.260
OK, but talking about minus
and plus fields would just

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.360
make our life really
difficult. Actually,

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.160
when we first derived SCET,
sometimes you're bone-headed.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.750
And we went through everything
in a much more detailed way

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.417
that I'm going to
present it to you now,

00:33:15.417 --> 00:33:17.680
wrote out everything in terms
of plus fields and minus

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.480
fields because of
this little issue.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.010
Then we noticed
the following thing

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.650
that I'm going to tell you, that
we could just put everything

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.560
back together with
a simple definition.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.050
And that's because really the
only difference is this sign.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.460
So if we want a kind
of convenient notation,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.160
we can do the following.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.480
So far, if you like, we
have this guy with Pl's

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.270
not equal to 0, but the Pl
minus should be greater than 0.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.590
So we can make use of
kind of negative labels

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.950
by the following trick.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:34:00.070
Just define a
composite field that

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.830
looks like this where I put
the minuses and the pluses

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.720
back together.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.740
If I have a positive
Pl minus here,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.990
then that's giving the pluses.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.550
If I have a negative
Pl minus here,

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.989
then that's giving
the minuses because

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:11.989
of what I just told you.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.389
We don't just think about this
guy as having plus Pl minus.

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:25.949
We allow it to have negative.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.780
And we take the
negative Pl minuses

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.659
as a way of encoding what's
going on with this guy.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.830
So we have different
possibilities for M bar dot Pl.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.590
And if you like, what
the plus guy is doing

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:51.489
is destroying particles.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:59.610
And so let's say
this is for the--

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.260
if I think about Cn of--

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.790
let me make my chart like this.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.940
If I think about what
Cn of Pl is doing,

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:10.560
it's destroying particles and
the antiparticles are created.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.950
But the antiparticles
are going to be

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.742
created for the
opposite sign of the Pl.

00:35:23.742 --> 00:35:25.950
And then if I think about
what the barred field would

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:29.720
be doing with this
notation, if the M

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.960
bar dot Pl is greater than 0,
then the particles are created.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.460
So this guy is
really just the field

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.870
we were talking about before
if Pl is greater than 0.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.630
And if Pl is less
than 0, it just

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.760
repeats the whole story
for the antiparticles.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.197
OK, so I could
write everything out

00:35:54.197 --> 00:35:55.780
in terms of this
plus and minus field.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.705
But if I just make
this simple definition,

00:35:58.705 --> 00:36:00.448
I could put everything
back together

00:36:00.448 --> 00:36:02.740
and just work in terms of
one field, which kind of does

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.970
what we're used to.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.240
And it's just a sign convention
to remember for this Pl.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.610
And that sign convention
is also easy to remember

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.060
because the Pl is really
following the fermion flow.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:19.630
If you think about
the fermion, then

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:24.220
if you think about the physical
momentum of that fermion,

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.380
then the physical momentum
follows the fermion

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.730
in the case of the fermion.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:32.650
And it's opposite to the fermion
in the case of the antifermion.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.155
So here's a fermion
coming into some vertex.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.850
There's a antiparticle
coming into the vertex.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.580
And the Pl goes this way.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.500
It follows the fermion flow,
whereas the physical momentum

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.310
is going this way.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.200
And that's the sign we're
just keeping track of.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.590
And so the P labels are
always following the arrows

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.150
of the fermion lines.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.180
They're always along the fermion
number with the conventions

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.100
we've set up.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.920
OK, so with that little
piece of notation,

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.130
we take into account the
antiparticles as well.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.960
There's no real
additional complications

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.005
since any way you
draw a picture it's

00:37:25.005 --> 00:37:26.630
completely clear
what's an antiparticle

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.765
and what's a particle.

00:37:27.765 --> 00:37:29.709
And it just follows
your intuition.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:42.470
And furthermore, because the
only difference in the mode

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.980
decomposition was that
sign and we've now

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.100
accounted for it by just
making the labels negative,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.240
we have this equation,
too, for both particles

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.685
and antiparticles.

00:37:57.415 --> 00:37:58.790
So we get the
opposite phase here

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.550
because this guy has
the opposite sign.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.137
So there's really no
additional complications

00:38:08.137 --> 00:38:10.595
from adding the antiparticles
once we set up this notation.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.570
OK, any questions so far?

00:38:27.018 --> 00:38:28.185
What about collinear gluons?

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:37.610
So the gluon field is
Hermitian, the original one.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.710
And what does that
translate into?

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.050
Well, it translates into
the B's and the A's, right?

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.660
They're both appearing in the
decomposition of the field.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.380
There's no B's.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.190
There are just A's.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.942
And if you work out, using
the type of body decomposition

00:38:52.942 --> 00:38:54.900
that we're doing and
using the type of notation

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.000
that we're doing,
what that means,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.500
it means that the star of
this guy just flips the sign.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.300
So that's what Hermiticity
of the original field

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.490
becomes for this notation.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:17.340
And again, because of
the theta functions

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.350
that show up in the
mode decomposition,

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.775
you can think of associating
ql minus greater than 0

00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:29.190
as sort of destruction and
then ql minus less than 0

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.020
as creation.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.750
If you want, although it's
not absolutely necessary,

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.150
you could adopt this convention.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.440
And then that would just be
putting a particular direction

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.065
to your gluons.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.010
And everything that we
said before goes through.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:54.270
And in particular, if
we think of decomposing

00:39:54.270 --> 00:40:01.500
sort of the hatted version
of the fields, then this--

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.265
just like before.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.690
And we can just also,
again as before,

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.140
if we like, adopt the notation
where we suppress the labels

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.400
if we don't need them.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.113
So the gluons really,
in some sense,

00:40:21.113 --> 00:40:22.530
it's just simpler
because we don't

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.480
have to worry about the
particles and the antiparticles

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.688
because of their Hermiticity.

00:40:25.688 --> 00:40:29.560
It's sort of they're
all the same thing.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.318
And for most purposes, there's
no sense in even keeping

00:40:32.318 --> 00:40:33.360
track of this convention.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:40.508
So that's why I went
through it quickly

00:40:40.508 --> 00:40:42.050
because the convention
is always kind

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.690
of obvious from the context.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.390
If you're really talking about
production of a real gluon

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.868
or annihilation of a
real gluon, then you

00:40:49.868 --> 00:40:51.410
can keep track of
the signs that way.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.809
The fermions are a
little different.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.347
So because any starred field is
just the negative of this guy,

00:41:04.347 --> 00:41:06.680
we could always write everything
in terms of fields that

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.730
have no daggers for the gluons.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.470
But for the fermions,
some of the fields

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.610
are barred or daggered.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:23.540
OK, so what would be the form
of having a general label

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.452
operator act on some
combination of daggered fields

00:41:26.452 --> 00:41:28.160
and some combination
of undaggered fields

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.445
where the gluons are
always undaggered?

00:41:31.445 --> 00:41:33.320
Well, it just gives the
sum of these momenta.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.530
And the way it does it-- so
sum of the label of momenta.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.986
So I'm thinking of all these
denominators as label momenta.

00:41:46.986 --> 00:41:50.780
I'll maybe not put the l.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.880
And the way that
the convention works

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.055
is that we get a minus
sign for the daggered guys.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.839
That's our sign convention.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.760
And the reason for that sign
convention is effectively that,

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.330
if you think about
e to the minus i

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:28.230
curly p dot x on sum
5 p1 and then you

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:35.265
take the dagger of that, then
it becomes 5 p1 dagger of e

00:42:35.265 --> 00:42:41.730
top the plus i kind
of p dagger dot x.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:44.130
And basically, I'm
saying that I want to be

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.340
able to write that like this.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.020
And that convention is useful.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.170
So if I want to act forward
on this field, which

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:59.628
is a daggered field,
then I'm going

00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:01.210
to take the opposite side.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:06.390
And if I have a daggered p, then
it would take the plus sign.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.100
And that convention
is the useful one

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:14.580
for keeping track of
momentum conservation

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.040
because then every field
has the same convention.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.040
We just have e to the minus i
p dot x for every single field.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:39.230
All right, so if we started
with some partial derivative--

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.390
I mean some regular derivative.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.420
And it was acting on one
of our hatted fields.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.585
So if I write it out in
terms of the labels--

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.790
put a Pl on it if you like--

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.570
we'd have that.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.820
And so there's two contributions
from this derivative.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.610
It either hits the phase
or it hits the field.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.220
And so we can write it like--

00:44:16.996 --> 00:44:20.630
if we go over to
the label operator,

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.790
we can write it that
this partial derivative

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:31.860
is the sum of two
derivatives, which then we

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.350
can take the sum over Pl
inside and write it as--

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:41.940
so every derivative for the
purposes of this exercise

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.140
is to convince you of the
sanity of the notation.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.780
Every regular derivative acting
on one of these hatted fields

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.760
where we hadn't yet
decomposed momenta

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.340
just becomes a sum of
these two derivatives.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.190
And that's just like the fact
that we split the full momentum

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.880
into the sum of the label
in the residual piece.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:12.240
OK, this is the field version
of P mu equals Pl mu plus P

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.010
residual mu.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.230
OK, but the advantage
of this notation

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:23.130
is that we can then drop the
partials if they're smaller.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.810
That's the whole
reason for this setup.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.080
So now, we can
expand because we've

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.280
split up both the
fields and the momentum.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.567
So we're able to expand.

00:45:38.567 --> 00:45:40.650
So let's go back to the
thing we wanted to expand.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.130
So we had this guy.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.870
And we wanted to expand it.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:00.550
And now, we know
how to expand it.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.370
We've set up a nice way of
doing the multipole expansion

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:07.940
by introducing some
additional notation.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:21.340
So because of what I just
said and because of what I

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:36.020
said last night for
the gauge field,

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.030
we have a very
simple decomposition

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.470
for the covariant derivative.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.240
It's the sum of a
collinear kind of piece

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.010
and an ultra soft kind of piece.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.860
So this P mu plus i
partial mu is just this.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.380
And the split of the gauge
field into these two pieces

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.120
is what we talked
about last time.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.662
And that split of
the gauge field

00:46:51.662 --> 00:46:53.870
actually led to some things
that we didn't talk about

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.953
that we'll talk about later.

00:46:55.953 --> 00:46:57.620
So if we now look at
the components that

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:01.400
are appearing in here,
we can figure out

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.602
what to keep in each case.

00:47:02.602 --> 00:47:03.560
And it's pretty simple.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:14.980
Well, for the plus,
there's nothing to drop.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.535
We just keep everything.

00:47:16.535 --> 00:47:18.410
And there's also only
one type of derivative,

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.365
so we just keep this.

00:47:20.365 --> 00:47:21.400
This is exact.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.790
All terms here are
order lambda squared.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:36.170
For the perp, we just
keep the collinear parts.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:44.560
So if I write out
the other part,

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.420
just for completeness
we can drop those terms

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.420
relative to these terms.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.870
Because these terms
here are lambda,

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.020
and these terms here are
order lambda squared.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:03.070
So we drop these guys from
the leading order and then,

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.300
similarly, for the minus.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.720
So here, this guy is
order lambda squared.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.480
And this guy is order lambda 0.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.400
So we drop this guy.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:44.900
OK.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.420
So now, just plug those
things into our Lagrangian.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.849
And then we get the
leading order Lagrangian.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.795
All of these phase factors can
be encoded in an overall phase

00:49:11.795 --> 00:49:12.295
factor.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.010
We get the full n
dot D derivative.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.620
But for the collinear
parts, we only

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.350
get these piece, this piece,
and the piece over there.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.100
And so you can think of that
as a collinear covariant

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.096
derivative.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:35.190
No.

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:48.930
So sort of in the
obvious notation,

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:54.480
we take the two pieces that
are collinear and put them

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:59.010
into a collinear D and likewise
in the n bar direction.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.370
OK, so this Lagrangian here is
the leading order Lagrangian

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:11.930
with this additional notation.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.130
And if you like, we
have this kind of D

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.850
that has both pieces in it
for that n dot direction.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:20.660
And then for the other two, we
just have the collinear pieces.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.010
And that's the
leading order action.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:26.630
Where we've carried out
the multipole expansion,

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.840
after we introduced notation,
it became something trivial.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.120
So the power of the notation is
that, once you've swallowed it,

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.695
everything else is simple.

00:50:34.695 --> 00:50:36.320
If I want to go to
higher order, I just

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.518
work out what these terms are.

00:50:38.518 --> 00:50:40.310
Then I should also
worry about these terms.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.435
And we'll do that later on.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.720
OK, so what can we
note about this?

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.260
Well, one thing that
we worked out earlier

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.070
was that this should
be of order lambda.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.485
And that actually implies
that, our new field,

00:51:00.485 --> 00:51:02.000
we were just pulling out phases.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.125
And that doesn't change
the overall power counting.

00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:06.770
So our new field is of
order lambda as well.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.060
And likewise, before
we sort of had a power

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.480
counting for the
measure, which you

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.300
can think of in our
new notation as a power

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.890
counting for this
thing, and that just

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:18.835
scales like lambda to
the minus 4 as before.

00:51:18.835 --> 00:51:20.210
So all the power
counting that we

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.390
were doing even before
we sort of figured out

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.640
what the right field to use,
that all carries through.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.140
And that's why I did it earlier.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.950
OK, so what's going on
here, which I didn't really

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.620
spell out, but I
can spell out now,

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.590
is since this phase is
order 1, the power counting

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.930
from momenta induces a
power counting on the x.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.450
And it's kind of the larger
momentum that dominates.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:52:01.530
So x minus scales like
1 over p plus x plus--

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.300
remember in the
dot product, it's

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.660
always plus times
minus, a confusing thing

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.690
about light cone coordinates.

00:52:12.537 --> 00:52:14.370
And so if you count up
the powers of lambda,

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.200
you get minus 4 of
them because you

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:21.750
get 2 here, none here,
and then 2 there.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:24.250
So that's all going
through as before.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:27.750
And then if you ask, what's
the order of the Lagrangian,

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.570
the Lagrangian density here
is order lambda to the 4.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.040
Because we have two
fields, and then

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.730
we have a lambda squared
here and then a lambda here,

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:58.890
a lambda 0 here,
and a lambda there.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.640
And our power counting
made that explicit.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.830
So the whole thing
is lambda to the 4.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:04.720
This lambda to the 4
of the Lagrange density

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.630
cancels the lambda to the
minus 4 of the measure.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:16.680
And you get that,
when you integrate,

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.760
this is lambda to the 0.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.740
And that's what we wanted.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.880
That was our convention for
the leading order term, OK?

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.980
So the power counting,
nothing really changes.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.850
We had a power
counting for momenta.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.730
We just now have a power
counting for all these objects

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:30.772
that we're talking about.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.670
What about locality?

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.160
Well, all the fields in
this Lagrangian are at x.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.590
So it is local in
residual momenta.

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:51.362
We said that already when we
were drawing Feynman diagrams.

00:53:51.362 --> 00:53:52.820
And that's just
true of the action.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:18.370
And so what that
means is the action

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:23.810
is local at the smallest
momentum scale in our problem.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.020
And we would have been
surprised if we'd encountered

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.228
anything different than that.

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.225
The action is actually also
local at the scale lambda.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.230
Even though we adopted
this label convention just

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:52.400
to separate the momenta, there's
no inverse perp derivatives

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.383
in this action.

00:54:54.383 --> 00:54:56.550
And so the perp derivatives
appear in the numerator.

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.790
And so it's actually
local at that scale, too.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.620
And so if you like
this, we've just

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.552
written something that's
in momentum space.

00:55:08.552 --> 00:55:10.010
And it's the momentum
space version

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:11.585
of locality at the scale lambda.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.700
And we've hidden all
the momentum space

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.640
so it even looks local.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.562
But if we were to write
out the indices again,

00:55:24.562 --> 00:55:26.270
we would see that it's
the momentum space

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.620
version of locality.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.540
And so the only scale
that it's non-local at

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.540
is actually scale that
we want to integrate out,

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:33.290
the hard scale.

00:55:44.037 --> 00:55:46.370
And that's due to sort of the
presence of this kind of 1

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:48.950
over M bar dot Pl type factor.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.450
So that we already
sort of saw earlier

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:57.820
when we were talking about
building up the Wilson line,

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.120
right?

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.650
We said, well, there's
some off-shell fields.

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.030
Let's start
integrating them out.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:03.518
And we got inverse powers
of this M bar dot Pl,

00:56:03.518 --> 00:56:04.810
but that was at the hard scale.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:07.660
So we had no choice but
to integrate them out.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.775
And you can think
about this factor here.

00:56:10.775 --> 00:56:13.150
If it bothers you, you can
think about it in the same way

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.870
that it's not any worse
than what we already did.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:24.760
OK, let's see if this
Lagrangian does what we want.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.980
Let's look at propagators.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:37.200
If we have a collinear
propagator with a collinear

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.060
gluon, say, coming in,
let's look at this diagram.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.420
These are fields
in the n direction.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.800
This is some guy that's Pl Pr.

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.626
And let me just take it to
be Pr plus for convenience.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.100
Then if you look
at this guy and you

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:09.212
ask what that propagator
is, it comes out exactly how

00:57:09.212 --> 00:57:10.170
we want it to come out.

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.120
So there's nothing
that gets dropped

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:27.430
in the denominator in
particular in the sense

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:31.928
that all components of the
momentum are showing up.

00:57:31.928 --> 00:57:33.220
We're still dropping residuals.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.952
But if we're just talking
about collinear particles,

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.660
then the residuals
are kind of redundant.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.460
The purpose of the
residual's momenta

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.530
is when we're talking
about both collinear

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:44.930
and ultra soft particles.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.520
So the other case
that we need to treat

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.817
is when we have an
ultra soft particle.

00:57:49.817 --> 00:57:52.150
We could, of course, have
both of them at the same time,

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:54.166
but let's treat this case.

00:57:54.166 --> 00:58:02.240
So we have Pl, Pl plus some
k, which is purely residual.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.780
And now, this guy, because
of the derivatives,

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:08.140
these derivatives
don't see the k.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.052
None of these
derivatives see the k.

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.500
So in the n bar in the
perp, we don't see the k.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.952
It would look like that.

00:58:29.952 --> 00:58:32.160
If you like, if you want to
make it kind of look more

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.743
like the Lagrangian,
convince yourself

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:37.170
that this is the inverse,
just divide by this factor.

00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:40.057
Divide by this factor,
then it puts it under here.

00:58:40.057 --> 00:58:41.890
And that's exactly what
this is doing if you

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.830
ignore the Dirac structure.

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:50.400
It's not playing a role
really for the propagator.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.650
And same here, if you take
this factor, divide it out,

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:56.310
then you got the plus piece
which is this derivative.

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:59.440
And then you get perp
squared over minus.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.390
And that's what happens if
you put this down stairs, OK?

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:05.670
For linear, all the
components show up

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.530
because we didn't drop anything.

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:11.210
For ultra soft, only
the plus shows up

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:13.720
because it only changes the
plus momentum of the collinear

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.200
field.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.820
So the Lagrangian is smart.

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.237
It knows how to
deal with the fact

00:59:20.237 --> 00:59:22.445
that the propagator should
be different for these two

00:59:22.445 --> 00:59:23.010
situations.

00:59:27.743 --> 00:59:29.660
And that was one of the
things that we wanted,

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.790
and we achieved it.

00:59:33.248 --> 00:59:34.790
So even though the
Lagrangian doesn't

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:36.190
know what's going
to happen, it's

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:38.420
smart enough to deal with
any possible thing that

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.485
could happen and give
the right propagator.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.370
So we don't have to
expand any further.

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.940
The Lagrangian knows how to give
the leading order propagator

00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.890
for any situation that
we might be interested

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:04.390
in at leading order, which
are these two situations.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:13.150
What about Feynman
rules for interactions?

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.330
So that's also interesting.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:28.800
So if we have an
ultra soft gluon,

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.290
and let's say it
has an index mu,

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:38.730
there's only one
term that comes in

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:42.240
because it's only the n dot D
that had an ultra soft field.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.030
All the other ultra
soft fields got dropped.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.420
So there's only n dot A
ultra soft in the Lcc0.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.530
And so there's only one term.

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.480
Things are a little more
complicated for the collinear.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.022
And this is kind of
the price that we

01:01:03.022 --> 01:01:08.590
pay for setting up the notation
that we did the way we did.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:12.070
So this guy here has all terms.

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:27.625
Just by pulling a gluon field
out of any one of the terms

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:30.970
it can couple to any
component of the gluon field

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:32.972
just like in QCD,
but our Feynman rule

01:01:32.972 --> 01:01:34.930
is a little more complicated
because of the way

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.250
we set things up.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.410
And in some ways,
what's happened

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:41.680
is that we've made
the propagator simpler

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.050
for the collinear fields at
the expense of complicating

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:45.226
the interaction.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.570
OK, so we couple
to all components--

01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:59.280
the perp component,
the n component,

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.228
and the n bar component if
this is a collinear field.

01:02:04.228 --> 01:02:05.645
So these are all
collinear fields.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.250
So one way of thinking about
why that kind of had to happen

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.660
is the following.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.320
What if we didn't
have ultra softs?

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.487
Imagine that we were going
through this whole story,

01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:21.150
but we just had collinears.

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.040
Then you wouldn't
really need to go

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.582
through this multipole expansion
because there would never be

01:02:25.582 --> 01:02:26.880
two momentum of different size.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.580
And you could actually, just
for the collinears, use QCD.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.740
The purpose of having
this multipole expansion

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.240
is really because we want to
talk about both of these things

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:34.948
at the same time.

01:02:34.948 --> 01:02:36.448
In fact, if you
only had collinears,

01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:38.460
you just boost to the
frame where they're not

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.620
having this boosted scaling.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.930
It's really relative scalings
that the effective theory

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.660
is trying to encode, relative
scaling between collinear

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.770
and ultra soft or between,
say, two collinears going off

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:50.727
back to back.

01:02:50.727 --> 01:02:52.810
That's where the power of
the effective theory is,

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:53.730
in relative thing.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.980
So it's only when you have
two things at the same time

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.668
and you want to
describe both of them

01:02:57.668 --> 01:02:59.460
that you get into the
kind of complications

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.293
we're talking about.

01:03:00.293 --> 01:03:03.810
If you just have one thing,
then things are simple.

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:05.850
You could just use QCD.

01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.220
But if you just had QCD
for the collinear sector,

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:12.260
you'd know that you have a very
simple Feynman rule, igTA gamma

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.090
mu, and a more
complicated propagator

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.588
because you'd have a P slash.

01:03:17.588 --> 01:03:19.130
Well, here we don't
have any P slash.

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:23.220
The propagator, if you
write out the spin,

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.710
is simply n slash over 2.

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:27.570
But the P slash has to
come back somewhere.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.250
And it's coming
back because it gets

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.140
encoded in the way we set
things up in this vertex.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.710
So these factors of P slash here
are just reproducing P slashes.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.930
Then in the full QCD context,
it would be in the propagator.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.640
You can actually
work out, if you

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.640
start writing down Feynman
diagrams, that that's

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.032
exactly what's going on, OK?

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:47.490
So that's kind of
the price that we

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.335
paid for sort of making
a Lagrangian that

01:03:50.335 --> 01:03:51.960
dealt with both things
at the same time

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.700
and made this part
really simple.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.747
That part became slightly
more complicated.

01:03:55.747 --> 01:03:57.330
But once we know
what I just told you,

01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:00.330
we can oftentimes, you know,
carry out calculations here

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:04.260
by making correspondences
with the full QCD Lagrangian.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.675
Sometimes that's done anyway.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.900
They couple to all four
components of the field.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.640
Actually, once
you start learning

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.583
how to deal with
numerators like this,

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:23.250
it's different than
what you're used to,

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.740
but it's just, in some
sense, as complicated

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.833
using this Lagrangian.

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:28.500
It's just that you're
writing things out

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.740
in components, which you
might not want to do, right?

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.110
Why decompose things
into components,

01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:35.220
which we're doing here?

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.130
Why do that if you don't
have sort of something that's

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.110
projecting onto a component?

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.440
That's, in some sense,
the only complication.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.010
OK.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:47.170
And there's one other
thing, of course,

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:51.340
which is that the Lagrangian
also had terms like this.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.510
So it's not simply just
one gluon interaction.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:57.642
We could have, for example,
two covariant derivatives,

01:04:57.642 --> 01:04:59.850
two of these perp covariant
derivatives, for example.

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:05.610
And there's a Feynman
rule for that, too,

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:09.370
which comes out of the
action that we wrote down.

01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:12.240
OK, questions?

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.248
AUDIENCE: So I
guess this, I mean,

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.788
the effective theory is
reproducing the collinear

01:05:20.788 --> 01:05:22.220
[INAUDIBLE] divergences of QCD?

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.700
IAIN STEWART: It is, yeah.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.570
AUDIENCE: So in [INAUDIBLE]
QCD, the higher divergence

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:30.540
cancel with interference
[INAUDIBLE]??

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.460
IAIN STEWART: And
that'll happen here, too.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.950
AUDIENCE: And you have to loops?

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:36.117
Or it's happening like a
leading order [INAUDIBLE]??

01:05:36.117 --> 01:05:38.158
IAIN STEWART: No, you have
to look at loops, too.

01:05:38.158 --> 01:05:39.870
So, yeah, there can
be cancellations

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:41.820
between real and virtual graphs.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.070
And there actually can
be such cancellations

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:46.680
separately for ultra soft
gluons and for collinear gluons.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.930
So we'll talk about what
you're talking about a little

01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.440
later on.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.770
But there is an important
point that I'll emphasize

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:54.180
since you ask the question.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.310
If you ask about
the divergences,

01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:00.240
the infrared divergences
of an ultra soft gluon, so

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.790
the ultra soft gluon, if we go
back to sort of where it was

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:05.770
living, it was littered here.

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:08.440
Collinear gluon was living here.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.410
And if you ask
about divergences,

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:11.910
what the divergences
are coming from

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:15.390
are momenta going to 0 or
momentum going collinear.

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:18.240
And this guy here that
lives kind of here

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.980
can go both collinear,
and it can go soft.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.320
So the names collinear
and soft, which

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.200
correspond to the names
collinear and soft divergences,

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.610
are not a one-to-one
correspondence.

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.800
An ultra soft
particle can actually

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.940
have both collinear
and soft divergences.

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.770
The collinear particle
can also actually

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:43.500
have both types of divergences.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.450
And so the names are
associated to where

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:48.030
they live in momentum space,
not the type of divergences

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:49.140
that they're encoding.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.630
If I wanted to do something
along the lines of setting up

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:55.685
the field theory to just exactly
correspond to the divergences,

01:06:55.685 --> 01:06:57.060
well, first of
all, no one's ever

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.750
figured out how to do that.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.292
But you could imagine
how it would be

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:01.542
different than what I'm doing.

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:03.420
Because if I wanted to
do that, then somehow

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.570
my collinear field would sort of
be sort of sensitive to angles.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.580
It should be like
an angular variable

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:11.940
because the divergences are
coming from angles going to 0.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.630
And it's not an
angular variable.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:15.402
It's just a regular field.

01:07:15.402 --> 01:07:16.860
So setting things
up in this way is

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.590
kind of how we usually think
of an effective field theory.

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:22.140
We're just talking about
momenta small or big.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.870
And that's what we're doing,
but it comes in the sense

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.720
that you don't have a
direct correspondence

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.520
with the divergences.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.213
AUDIENCE: So you have more
divergences [INAUDIBLE]??

01:07:35.213 --> 01:07:36.630
IAIN STEWART: The
way of saying it

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:41.010
is that you have more
divergences in a way,

01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:43.460
but they're the
same divergences--

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.760
yeah.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.960
Yeah.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.480
So you don't have
more divergences,

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.020
but really what's happening is--

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:56.220
so if you look at
this kind of picture,

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.200
if you look at the kind
of infrared divergences

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.740
that you could have,
so let's regulate them

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.660
with an off-shellness.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.160
You could have
infrared divergences

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.530
that would be like that.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:10.830
But when you do some
diagrams, there's

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:16.620
kind of infrared divergences
that could look like this, OK?

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.350
I'm just telling you something
that you have to trust me.

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:22.140
And this is coming from
an ultra soft scale.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.380
P squared over P minus,
that's this hyperbola.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.720
That's the scale
of this hyperbola.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.630
And the P squared here is
the scale of this hyperbola.

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:33.540
What the effective theory does
is, any ultra soft diagram,

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.819
that'll give all these logs.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:40.560
Any collinear diagram
will give all these logs.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.930
You could say, well, P
minus is a hard scale.

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:46.696
So really the only the IR
divergences are just P squared,

01:08:46.696 --> 01:08:48.779
but the effective theory
is kind of dividing it up

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:50.069
into these two types of logs.

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:51.986
And that's actually going
to be useful for us.

01:08:51.986 --> 01:08:53.700
We'll see that that
allows us to do

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.325
some things that are
not so obvious how

01:08:55.325 --> 01:08:56.399
to do in the full theory.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:04.154
So, yes, it is kind of splitting
and IR divergence in these two

01:09:04.154 --> 01:09:06.279
different types of terms,
but that's actually going

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:08.080
to be something that's useful.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.390
Because in some sense,
there's two physical scales

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:11.109
in the infrared.

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:12.981
There's a sort of
collinear hyperbola

01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:14.189
and the ultra soft hyperbola.

01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:16.231
And the effective theory
is making that explicit.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.130
Other questions?

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.840
All questions have
been good so far.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.302
Keep asking them.

01:09:26.302 --> 01:09:30.100
AUDIENCE: Could you try
using two different lambdas

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.998
for the ultra soft
and the collinear?

01:09:32.998 --> 01:09:33.790
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:40.210
So you could if there
was a physical reason why

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.000
you wanted to.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.439
And the thing is that, if
the lambdas order each other,

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:49.569
then there's no point.

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:51.910
If there's a hierarchy,
then what that would change

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:56.530
would be that the n dot D
should get expanded, too.

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:58.412
But if the n dot
D gets expanded,

01:09:58.412 --> 01:10:00.370
then kind of what is
happening is you're really

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:02.264
decoupling everything.

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:03.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:04.022
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:10:04.022 --> 01:10:06.970
And so you're kind of losing
the dynamical connection that we

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.170
have so far in this theory.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.210
So I think it's
not so interesting,

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:12.600
but it's worth thinking about.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.870
OK.

01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:15.130
We're going to erase this.

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:25.210
OK.

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:27.400
So now, that we have a
leading order Lagrangian,

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.730
it does everything
that we want it to do.

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:31.720
We can use it to calculate
Feynman diagrams.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.360
It defines the leading
order collinear

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.460
sector in the effective theory.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.380
There's one more
thing I want to do.

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.490
And that's come back to the
fact that I told you before,

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:47.860
but now that we can
actually make more explicit.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.312
And that fact was, when we
were talking about currents

01:10:51.312 --> 01:10:53.020
and integrating that
off-shell particles,

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.768
we saw that you start
with these guys.

01:10:54.768 --> 01:10:55.810
You start attaching them.

01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:57.430
And you end up
with a Wilson line.

01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:01.870
I'd now like to make it obvious
that that kind of manipulation

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.630
always is true, that we can
always get rid of this field

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:07.750
and put it in terms
of a Wilson line.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.990
And the notations
that we've introduced

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:14.680
are going to allow
us to do that.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:20.320
So let's have a little
aside on that fact.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.410
So if you are in momentum
space, the Wilson line

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:32.281
has an equation of motion, or a
defining equation if you like,

01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:33.660
that's this.

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.470
This defines the direction,
that the Wilson line is

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:40.120
long n bar dot n bar direction.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.760
And the x and the minus
infinity are telling you

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.830
what the end points are.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:47.680
So this is the
defining equation.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.330
You can look back
at Peskin if you

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:53.430
want to see how that all works.

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:55.555
And that's the defining
equation in position space.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.620
But we've just advocated
for a kind of momentum space

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.920
notation.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.140
So what's the corresponding
equation to momentum space?

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.740
It's pretty simple.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.700
If we go over to our
momentum space Wilson line,

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.220
we just go over to our momentum
space covariant derivative.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.780
And the defining
equation is this.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.170
So the notation, in some
sense, is pretty simple.

01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:29.620
We just have to switch objects.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:37.500
If we write out what
that derivative is,

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:44.430
then it's that, OK?

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.920
So now, consider
the following thing.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.770
Consider this
combination, but let

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:53.170
me think about it as
an operator equation.

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:55.680
So let me think about
it as if there could

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.168
be something to the right.

01:12:58.168 --> 01:13:00.210
If there's something to
the right, than the P bar

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.910
can act on that thing, too.

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:05.830
So I get 0 if the P
bar acts on this thing.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:08.100
But if the P bar
acts through, then I

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.050
get just P bar on the operator.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:16.090
So as an operator
equation, I can

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:28.860
trace the O. This
is true for any O.

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.630
And we have this
operator equation.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:45.370
But I know something else I
know that the Wilson line is

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:47.440
at e to the i something.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.390
And actually, it's unitary.

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:54.580
So W dagger W is 1.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.450
And again, in momentum
space notation,

01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:05.440
that's kind of
the obvious thing.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.860
W dagger W is 1.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.020
And that means I can
multiply this equation here

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:13.830
on the left or the
right by W daggers.

01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:23.310
And so if I do that, let
me multiply it by W dagger.

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:33.000
And I can write i n bar dot
Dn is Wn P bar Wn dagger.

01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:44.340
So the gauge field, g n bar dot
An, because of gauge symmetry,

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.400
it's always going to show up
in the covariant derivative.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.010
So it's always going to
show up in this combination.

01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:51.390
And this equation
is telling me I

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:56.850
can switch that for Wilson lines
in this P bar if I want to.

01:14:56.850 --> 01:14:59.910
I could have also multiplied
things the other way around

01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:02.640
and written it P bar.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.263
So sort of by way
of completeness,

01:15:06.263 --> 01:15:07.680
I could have written
that as well.

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:30.650
It's also easy to convince
yourself of the following.

01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:41.930
1 over P bar is Wn dagger
1 over i n bar dot D W.

01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:44.540
And 1 over i n bar dot D--

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.830
I'll check that I got the
daggers in the right place.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:55.360
But these two equations
are true, kind

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.290
of the inverse of
those equations.

01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:58.340
So how do we check that?

01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.840
Well, just multiply
this times this.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.230
You should get 1, right?

01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:04.880
And if I multiply,
say, on the right here,

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.450
then the W dagger here
kills the W dagger.

01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:08.800
Then the P bar kills the P bar.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.270
And then the W
kills the W dagger.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.190
So those are true.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.860
And so we can put this into
the Lagrangian if we want.

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.790
And we can do what I said,
that we can actually,

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:36.740
if we want to, get
rid of the n bar

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:45.970
dot A field for the collinears
in terms of Wilson lines.

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:52.690
And we'll use this from time
to time when it's convenient.

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:57.410
If we use the D Lagrangian, the
Lagrangian becomes this thing.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:07.190
So that 1 over i n bar
dot D becomes this thing.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.680
And in some sense,
you might think

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.450
that this is easier
to expand if you

01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:12.170
know the expansion
of the Wilson line.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:16.480
And we just have to
let a 1 over P bar act

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.180
on this full
combination of fields.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.460
And it just gives
the total n bar

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.270
dot P momentum of that
full combination of fields.

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:28.610
I claimed this was true.

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.730
And now, I show you in a
kind of non-trivial case

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.980
how, with these
operator manipulations,

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.290
we could just quickly
go back and forth.

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:36.790
And it's related
to the fact that it

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:40.000
appears in this combination.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.010
We'll talk more about
gauge symmetry later on.

01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:43.552
I'm alluding to it
from time to time,

01:17:43.552 --> 01:17:46.180
but we'll talk about it
more precisely later on.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:57.390
We have to do this story for
the collinear gluon Lagrangian.

01:17:57.390 --> 01:18:01.980
And much of this
is just repeating

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.190
what we've said for the
quarks for the gluons.

01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:08.640
And once we know how to write
down the covariant derivatives,

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.540
then it's actually
not so complicated.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.220
And there's just one
little complication

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.510
that we should be
careful about, which

01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:19.960
I want to emphasize to you.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.320
And so we'll go through it.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.025
Let me write the Lagrangian
in QCD in terms of traces.

01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:34.740
And let me use a
general covariant gauge.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.750
So this is a general
covariant gauge fixing term.

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:46.620
That should be called
the gauge parameter tau.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:50.460
Then we have some
ghost fields as well.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:57.180
And of course, g mu nu is
the usual g mu nu A TA.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:02.160
And that's my sign convention
commutator of two derivatives

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.760
with the pi over g.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.310
So we do the same
steps to get SCET.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.340
And so really, if you
think about writing

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.133
all the g's in terms
of D's, we already

01:19:16.133 --> 01:19:17.550
know how to split
the D's in terms

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:19.680
of ultra soft and
collinear parts.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.820
And so that's what we do.

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:32.880
Let me write out a D, which
is kind of a leading order D.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.633
And we'll just set
up some notation.

01:19:35.633 --> 01:19:37.800
And then I can just basically
write down the answer.

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:47.670
So let's set up a curly D that
has all the sort of pieces that

01:19:47.670 --> 01:19:49.110
will survive at leading order.

01:19:59.405 --> 01:20:01.780
So all the pieces that survived
were the collinear pieces

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.705
and perp in n bar and then, in
the n direction, both pieces.

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:10.030
And effectively, I'm just
changing all the regular Roman

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:13.420
D's in my gluon action
into these curly D's.

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:16.240
And that's almost
the entire story.

01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:38.410
So from a kind of power
counting perspective, once

01:20:38.410 --> 01:20:41.020
you take into account
that, when you dot things,

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.800
n's are always dotting
with the n bars,

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.930
so it's this times this.

01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:45.160
So this is lambda squared.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.310
This is order lambda 0.

01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:49.143
This guy dots into himself.

01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:50.810
So you get lambda
squared there as well.

01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:54.130
So for power counting purposes,
when you start squaring things,

01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:56.630
they're all going to be
homogeneous with this setup.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.470
So basically, that's
what I'm saying here.

01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:06.790
And then there's
one complication,

01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:08.597
and that's this
partial derivative.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:10.180
Well, there's two
partial derivatives.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.690
There's one there,
and there's one there.

01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:15.190
So this is in the
gauge fixing term.

01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:18.790
These terms are both
related to the gauge fixing.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:28.780
And then those terms, actually,
I want to make them covariant.

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:31.270
So let me define one more thing.

01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:32.770
I want to make them
covariant, but I

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:36.597
want to make them only covariant
under the ultra soft part

01:21:36.597 --> 01:21:37.180
of the action.

01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:46.518
So here is just
pulling out the pieces

01:21:46.518 --> 01:21:48.310
that would have the
ultra soft field making

01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:52.930
a derivative that I'll
call curly D ultra soft.

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:55.300
So one way of
thinking about that

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.640
is that it would be like
background field gauge.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.610
In background field gauge,
you'd make this partial view

01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:03.910
into the D mu of the background
involving the background field.

01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:05.860
And that would be a
background field gauge.

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.720
So from the point of view
of the ultra soft field

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.880
being a background
field, it's very natural

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.870
to have a replacement
that looks like this.

01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:19.720
And that's one way of arguing.

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.910
Really what's going on
in the effective theory

01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:26.020
is that this is general
covariant gauge for A n.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.620
That's what we want
it to be for A n mu.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.257
This should be the gauge fixing
term for the collinear gluons.

01:22:33.257 --> 01:22:34.840
And it shouldn't be
breaking any gauge

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.700
symmetry of ultra soft gluons.

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.590
So we'd actually
like the Lagrangian

01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:41.110
to both have gauge symmetry
for collinear gluons

01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:43.705
and a separate gauge symmetry
for the ultra soft gluons.

01:22:43.705 --> 01:22:46.330
Since this guy is supposed to be
gauge fixing for the collinear

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:48.205
gluons, we don't want
it to be doing anything

01:22:48.205 --> 01:22:49.810
to the ultra soft gluons.

01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:52.720
And that's accomplished if
we make this replacement

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.250
that i partial goes to
i curly D, all right?

01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:01.540
So we could write
out what Lcg0 is,

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:05.460
but it's just these
two replacements.

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:15.880
Since we're out of
time, I'll just say that

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.820
and, you know, sort of write
out the fields and the notation

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.450
that we developed, OK?

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:26.412
So we'll talk more next time.

01:23:26.412 --> 01:23:28.950
What we'll do next time is
we'll talk about symmetries.

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:30.790
We'll finally talk
about gauge symmetry.

01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:32.430
And we'll talk about
other symmetries.

01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:33.805
And in particular,
symmetries are

01:23:33.805 --> 01:23:36.120
going to be important
for understanding

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:39.270
how much of this story that I've
told you really carries through

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:40.830
once you start doing loops.

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:44.190
Symmetries protect you from
certain loop corrections.

01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:46.050
Gauge symmetry, for
example, connects terms

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:47.592
to all orders in
perturbation theory.

01:23:47.592 --> 01:23:51.750
And we'll see how those
things kind of work next time.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:55.200
Really, the story I've told
you so far is all tree level.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.090
We haven't done any loops.

01:23:57.090 --> 01:23:59.190
One way of handling
what loops can do

01:23:59.190 --> 01:24:01.140
is by looking at
symmetries and saying,

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.772
once we impose those
symmetries, what's

01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:04.980
the most general possible
things that loops could do.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.250
And we'll do that next time.

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:23.720
PROFESSOR: Recap last night
and give you-- remember

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.010
what we had for an overview.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.640
The first part was that it's
not about the business plan,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.040
it's about planning.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.960
That was the first
point I hope you got.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.540
The second one is that planning
is not a static process.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.010
It's dynamic.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.520
And therefore, your plan
is going to be dynamic.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.180
However you write it
down, or put it in slides.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.870
That's the first set of points.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.240
The second is the
three Ys-- or sorry,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.000
the second is your goals and
tasks in this whole process.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630
It's to create value.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.400
And the second goal is to
harvest some of the value.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.800
And as we pointed out,
those are easy to say

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.160
and it's increasingly
hard to do.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.910
The rest of the course
will be telling you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.820
try to how to do those things.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.150
The questions that investors
are going to be asking

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.190
are the 3 Whys.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.860
Why this?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.380
Why is this something important?

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.400
Why now?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.920
Why is now the
right time to do it?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.190
And why this team?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.895
Why is this group of
people the right people?

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:34.770
And if they get through
those, the fourth one

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.610
is why won't it work?

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.400
Now, I said that that's
what investors ask,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.620
and that's probably what
you ought to be asking.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.800
Because the final point is,
the most scarce resource is not

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.240
money, it's your time.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.050
So if you're not happy
with those answers

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.880
to those questions,
then you ought

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.980
to iterate and find some new
questions-- a new approach

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.480
to those.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.330
In fact, tonight our
speaker Bob is probably

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.040
going to talk about how you've
iterated [INAUDIBLE] things

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.980
on that score.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.670
OK, so tonight
we're starting down

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.039
the path of filling
in the business plan.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.160
The first thing we said if
you've got to create value.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.970
And one of the ways
you can create value

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.980
is to find a customer.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.920
And Bob Jones, who's one of
our highly paid volunteers,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.990
once again tripling your income.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.554
Bob is-- was a classmate
of mine at Sloan.

00:02:26.554 --> 00:02:27.970
People in the
audience from Sloan,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.530
do you know about
the C-function?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.230
Still going on?

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.940
You like that?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.510
That's Bob.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.790
He's the guy that organized
the first C-function.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.360
In addition to being a serial
entrepreneur-- for those of you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.650
who are not from the
Sloan side of campus,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.410
the C-Function is consumption
function in economics.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.130
And you can picture what might
be consumed at a Friday night

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.390
consumption function.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.110
So we'll leave it with that.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.480
Bob's a serial
entrepreneur, still at it.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.900
Like a lot of the speakers
that we're going to hear from,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.550
they're actually
doing the very things

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.150
they're talking to you about.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.690
So this isn't just an
academic exercise for them.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.680
Bob's other claim to fame is he
plays pretty good blues guitar

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.190
and he has a blues band.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.710
But I'll let him
decide whether he

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.090
wants to say anything
more about that.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.620
And with that, Bob, the
clicker is yours, sir.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.330
BOB JONES: Thanks, Joe.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.212
So good evening, everybody.

00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:32.090
I'd like to congratulate you
on the good sense required

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.570
to sign up for one
of the best courses

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.170
that the Institute offers.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.090
It's not the first
course here you'll

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.410
take here that has you
drinking from a fire hose.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.360
But this one's pretty
valuable stuff.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.450
How many of you are
in this because you're

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.115
thinking of competing
in the 100K competition?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.310
Good.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.390
How many of you
are contemplating

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.500
making your living
in entrepreneurship

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.130
when you get out of here?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.480
Oh dear, you poor things.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.540
How many of you actually have
something going right now?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.700
Wow.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.339
Well there's therapy available
for you guys, and medication.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.120
This is a little bit
like chronic illness,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.410
you might be able to
tamp it down for a while

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.374
and then it'll pop up again.

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:26.790
You won't be able
to get rid of it

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.750
once you're infected
and afflicted.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.950
I'd love some sense of what
you guys are working on,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.520
just some sense of the spectrum
of who's doing what here.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.700
Do you have a dog
walking service

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.020
for two-income
families, or do you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.950
have something that detects
the need for insulin

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.396
in a patient with diabetes?

00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:49.020
So somebody raise
your hand and give me

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.380
some sense of what it is
you're working on, please.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.880
Yes, sir.

00:04:53.832 --> 00:04:56.886
AUDIENCE: Business systems
for small- and medium-sized

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:58.385
BOB JONES: I'm
sorry, business what?

00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:00.260
AUDIENCE: Business
systems, IT systems,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.990
for small- and medium-sized
businesses [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.590
BOB JONES: OK.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.828
What's broke that you fix?

00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:13.812
AUDIENCE: They don't have
large enough IT organizations.

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:16.800
They can't afford to have
[INAUDIBLE] like more

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.292
large organizations do.

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:18.792
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.475
BOB JONES: All right so you're
sort of an outsourcing service.

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:27.650
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.471
BOB JONES: Rent an expert.

00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:30.970
Good.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.820
Who else?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.080
Who else is working
on something?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.550
You can't all be IT people.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.976
Yes, sir.

00:05:36.976 --> 00:05:38.750
AUDIENCE: Personalized
cancer treatment.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.885
BOB JONES: I'm sorry,
say that again.

00:05:39.885 --> 00:05:41.735
AUDIENCE: Personalized
cancer treatment.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:43.620
BOB JONES: Personalized--

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.745
AUDIENCE: Cancer treatment.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.150
BOB JONES: Oh.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.414
Well, tell us a little
more about that.

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:53.289
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.100
BOB JONES: I know that cancer is
actually a family of disorders

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.788
it's not--

00:06:02.788 --> 00:06:07.778
AUDIENCE: For one cancer, there
are about 20 [INAUDIBLE] drugs.

00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:13.766
[INAUDIBLE] And they
are not the same.

00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:17.270
You have to choose
the right one.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.310
BOB JONES: So do you have a set
of molecular diagnostic tests

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.250
which help determine
which form they have

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.766
and therefore which
therapy they should get?

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:37.922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
--personalized drugs.

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:39.630
BOB JONES: And who
will be your customer?

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.149
Who will write you a check,
the patient, the hospital,

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:44.065
the insurance company?

00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:52.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
insurance company [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:53.860
the patient [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.068
BOB JONES: How many of you
are thinking about working

00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:58.004
in the medical arena?

00:06:58.004 --> 00:06:59.300
Yeah, OK.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.020
You know then that there's a
sort of a cluster of customers

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.270
that you have to work with.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.420
The doctor has to
request it, then

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.450
you have to go arm wrestle
with the purchasing

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.740
agent, or the formulary
committee, or whatever.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.180
It's really quite convoluted.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.100
OK, well that gives me at
least some idea of how eclectic

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.410
you guys are.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.150
So what I'm going
to try to do-- Joe,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.840
tell me how to make
this gizmo work.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.650
PROFESSOR: Turn the
switch on the side.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.240
BOB JONES: Oh, God, turn it on?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.680
Really demanding.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.596
OK.

00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:36.220
I like to learn a
little bit about you.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.374
I think we've covered that.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.290
I'm going to try and
provide you with a couple

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.280
of hot tips in the course
of this 90 minutes.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.206
I have the sort of
quaint notion that if I'm

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:45.580
going to ask you
to pay attention

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.079
to me for an hour
and a half I ought

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:50.180
to try to give you something
of value in return.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.960
I realize that's
sort of old school,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.520
but I hope to help you
find some customers

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.100
and succeed with
your businesses.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.960
And I'm going to do that
using a couple of product

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.384
launches that I
was involved with.

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:05.050
There are times when
people speak to you

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.860
and they say, well, there's
been 20 clinical trials done

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.870
and the results are
almost indisputable.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.980
This is not one of those.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.310
This is anecdotal.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.870
You're not going to be
hearing the voice of God.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.032
You're hearing my opinions, and
they may be wrong, disclaimer.

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.240
But I'm going to walk you
through a couple of product

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.430
launches and some lessons
that maybe you'll learn.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.780
And there may be an opportunity
for equal opportunity

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.640
embarrassment in the
course of this evening.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.140
I will fulfill the
responsibilities of leadership

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.070
by embarrassing myself
first, and then I'll

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.390
offer you the
chance to follow on.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:46.410
So I went to a couple schools,
I had a couple normal jobs,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.000
and then I realized there
was something wrong with me.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.310
And left and went
off and started up

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.040
three different medical
companies in a row.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.100
And took a break
from entrepreneurship

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.460
to serve as CEO of
a soy foods company.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.550
It was turnaround.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.360
The company was a dreadful
mess and took a couple years

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.510
to fix it.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.130
Had to fire 75 people
in the process,

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.470
so it was a lot of, sort
of, block and tackle work.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.780
And I thought it
would be kind of fun

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.480
and relaxing to join a
boutique consulting firm,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.990
helping people do what I did.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.640
And it was fun
for a couple years

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.090
and then it got bored--
boring, and I left

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.270
and started another company.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.760
Which I'll tell you
about, maybe a little bit,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.624
in the course of the evening.

00:09:29.624 --> 00:09:31.540
So a couple years ago,
The Wall Street Journal

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.180
did a study, during the last
recession, of who succeeded

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.650
and who failed.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.730
And did the people who
succeeded aggregate

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.050
around any particular plans?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.130
And they did.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.540
One group turned out
to be cost leaders.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.980
They aggressively
cut their costs.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.550
And that was their
differentiator.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.140
That's not you.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.900
The other group were
innovators and they

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.930
focused on building brands.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.580
That might be you.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.130
But there was a
fundamental question

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.980
that the successful
ones asked, which

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.640
is how is your end
user dissatisfied?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.710
Because that's where
the opportunity lies.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.750
And at an august
institution like this one,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.550
it's often thought that
the answer is technology,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.850
but it doesn't have to be.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.950
If there's 50 kids in
town that want a bicycle,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.480
and there's no bicycle shop,
that could be your opportunity.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.050
So I'm going to make an
assertion right up front, which

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.080
is your business
might survive, but it

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.667
won't prosper until you know
what are you really selling.

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.250
And there'll be a
couple times tonight

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.780
when I may interrogate you
ruthlessly on this point.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.180
Who wants it?

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.260
So, literally, who cares?

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.340
And how do you find them?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.170
And I know that our friend
Steve talked to you a little bit

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.860
last night about
raising capital,

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.290
but it's kind of a dirty
secret amongst investors

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.980
that most of them
really live in terror.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.250
Because they know that if
they invest and 10 of you

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.320
guys-- eight of you
are going to fail.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.460
You're all smart, good
looking, charming.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.100
I'm sure you're good to your
parents and all of that,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.430
but you are going to fail.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.950
Which means their investment
is gonna evaporate.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.800
And investors, venture
capitalists in particular,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.050
raise money themselves.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.250
They go around to pension
funds and say, please

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.820
contribute to our fund.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.620
And if you lose
their money they are

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.080
unable to raise a fund next time
and find themselves unemployed.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.390
So, oops, the emperor is
not wearing any clothes.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.020
So when they look at
you, they want to try

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.170
and figure out do you have
a chance of succeeding

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.960
with your business.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.900
And the experienced ones
know, there's really

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.100
one non-negotiable requirement.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.600
And that's you have
to have customers.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.680
You don't need to be smart.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.600
You don't need to
be good looking.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.870
You don't need to get rich.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.100
If you have customers, people
will think you're smart,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.320
you will make money, and
if you make enough money,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.736
they'll think
you're good looking.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.700
So they want to know, do
you have any customers?

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.610
Will you have any?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.980
Do you even know you need them?

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.370
And by the way, have
you done some homework?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.565
How are you gonna find them?

00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:27.870
And how much are they worth?

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.590
Are you going to spend $5
to acquire a customer whose

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.180
lifetime value is $3?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.824
Whoops, probably
not a good idea.

00:12:34.824 --> 00:12:36.740
How long is it going to
take you to get there?

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.650
How many do you need in
order to reach prosperity?

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.780
I think there's two
descriptors that you want.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.880
You'd like to be important
and you'd like to be unique.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.700
And, of course, the sweet
spot is when you're both.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.690
So I think you can make pretty
good argument that air is

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.730
important arguably, not unique.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.410
And I don't want to
traumatize any of you,

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.140
but some would argue that MIT
decals are unique but possibly

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.790
not important, possibly.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.020
So can you make
a decent business

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.150
selling either of these?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.544
Well, yes, no?

00:13:19.544 --> 00:13:20.870
AUDIENCE: People do.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.670
BOB JONES: People do.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.270
People do.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.915
Give me an example of an
opportunity to sell air.

00:13:26.915 --> 00:13:28.280
AUDIENCE: Chem labs.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.920
BOB JONES: Chem labs,
OK, that's a bit exotic.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.410
You guys scuba dive?

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.100
I did my check out dive off
Catalina Island in California.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.460
I was about 100 feet down
in the kelp beds, ooh,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.500
I've got about 15 minutes left.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.310
I would have paid
a lot for some air.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.726
You know those packages that
have all those little bubbles

00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:54.733
in them and you get really
neurotic and pop them all?

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:57.830
You know what that
companies called?

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.150
Sealed Air Corporation,
six billion.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.260
And of course the
opportunity for--

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.700
to take $0.15 worth of material
and sell it for $4 or $5,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.670
obviously, is picking
the right positioning

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.940
and the right opportunity.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.190
So I'm being a little tongue
in cheek here, obviously,

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.820
but the point is
to figure out who

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.100
is going to find your
offering unique and important.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.110
So rather than start
with how fabulous

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.850
your product is, who cares?

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.580
Who actually thinks it's unique?

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.710
Who's important?

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.960
Figure out how you're going
to find them and tell them

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.350
about what you've got,
and then take their money.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.240
Now, simple is not
the same as easy.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.630
This is simple, it's
not necessarily easy.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.580
But what happens if you can't
meet those two requirements?

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.425
I'll give you a hint,
what kind of fish is that?

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.380
Right, that's what's
going to happen to you.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.990
You will flounder.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.810
So let me give you an example.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.370
This was back in the day.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.205
I joined a company
in California.

00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:15.250
It had been 200 million
in annual revenue

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.250
for 12 straight years,
arguably a sleepy business.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.630
And they got bought
by an entrepreneur,

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.950
took them private,
leveraged buyout.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.280
So I want to kick up the
sales of this outfit 50%

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.060
in three years and
take it public.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.840
So we fired the senior
management team,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.110
brought in a bunch of ostensibly
energetic entrepreneurs,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.790
and gave everybody some stock.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.290
So here's some stock for you,
and here's some stock for you,

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.820
and here's some stock for
you, and let's not argue.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.800
Let's make this worth something.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.090
Really, very good idea.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.900
It was highly motivating.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.590
I was running the
clinical nutrition

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.240
division, really profitable.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.840
We would make a liter of
solution, IV fluid, for $3,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.539
sell it for 70.

00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:03.080
Nice margins.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.564
But I had a bad habit of
going out in the marketplace.

00:16:08.564 --> 00:16:10.480
And I did, and I discovered
that this business

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.060
was going to go away.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.950
Managed care was coming,
changes in reimbursement

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.820
structures, et cetera.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.770
And it was going to
go away before we

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.840
had a chance to go public.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.640
This was bad news.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.244
I needed to find
a new opportunity.

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:30.160
So I thought about it.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.510
And I thought, well, if
this science of nutrition

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.927
is so awesome for people who
are in the intensive care

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.010
unit it ought to be pretty
good for people who are

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.500
just out walking on the street.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.540
Maybe we could reposition this,
go for a much broader market.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.970
Nobody had done it.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.430
Power bar didn't exist, none
of those things happened.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.000
But, like most entrepreneurs,
it was a triumph

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.510
of energy over good sense.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.730
I said, let's try that, even
though no model for success

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.130
existed.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.400
I had spent some time at
Baxter and I knew something

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.720
about the market for people
who have kidney failure.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.950
At the time, there were
400,000, the market

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.240
was growing like crazy.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.800
And every one of the
patients who was on dialysis

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.609
went three times a week to
one of 300 dialysis centers

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.520
in the country, all of
which are identified

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.089
in a federal document.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.740
So I knew where to find them.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.280
I knew literally where they
would be on Tuesday, Thursday,

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.210
Saturday.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.600
Now, when your kidneys fail
you can't casually do something

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:39.080
that so many of us do,
which is have a drink,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.560
because you're unable
to eliminate the fluids.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.100
So it's not uncommon
for a dialysis patient

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.400
to gain eight to ten pounds
between Monday and Wednesday.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.490
Part of what dialysis does is
it wrings out that extra fluid.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.600
So these patients
are fluid restricted.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.380
For-- due to other things
that your kidneys do for you,

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.620
many of them are
clinically malnourished.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.360
And the only nutrition
supplements that were available

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.890
were liquids, Ensure,
things like that.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.320
I said, well, duh.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.120
What's wrong with that?

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.850
Why don't we make a supplement
that's high in the stuff

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.960
they need, doesn't have
the stuff they don't need,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.190
doesn't have any fluids.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.180
Let's make a nutrition bar.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.760
We had the technology to do it.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.500
We created something
we called Regain.

00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:32.490
We weren't required to
do a clinical trial,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.890
it was just food, but we did.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.060
Kaiser Permanente, for those
of you who live in California.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.930
Stuff worked.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.570
Got the results
published in the Archives

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.190
of the National
Kidney Foundation,

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.760
peer-reviewed journal.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.300
Good scientific support,
all the biomarkers

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.800
improved, patients got better.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.770
We said, well, we
know how to do this.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.080
We know where to find them.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.050
We know how to find
the market leaders.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.290
Let's call the renal physicians.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.110
Let's call the
dietitians, say we've

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.530
developed something that's high
in what your kidney failure

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.420
patients ought to have and
doesn't have any fluids in it.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.370
And, what do you think?

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:18.310
The typical reaction was I
wish I had thought of that.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.400
So, well, how many
of your patients

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.890
do you think this
would be suitable for?

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.120
They'd say, well, all of them.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.500
How many days a week
would you recommend this?

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.160
Seven.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.950
Say what, how do you
feel about $3 a bar?

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.600
Sounds right to us.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.410
We said, this is a pretty
good little business here.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.522
Let's do it.

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:50.480
We said, how do you feel
about the competition?

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.900
They said, well, yours
is the only one that

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.150
doesn't have any liquid in it.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.680
It's obviously going to have
a stranglehold on this market.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.000
It's perfect.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.150
So we said, well, that's
a pretty good opportunity

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.899
for the corporation,
it's going to replace

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.010
some of the revenues.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.510
Let's make a whole bunch of it.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.950
Let's take the beauty shots
and make the brochures.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.750
Let's haul in the sales force,
set up a commission plan,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.414
train them on how to do it,
give them some incentives

00:20:11.414 --> 00:20:12.580
to go out there and sell it.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.640
And let's launch, which we did.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:24.770
It was a complete disaster,
just an absolute failure.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.860
Revenues came in at less than
10% of what we forecasted.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.730
And, to make matters
worse, I was part

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.040
of the senior management team.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.680
And we would meet once a
week, conference room--

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.810
once a month we would go over
how our business was doing.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.200
So I'd have to stand up in
front of my peers and say,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.312
well our forecast for
this month was $400,000

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:51.386
and we came in at 32.

00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:53.260
They'd say, Bob, didn't
quite understand you.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.386
What was that number?

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:54.885
32.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.070
So what did I do wrong?

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.340
Tell me why.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.253
Yes, sir.

00:21:02.253 --> 00:21:04.930
AUDIENCE: Your customers
didn't like it.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.690
BOB JONES: My customers
didn't like it.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.260
Tell me more about that.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.855
What didn't they like?

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.180
AUDIENCE: They didn't
like the Regain.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.950
They were happy with
the liquid product.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.200
BOB JONES: They were happy
with the liquid supplement.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.010
That's a perfectly
plausible answer,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.715
but it's not the right one.

00:21:22.715 --> 00:21:25.837
It's a very good speculation,
happens not to be the problem.

00:21:25.837 --> 00:21:26.420
Go ahead, sir.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.450
AUDIENCE: Taste?

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.830
BOB JONES: Taste, well
that was a factor.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.380
We thought it
tasted pretty good.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.200
But it turns out when your
kidneys fail, something shifts

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.190
in your palate and protein
tastes like spoiled meat.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.470
Oops, that was an issue.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.240
What was the big issue?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.540
What was the fundamental flaw,
the most obvious thing that I

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.060
did wrong, in retrospect?

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.051
Go ahead, sir.

00:21:51.051 --> 00:21:53.310
AUDIENCE: I have a question,
who paid for the product?

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.440
BOB JONES: OK, that's
a pretty good question,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.100
who paid for the product?

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.090
We're closing in on the issue.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.865
OK, here's a hint, what's
the title of my talk tonight?

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.450
That was a clue.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.850
OK, so what did I do wrong?

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.592
Yes, sir.

00:22:10.592 --> 00:22:12.300
AUDIENCE: You
misidentified the customer.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.550
BOB JONES: I
misidentified my customer.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.260
You may be exempted from the
rest of the course, that's

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.150
exactly right.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.640
Who did I survey?

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.710
I surveyed the clinicians.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.570
But they don't buy it, and they
don't put it in their mouth

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.220
and eat it.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.590
Oops.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.360
Perfectly logical, in
the pharmaceutical world

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.960
you call in the doc, the
doc writes a prescription.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.960
Doesn't matter whether
you like it or not.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.940
You got an ear ache.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.360
Take this stuff for five
days, your ear ache goes away.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.810
Too bad for you if it
doesn't taste good.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.400
If I get her to write the
prescription I'm done.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.090
Not in this business.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.740
In this business, they have
to go to the store themselves,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.660
pay for it with their
own money, but it,

00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:00.170
eat it, like it,
and buy it again.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.990
Well, when we finally talked
to them, they didn't want it.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.480
And they couldn't afford it.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.910
OK, who gets end-stage
renal disease?

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.050
Well, it turns out
that 33% of them

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.540
get there from a lifetime of
mismanaging their diabetes,

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.060
and 44% of them get there
from a lifetime of mismanaging

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.800
their high blood pressure.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.200
So 3/4 of my target
customers have not

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.810
taken care of themselves
for their entire life.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.540
Why would they start now?

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.940
Furthermore, once
your kidneys fail

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.090
and you end up on dialysis,
a well-intended social worker

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.890
sort will say,
well, Bob, you got

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.740
to be in here tethered to this
machine three days a week.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.930
Obviously you can't work, so
I'll put you on public aid.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.140
Well, now you don't
have any money.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.290
If you do have $5,
you're going to spend it

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.355
on beer and cigarettes,
not on my product.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.680
There's one final issue.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.870
What was our sales channel
at the IV nutrition company?

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.060
We sold to hospitals.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.590
With this business, we had
to sell to retail pharmacies

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.120
and they wouldn't carry it.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.270
Well, let's talk about
that for a minute,

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.728
because that's kind
of fundamental.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:24.060
If you ever want to have a
laugh on a Saturday afternoon,

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.180
walk up to the pharmacist
in your local Walgreens

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.090
or CVS and say, I've got
a product you've never

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.150
heard of from a company you've
never done business with,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.980
and I'd like you carry it.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.060
And watch as he falls on
the floor and hysterics.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:43.710
Why?

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.720
Well I wasn't
familiar with this.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.540
I'd never had any
exposure to this world

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.410
and finally, one
day, one of them

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:58.540
kinda put his arm around me
and said, Bob, come here.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.660
See this foot of shelf space?

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.990
It's a linear foot, right?

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.150
I have Crest toothpaste on
that foot of shelf space.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.610
I have all these
complex algorithms

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.770
that are going to tell
me, within a couple

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.130
of dollars, how much revenue
this for a shelf space

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.640
is going to generate
for me each month.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.550
Now, if I make room
for your product

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:23.140
and push Crest off there,
put your product on.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.910
I don't want to lose any money.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:31.880
So, don't go to any trouble,
just write me a check.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.640
They call it slotting fees,
you might call it extortion.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.988
With most of the major pharmacy
chains this tab is $1 million

00:25:42.988 --> 00:25:46.810
a quarter, plus 6%
of your top line

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.830
revenues, plus
guaranteed resale,

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.620
so if it doesn't sell to ship
it back to you for full credit,

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:57.780
and you put one SKU in
each of their stores

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.600
and fill the entire
pipeline for free.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.620
They'll pay you, if
anybody reorders.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.680
It's pretty expensive.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.090
Well, we couldn't afford that.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.650
So, we had a few problems
with this business model

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.240
that we'd put together.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.970
And we were trying
to show Wall Street

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.450
we were good candidate
for a public offering.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.150
And if we had our
public offering

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.750
the stock that we handed out
was going to be worth something.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:25.770
My failure was jeopardizing
our ability to do that.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.990
Which meant not only was I'm
the doghouse with my boss

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.155
but also with my peers.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.540
And each month I
would say, well,

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.920
you know it's taken a
little longer to take off

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.820
than we thought.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.130
Give us a while to keep
moving with the sales force.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.500
And each month it continued
to be a train wreck

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.836
and it went on for
an entire year.

00:26:51.836 --> 00:26:55.080
It ruined a year
of my life because,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.180
as this gentleman
said over here,

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.975
I misidentified my customer.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.800
So, what did we do about it?

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.400
Well, we learned
about inside sales.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.870
We said, 25% of these people
take care of themselves.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.230
We ought to be
able to find them.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.400
Furthermore, somebody
ought to pay for this.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.600
Let's try Medicaid.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.480
Now, you may or may not know
that Medicare covers you

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.850
if you're old, it's
a federal program.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.830
Medicaid covers you if you're
broke, it's a state program.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.880
What do you think
are the chances

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.060
that Illinois and Indiana
have the same program?

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.470
Real slim.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.590
We got it reimbursed
in 40 states.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:43.520
It was almost as fun as 40
consecutive dental extractions.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.330
I said, this is
just a god-awful way

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.930
to make a living,
sold the business.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.820
Parenthetically, yes,
we did well enough

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.160
in our group with
our other products

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.780
that we compensated for
the shortfall with this.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.510
And when we sold the business,
we didn't make any money

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.110
but we recouped our investment.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:12.640
So I escaped financially
intact, spiritually

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.730
battered and abused, much
wiser, but considerably sadder.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.970
But let's fast-forward
a couple years.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.120
I did two more of these
things and got better at it

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.970
and after a while got
recruited by a group of docs

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.680
at Harvard Med School.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.490
And they hauled me
in from California,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.940
tough sales pitch to my family.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.840
Because we were in
Southern California.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.955
They said, it snows
in New England, right?

00:28:39.955 --> 00:28:40.860
It does.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.560
So we launched a new
company with these guys.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.010
We looked over all the stuff
that they were working on,

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.300
figured out none of
it was going to come

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.060
to market before we
ran out of money,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.240
said well how you guys
feel about diabetes?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.450
The answer was, well,
we like diabetes.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.290
OK, well, we need to be in
a field that's big enough

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.930
to get us noticed
and a need that's

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.710
small enough that we can handle
it with one poor underpaid

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.430
employee.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.260
So I had tuition that
there was something they

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.500
needed and weren't getting.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.200
Statistics, at the time
there were 10 million people

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.720
diagnosed with diabetes, 4
million of them used insulin.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.430
You have diabetes and
you eat something,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.790
your blood glucose goes
up and it stays up,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.980
because insulin incorporates
it into the cells

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.390
and brings it back down.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.280
And if your body stops
generating insulin,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.770
or if you stop being
sensitive to insulin,

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.090
then it stays up and causes
all manner of problems.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.040
4 million of these
10 million people

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.050
injected insulin to
lower their blood sugar.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:55.210
And if you get it wrong your
blood sugar goes too low.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.510
Well, most of the publicity
for the damage that's

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.190
done from diabetes comes
from it being too high.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.380
It's a leading cause of
blindness, kidney failure,

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.250
and peripheral amputations.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.125
So it's catastrophic.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.790
Introducing tight control--
that's three meals a day,

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.030
three small snacks a day,
regular injections of insulin,

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.870
restricts the
bandwidth, good thing

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:23.200
to do-- triples the incidence
of low blood glucose.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.190
And it must be treated right
away, because you faint,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.340
which is bad if you're
stuck in a traffic jam.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.800
And it's particularly bad if it
hits you while you're asleep.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.644
If you're awake, you start
feeling clammy and tremulous,

00:30:39.644 --> 00:30:41.310
and you know you've
got a couple minutes

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.930
to go drink some orange juice,
or eat a candy, or whatever,

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.440
and elevate your
blood glucose again.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.680
But if you're asleep
you may not wake up.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.250
OK so what do they do about it?

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.940
Well, typically, big injection
of insulin, big nighttime

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.460
snack, the hope, that the
two will balance each other

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.960
in the course of the evening.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.440
Unfortunately it doesn't
work because everything

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.430
in the nighttime snack turns
into glucose at the same time.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.490
So the spike is higher,
but the duration no longer.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:17.250
Translation, grossly
oversimplified,

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.710
is that the food runs out at
about 2:00 in the morning,

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.150
and the insulin
is still working,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.870
and from 2:00 am until you
get up is the danger zone.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.540
We had a bunch of focus groups.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.220
I lost control of myself, threw
the moderator out of the room,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.280
walked in, and said,
well, now that we've

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.890
explained this stuff
to you, tell me

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.660
what your greatest
fear really is.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.980
What do you actually
worry about?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.600
And they all sort
of said, well, I'm

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.810
afraid I'll die in my sleep.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.610
I sleep in that La-Z-Boy
in my living room,

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.590
or I have alarm clock goes
off every hour or two,

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.655
just to make sure I don't have
a good night's sleep, ever.

00:31:57.655 --> 00:32:00.520
I thought, well,
that's gripping.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.160
And the parents of
kids who had diabetes

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.450
say, every night I
worry about my daughter.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:11.130
I go and I check on Jessica
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.890
My wife and I stand there
and say, is she awake?

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.672
I mean, is she asleep,
or is she in a coma?

00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:18.490
Well I don't know.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.355
We say, Jessica, wake up.

00:32:21.355 --> 00:32:22.300
What, what?

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:22.950
You all right?

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:23.741
Yeah, I was asleep.

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.570
Good, go back to sleep.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.640
It sounds comical but
it's quite gripping.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.330
We said, well, we've identified
something emotional here.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.950
So we put together a
combination of nutrients

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.170
that turned into
glucose consecutively,

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.154
sucrose, protein,
uncooked cornstarch.

00:32:44.154 --> 00:32:46.070
Being fundamentally a
marketing guy, of course

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.760
I dubbed it
timed-release glucose.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.297
And those ingredients
are in a birthday cake.

00:32:53.297 --> 00:32:55.130
But we managed to get
a patent on it anyway.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.050
Because if you use those
ingredients in conjunction

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.760
with materials
that say diabetes,

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.945
you're violating my patent.

00:33:04.945 --> 00:33:07.690
How about that?

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.270
Novel and non-obvious to
a person of ordinary skill

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.680
in the art, and you have one
of the great experts as one

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.600
of your resources, that's
your host, Joe Hadzima.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.810
I hope you'll talk
about this a bit later.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:26.620
So we did make it taste good,
tasted sort of like fudge.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.250
And we gave it a
non-medical name.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.700
Would anybody care to guess why?

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.290
I heard a murmur, but
I don't see a hand.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.860
Yes ma'am.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.030
BOB JONES: That is true but
that was not the explanation.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:48.938
Sir?

00:33:48.938 --> 00:33:50.672
AUDIENCE: Bypass FDA?

00:33:50.672 --> 00:33:51.380
BOB JONES: Again?

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.550
AUDIENCE: Does that mean you
do not have to go through FDA?

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.670
BOB JONES: Well, we
didn't have to go to FDA

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.630
but that's not why we gave
it a non-medical name.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:00.150
Sir?

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.108
AUDIENCE: Because you're
trying to reduce fear?

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.590
BOB JONES: Yes, but
perhaps not the fear

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.850
that our audience would think.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.500
We talked to our
patients, our customers,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.520
something I'm going to
encourage you to do.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.060
And they said, Bob,
I'm not a diabetic.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.150
I'm a person who has diabetes.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.739
I'm a lawyer.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.620
I'm a banker.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.949
I'm a professional.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.170
I have a condition,
but I manage it,

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.280
just like you might have a
headache, but you manage it.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.630
It's nobody's damn business
whether or not I have diabetes.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.219
And if I end up in a meeting
that lasts half the night,

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:39.630
and I have to
consume your product,

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.179
I don't want the other people
around the conference table

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.783
knowing I'm medicating.

00:34:43.783 --> 00:34:44.949
It's none of their business.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.110
Thank you.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:55.290
Furthermore, I had been
arm wrestling with the FDA

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.200
because I wanted to put "for
diabetes" on the package.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.970
And what our customers told
me was, if you do that,

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.590
I won't buy the product.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.970
So I was trying very hard to
do the one thing that would

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.260
have scuttled the business.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.530
Fortunately, our customers
advised us and we listened.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.010
And they said, our
kids have sleepovers,

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.170
and they have to do
one of these at night.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.260
And they would rather
eat worms than be

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.940
different from their peers.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.420
So make it look
like something they

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.240
can offer their friends,
like an energy bar.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.700
Timed-release glucose, ooh.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.760
Hey, guys, you want one?

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.565
So I said, OK, we're bringing
some consumer marketing

00:35:37.565 --> 00:35:40.700
in to all this science.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.760
So this time around instead
of just talking to clinicians,

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.410
they were important but
they were not sufficient,

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.610
we talked to parents,
we talked to patients.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.140
We went to all these things
at elementary schools

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.930
that parents of kids with
diabetes would attend.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.760
And you know those
little, bitty chairs?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.780
Sat there with our knees
banging against things

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.250
and took lots of moms to lunch.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.160
We learned an awful
lot about this.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.230
How many of you know
someone who has diabetes?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.610
It's really important to go
have these conversations.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.610
And finally, I said, well,
what kind of advertising

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.730
do these people see?

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.060
There are all sorts of
diabetes magazines out there.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.930
So I bought a half
a dozen of them.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:28.140
And the typical ad was on the
back cover, a full page blow

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.030
up, of a hypodermic needle.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.030
Just the thing to make you
feel warm and resonant, right?

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.530
I mean the copy
would say, my needle

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.760
is sharper than his needle.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.440
It doesn't hurt
as much, buy mine.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.610
I said, ew!

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.810
So we put together an
ad with this agency

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.240
that had flying pigs.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.380
It was just so ludicrously
out of place in this magazine,

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.450
nobody turned the page.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.400
And there was some kind of
lame copy about sleep perchance

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.150
to dream, et cetera, right?

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.100
Everybody read it.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.250
We ran a little violator
across the corner of the ad.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.850
It says, for a free sample
call 1-800 and our number.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.790
Stuff started happening.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.190
We were at 238 Main
Street, up above

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:20.996
what was, at the time, a barber
shop, in a little ratty office.

00:37:20.996 --> 00:37:24.250
When we started getting
100 calls a day,

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.390
we needed more phones.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:29.060
200 calls a day, we
said, jeez, we better

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.640
get some people to
answer the phone.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.890
Kendall Square, of
course, has more geniuses

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.730
per square foot
than most places.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.930
So we basically just went
downstairs with a mirror,

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.534
and we held it under
people's noses,

00:37:40.534 --> 00:37:42.450
and if it fogged up we
said, would like a job?

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.190
And filled the office.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.880
300 calls a day,
we said, God, we

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.900
can't keep track of these
people on index cards,

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.470
we better install a database.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.520
500 calls a day.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.750
500 calls a day, we went off
and rented some of these tables

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.934
and stuck like three
computers on the table.

00:38:01.934 --> 00:38:04.350
And we got all these people
sitting there, elbow to elbow.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.450
We said, I think
we're onto something.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.400
I'm going to fast-forward
to something here.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.740
We ended up in all of
the major pharmacy chains

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.760
and all of the
major wholesalers,

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.800
I'll tell you about
that, and the amount

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.780
we paid for slotting
fees was zero.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.470
Unprecedented, in our field.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.040
I think the lesson is that
understanding our customer, as

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.090
opposed to with Regain-- thank
you for your observation--

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:38.170
helped us build a better product
and a successful business.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.400
So how did we reach them?

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.620
Well, we said, who
influences them?

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.910
Who's our customer?

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.560
Who's their influencer?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.220
How do we reach the influencer?

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.680
Where do they spend their money?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.455
And we discovered--
all right back up.

00:38:54.455 --> 00:38:56.520
I hate to be crude but
there are some people

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.300
who have diabetes who
are just determined

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.220
not to take care of themselves.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.320
So should we spend time and
effort trying to reach them?

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.697
So how do we find the ones
who do take care of themselves

00:39:10.697 --> 00:39:12.280
and, furthermore,
are willing to spend

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.520
a little money on their care?

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.540
Answer, they're
seeing a clinician.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.700
The clinician is called a
Certified Diabetes Educator.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.530
And their association, I
know this will astonish you,

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.710
is the American Association
of Diabetes Educators.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.360
And if you go on
their website, there's

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.820
little tab, locate an educator.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.370
You put in 02142 out
comes a list, names,

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.940
contact information, et cetera.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:41.797
We said, well, what do
the educators worry about?

00:39:41.797 --> 00:39:43.380
We know what the
patients worry about.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.550
Patients worry they're
going to die in their sleep.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.520
They go see an educator, what
does the educator worry about?

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.630
Who would care to speculate?

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.230
What do the diabetes
educators worry about

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:58.875
that we could hook
onto in a phone call?

00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:01.350
AUDIENCE: That their patients
are gonna die in their sleep?

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:02.766
BOB JONES: Well
that's one, they'd

00:40:02.766 --> 00:40:04.550
like to know that
what you have works.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.900
Thank you.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.370
What else?

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.790
When I ask them,
what's your greatest

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.280
professional frustration?

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.190
Anybody care to guess
what their answer was?

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.032
Yes, sir.

00:40:20.032 --> 00:40:21.390
AUDIENCE: People weren't
following the advice?

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.360
BOB JONES: Oh my god,
that's absolutely right.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.090
I tell them what to do,
and they don't do it!

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.220
Drives me crazy.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.680
We hear it over and over
again, single greatest

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.615
professional frustration,
the medical term, of course,

00:40:33.615 --> 00:40:35.450
is compliance.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.190
They don't comply.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:45.330
So we said, well, we need to
figure out how to address that.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.840
So we'd call them up, having
located and-- by the way,

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.570
I know these days an
increasing number of people

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.700
are terribly uncomfortable
picking up the phone

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.500
and calling someone
without five emails

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.050
to set up the appointment first.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:06.800
So this may strike you as
emotionally difficult to just

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.980
make cold calls, but we did.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.377
And when they'd answer
the phone, we'd say,

00:41:15.377 --> 00:41:17.710
our company's worked with a
group of docs out of Harvard

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.030
Med School and
we've invented what

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.840
looks like a candy
bar for addressing

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.290
nocturnal hypoglycemia.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.550
And the patients love it.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.242
Do you have 30 seconds?

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.540
Say again?

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.830
And we'd talk to them.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.190
The last thing we would
say in the conversation

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.082
is, who else that you
know should we call?

00:41:44.082 --> 00:41:46.290
Oh, you've got to call my
friend, Susie Cream-cheese,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.260
she would absolutely love this.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.150
So we'd call Susie
Cream-cheese and we'd say,

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.810
Susie, Janet says we
ought to call you.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.160
Oh, well, how's Janet?

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.920
Well, you know, her
dog's got a hip problem,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.260
going to go in for surgery,
but other than that Jan--

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.820
Oh, she loves that dog.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.860
Yeah, she does.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.200
Anyway, she said we should call.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.690
Building relationships, right?

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.290
So we started doing this stuff.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:11.080
Pretty soon we ended up
with several thousand,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.750
highly trained clinicians
talking about our product

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.590
on our behalf.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.070
And their reward
was not financial.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.186
Their reward was that their
patients came back to see them

00:42:22.186 --> 00:42:23.980
and said this stuff's awesome.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.109
And they complied.

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:27.400
So we built a little flowchart.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.030
We said, we have a
sales force, and we're

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.950
calling on the educators.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.710
The educators, if
we do this right,

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.560
will tell their patients.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.120
The patients will call
us and buy the product.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.950
Well that's attractive,
but it's not

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.050
the path to financial heaven,
because there's this group out

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.440
there called retailers.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.650
How do we get into
the retailers?

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:55.910
Maybe we could have the
educators call the retailers.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.540
Maybe we could have the
patients call the retailers.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.120
Maybe then we could
call the retailers

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.177
and we'd make more money.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:10.600
Well, this weekend, if
you have the opportunity,

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.760
stand in a pharmacy and
watch the pharmacist

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.710
when they answer the phone.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.179
They've got this phone tucked
in their ear, pharmacy?

00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:19.970
You got 12 seconds.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:32.520
So how did we address this?

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.987
Well people would call, we'd
send them a free sample.

00:43:36.987 --> 00:43:38.820
By the way, we had to
put in some questions,

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.270
because we made it under
one of these web pages that

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:45.534
said this outfit's
giving away free fudge.

00:43:45.534 --> 00:43:47.950
So we got plenty of phone calls
from people who were never

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.990
going to be our customer.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.690
So once we figured
that out we had

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.220
start asking some
qualified questions,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.480
tell us what brand of insulin
you're typically using.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.570
If we heard, uh,
oh, I'm sorry, we

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:00.050
don't have anything
for you, next.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.580
Right?

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.040
But we'd send them a
sample, we'd follow it up.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.230
Did you get our product?

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.730
Yes.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:08.370
Did you wake up dead?

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.070
No.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.870
Must have worked.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:12.810
Guys, that was a joke.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.590
We're providing free shipping
if you care to order.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.660
OK, love it.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.960
We'd take their order,
we'd track it carefully,

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.840
we'd call back and say,
aren't you about out?

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.881
Don't you need some more?

00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:31.940
Why, yes.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.750
Then one day, we'd
say, you know,

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.662
this free shipping
is coming to a close.

00:44:36.662 --> 00:44:38.870
And we're going to have to
start charging you for it.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.870
And I know you go someplace
to buy your insulin,

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:42.940
wouldn't it be more
convenient to buy

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.140
the stuff at the same
place you buy your insulin?

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.630
Well, yeah it would.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:47.765
OK, we did some homework.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.760
There was about 3% of the
people in the country,

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.680
at the time, that had diabetes.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.210
And they were worth about 24%
of retail pharmacy purchases.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:03.600
Because you go in and buy
toothpaste and a greeting card,

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.750
they go in and buy a blood
glucose monitor, strips, right?

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.720
And they're worth
a lot of money.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.300
So we'd say, well,
why don't we set up

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.840
so you can pick it up wherever
it is you buy your insulin?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.740
Where is that?

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.712
And they'd say, oh,
Jost's Pharmacy.

00:45:19.712 --> 00:45:21.420
We'd say, would you
mind if we call Jost?

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.430
No, no, no.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.250
You tell that turkey that
Mabel wants to buy this stuff.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.950
I've been buying
from him for years.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.220
Well hold on a second, let
me get you his phone number.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.790
Right, so, Jost would answer
the phone, we'd say, Jost,

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.380
we've just been
selling our product

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.930
to five of your customers
that have diabetes.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:42.070
They want to buy it from
you, and you don't have it.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:43.320
What?

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.000
Who is this?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.590
OK, let me back up, Jost.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.930
And I'd walk him through,
here's the five customers.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.081
So what can we do about that?

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.580
Jost would say, well, you know,
we probably ought to have it

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.170
but I can't possibly buy this
without corporate approval.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.020
I mean, we're just
one Walgreens, right?

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.603
I mean, you've got
to go to Deerfield,

00:45:59.603 --> 00:46:01.850
to corporate headquarters.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.660
Jost, we know that.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.650
But we also know that there's
a level below which you can

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.320
buy without corporate approval.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.690
That number's probably $100.

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:13.350
Well, yes, it is.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.340
Well, you'll be pleased to know
that our initial starter pack

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.070
costs $99.95.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.972
And I can take your
purchase order right now.

00:46:21.972 --> 00:46:23.430
And by the way, if
it doesn't sell,

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.650
you don't need to ship it
back to us for a refund.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.816
We'll take your word for it.

00:46:26.816 --> 00:46:27.900
Throw it in the trash.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.430
We'll send you back the money.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:35.120
OK, nobody ever
mentioned slotting fees.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.740
Why not?

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.060
What did we have that
gave us the ability

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.900
to trample all over
that convention?

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.150
AUDIENCE: Customers?

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.580
BOB JONES: Who said customers?

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.996
Excuse me.

00:46:46.996 --> 00:46:48.890
While my heart beats.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.170
That's exactly right.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:58.560
So, we've talked
about this a bit

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.760
Oh, you know, there was
a neat thing we did.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.740
A lot of these educators
would have a class

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.400
on Saturdays, one
Saturday a month,

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.950
they'd bring in all
of their people,

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:09.829
talk about new developments
in diabetes care.

00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:11.370
And like everybody
who's got to write

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.050
a monthly column, or
a blog, or whatever,

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.900
it's hard to come
up with content.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.690
So we'd say, well, when's
your next one of these?

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.342
Oh, it's a week and a half.

00:47:20.342 --> 00:47:22.050
Do you have your whole
agenda set up yet?

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:22.902
No.

00:47:22.902 --> 00:47:24.860
If you like this, would
this be something worth

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.190
talking about to your
patient population?

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.160
Well, yeah, actually.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.970
Well we'll send you the stuff,
we'll send you the literature,

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.960
but let's suppose
they do like it.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.570
They're going to ask you
three questions, how's

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:45.222
it taste, how much does it
cost, where can I get it?

00:47:45.222 --> 00:47:46.912
It tastes like
chocolate fudge, you'll

00:47:46.912 --> 00:47:48.120
figure that out for yourself.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.380
It's $1 a bar.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.020
How do we answer
the third question?

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:59.420
Oh, man, there's a ShopRite
I send all of my people to.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.856
Well, can we call him and
tell him that a week from now

00:48:02.856 --> 00:48:04.730
you're going-- or a week
and a half from now,

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:05.940
you're going to be
sending some people?

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.249
No, we can do better than that.

00:48:07.249 --> 00:48:09.540
Tell that bone head to get
in here on Saturday morning,

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.400
he can stand up and
talk to them him self.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.980
And he can see what we're doing,
and he'll stock the product.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.210
Very cool.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.860
Pharmacists would agree, nobody
ever mentioned slotting fees.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.655
And I bet, you know why not.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.990
So this was good, now we
were in with the retailers.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.630
But, one day, we
discovered retailers really

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:38.020
didn't want to deal with us.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.520
They want to deal
with wholesalers.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.320
Why not?

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.690
Well, there's about
5,000 different items

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:49.410
in even a small
drugstore, and they

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.280
don't want to be
sending out 5,000--

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.090
taking in 5,000 invoices and
sending out 5,000 checks.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.610
So the wholesaler
consolidates all

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.340
that, the truck comes,
brings them a bin,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.590
sends them one bill.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:03.219
Now if you think getting
into a retailer is difficult,

00:49:03.219 --> 00:49:04.010
try the wholesaler.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:14.630
So we said, well, if we could
do this, oh my goodness, we'd

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:19.030
just need wheelbarrows to
carry out all the money.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:20.640
How do we do it?

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.570
We said, well, what do the
wholesalers care about?

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.510
The wholesalers want
to know that there's

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.570
an order already there, this
is going to be painless.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.850
They're fundamentally lazy,
make it easy for them.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:40.734
We said, OK, what can we do?

00:49:40.734 --> 00:49:42.650
We looked about and
realized there was a trade

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.580
show coming up in New Orleans.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.710
We hadn't planned to go,
but we said we ought to go.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.120
And let's find
the 25 drugstores,

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:55.350
I think it was Walgreen's,
that are surrounding the area.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.490
And let's tell them that
we're going to be at the show,

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:00.520
we're going to be meeting
with the educators,

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.580
and we're going to be pimping,
excuse me, selling our product,

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.370
and that they should stock it.

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:10.090
And, in fact, they
should pre-order it.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.430
Which we did.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:14.950
They took the orders, or, pardon
me, they gave us their orders.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.950
And then we called
the wholesaler

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:20.940
that Walgreen's used and
said, you don't know me,

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.850
but I've sold a
bunch of this product

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.866
and I've built in
a margin for you.

00:50:25.866 --> 00:50:28.350
You don't have to do anything.

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.530
I'm going to take
their order, I'm

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.610
going to ship their
product, I'm going

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.620
to send you the money that you
would have earned if you've

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.495
done this, even though
you haven't earned it,

00:50:37.495 --> 00:50:39.380
and you haven't done anything.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.900
What I want is for you
to put us in your system.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.210
Just key us in the system.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.900
So if they reorder,
they can call you.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.555
And I've built a
business for you.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:54.260
Tell me that again.

00:50:57.169 --> 00:50:59.710
But I want to be able to say to
the Walgreens when they said,

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:01.584
jeez we've sold all that
stuff, we could say,

00:51:01.584 --> 00:51:02.950
great call your wholesaler.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:04.070
He's got it.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.520
Of course, he didn't,
but he was in the system.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.820
Wholesaler called us, poof.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.300
Off it went.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:17.170
One last example, we
got a letter one day,

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.020
sitting in the office, from
a major retail pharmacy

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.480
chain headquartered in
Clearwater, Florida.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.390
We're drawing up our
planogram for the coming year.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.100
Who can tell us
what a planogram is?

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.998
Sir.

00:51:31.998 --> 00:51:33.495
AUDIENCE: Layout of the store.

00:51:33.495 --> 00:51:35.432
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:35.432 --> 00:51:36.765
BOB JONES: That's exactly right.

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:43.690
When you walk in, and you
see all these products

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:47.550
in different places, they've got
that laid out like a blueprint.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.920
And many places, in
fact, have a room

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.666
somewhere near their corporate
headquarters with shelves.

00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:55.040
And they put stuff on it, and
they step back, look at it,

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.350
and they photograph it.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.190
There's a lot of analysis.

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.820
We're putting together our
planogram for the coming year.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.450
If you'd like to
be a part of it,

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.120
you have to come to
Clearwater, Florida,

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.500
for a 15-minute meeting.

00:52:10.262 --> 00:52:12.720
We didn't solicit this letter,
it just, sort of, washed in.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.540
They, evidently,
had heard about us.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:21.630
So I said, who
runs this meeting?

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.160
Well, it's a guy named Jeff.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.100
I called a few people
I knew in the industry

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.650
and said, how is Jeff
rewarded for this?

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:32.420
And they said, Jeff
spends a whole week

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.730
having one 15-minute
conversation

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:38.660
after another, all day
long, five straight days.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.290
Oh my god, this
sounds like something

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.160
out of Dante's
Inferno or something.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.950
This is terrible.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:47.520
But he's rewarded by the
amount of slotting fees

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:52.330
but he can extort from
these eager vendors.

00:52:52.330 --> 00:53:00.410
I said, well, we don't have any
money, but let's do it anyway.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.729
So we went down there, and we're
sitting in this huge lobby.

00:53:03.729 --> 00:53:06.270
And there are all these people
with these poster boards, that

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:09.140
look like in end caps and
briefcases that open out

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.640
to be these fabulous displays.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.880
And they're all like,
god, can I walk your dog?

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.600
Can I pick up your dry cleaning?

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.360
Please put me on your shelves.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.370
There were two of us there,
and we were empty handed other

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:25.454
than one little portfolio.

00:53:25.454 --> 00:53:26.870
We came in and we
said, Jeff, this

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.220
isn't going to be like your
other 15-minute meetings

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.350
this week, because we're a start
up, we don't have any money,

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:35.740
we're not going to
give you a nickel.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:39.030
But we propose to spend five
minutes telling you who we are,

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.580
five minutes telling
you what our product is,

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.220
and five minutes telling you
why you want us on your shelves

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.410
anyway.

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.625
And he sort of kicked
back in his chair

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:52.660
and he said, well, it's
your fifteen minutes, sport,

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.180
whatever you want to do.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.790
So we've spent the
first ten minutes

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.865
saying, we're so fabulous,
as you would expect.

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:09.980
And the last five minutes,
we said, Jeff, this printout

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:14.180
is of the people
with diabetes that

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:19.750
have contacted us in the
states where you have stores.

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:23.150
There's 10,000 of them.

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.740
All of us are asking
us the same question,

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.892
where can I go to
buy your product?

00:54:28.892 --> 00:54:30.850
How would you like us to
answer their question?

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:41.470
He sat there, and he looked
at us for almost a minute.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.720
Which is like, hold your
breath for a minute sometime,

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.345
it's agonizing.

00:54:48.021 --> 00:54:50.395
And then he started grinning,
and he said, OK, you're in.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.670
So we said, well, we
want to stage this.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.610
We'll go in where
we built the demand,

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:00.200
I hate returns, and et cetera.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.180
But nary a word
about slotting fees.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.580
I bet you can guess the next
thing that's going to pop up.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:08.150
Why no?

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.450
What gave us that
negotiating power?

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:11.220
We had--

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.600
AUDIENCE: Customers.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.670
BOB JONES: Thank you.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.790
It wasn't for being smart, or
charming, or anything else.

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:19.770
It was just good,
old, hard work.

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:24.030
But we came in there
and essentially said,

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:27.510
you're not generating
the demand, we are.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.238
So we're not paying you for it,
we're bringing you business.

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:37.270
So, impressive growth in
sales, real high reorder rate,

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:38.550
a lot of good publicity.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:41.900
Ended up selling the business to
a billion-dollar pharmaceutical

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.398
firm.

00:55:43.398 --> 00:55:44.231
Everybody was happy.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:59.050
So, I was 10 years older
at the end of two years,

00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:01.760
but I learned a lot.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:07.275
So tell me, what should
I have learned from this?

00:56:07.275 --> 00:56:09.400
What might you have learned,
given that many of you

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.050
raised your hands
when you said you

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.650
were in the process of
doing all this stuff?

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:15.560
What should I have learned?

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.320
What should you have
learned that will

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.930
help facilitate your
progress with your business

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:23.080
and my current venture?

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.290
So let's have some hands.

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:27.530
Tell me what I should
have learned from this,

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.470
and which, maybe,
can have gleaned.

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.520
What mistakes should
I avoid going forward?

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.680
What things should I
do that were right?

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.310
Help me out.

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.210
In the back, yes.

00:56:41.769 --> 00:56:42.644
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.856
BOB JONES: Did
everybody hear that?

00:56:56.856 --> 00:56:58.980
OK, let me paraphrase.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.240
With the first
one, the disaster,

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.310
I did focus on some
of the stakeholders,

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.980
but not the key ones,
not the customers who

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.360
are actually going to buy it.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.000
It's important to
know, and I think

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.810
I asked this question
of one of you, who's

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:12.950
going to write the check.

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:14.730
Who's actually going
to put their money

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:16.500
on the table for this?

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.070
And then who influences them?

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:24.380
So that's certainly one of
the more painful, but crucial,

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:25.810
lessons.

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:27.750
Anything else?

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.360
That's fundamentally
it, by the way,

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.040
but if you've got nothing
else, listen to that.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.657
Yes, sir.

00:57:32.657 --> 00:57:33.532
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:42.680
BOB JONES: Well,
we certainly tried.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.430
This gentleman said we made it
almost impossible for everyone

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.300
we contacted to say no.

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.430
How did we do that?

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:52.880
Go ahead, sir.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.130
AUDIENCE: You built up demand.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:56.120
BOB JONES: That was part
of it, but each time I

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.470
called somebody
that didn't know me,

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.867
what homework did I do first?

00:58:00.867 --> 00:58:01.742
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:01.742 --> 00:58:02.616
BOB JONES: Pardon me?

00:58:02.616 --> 00:58:03.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:05.900
BOB JONES: Finding out
what motivates them.

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:09.340
What do they care about?

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:14.610
People think of selling as
this, sort of, tainted activity,

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.070
and it can be.

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.220
But a hugely important
component of it

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:23.470
is just finding out
what people want.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:27.630
OK, I think you need to know
what they're really buying.

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.260
And I think you have to
have some positioning.

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:32.420
I think if you have a
product that's for everyone,

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.040
I'm sorry to tell
you this, but it's

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.580
my opinion that it's
not actually for anyone,

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.690
you need some focus.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:41.830
And I am also sorry to
tell you, nobody actually

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:43.190
needs you product.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:44.400
They might need the benefits.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.680
I actually don't
need these glasses,

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.090
what I need is to see better.

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:55.270
So I hired, in the
consumer sense of the term,

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.080
I hired glasses.

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.960
Some of you hired
contact lenses.

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.200
Some of you I'm willing
to bet, hired the surgeon

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.630
to do the little
laser procedure.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.720
But all of us had the
same fundamental need,

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.370
we wanted to see better, we
just took different routes

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:11.660
to get there.

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.810
So sell the benefits first.

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:17.590
And I'm a huge believer
in market segmentation.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:19.609
I don't think everybody
on the market is equal,

00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:21.150
and I think there's
a lot of them who

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:22.525
aren't going to
be your customer,

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:28.580
and I like to segment them by
motivation to buy what I have.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.250
I think there's a small group at
the top feeling the pain right

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.110
now.

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:36.340
Underneath that, I
don't know, let's say

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.390
I have something that reduces
the likelihood of heart

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:41.670
attacks.

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:43.910
So if you had a heart
attack yesterday,

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.090
and you're still
alive, you could

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:47.440
be a good customer for me.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.940
If you're not
alive, I'm sorry, we

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.380
won't do any business together.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:56.120
His immediate family,
they're in the second tier.

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:56.910
They're worried.

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.900
Sheesh, maybe we should
pay attention to this.

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.390
Down below that, people
who are kind of vigilant.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.560
And then there's a huge
bunch of people that's

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.200
just a graveyard for you.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.150
Don't go there.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:09.310
Start at the top.

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.950
Couple reasons, if you can't
build a business there,

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:15.200
time for your next idea.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.330
Think of yourself as a jockey.

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:21.510
Not as a horse.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.270
If you start at the
top and you fail,

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:26.190
you might be a very
good jockey you just

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.480
picked the wrong horse.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.450
Pick another horse.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.420
Also, by the way,
if you're thinking

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.930
one day you might
sell your venture,

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:42.250
you can go to big company
X, Johnson & Johnson,

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:46.370
and say, guys I spent
$1.98 and penetrated

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.480
that block at the top.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.650
You have a million dollars,
you can take it further down,

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.584
you can do the math, let's talk
about the discounted value,

01:00:55.584 --> 01:00:57.750
future earnings, and pull
together a little purchase

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:58.830
package.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.100
Right?

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.400
If you can't succeed at the
top, you don't have a story.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.770
But if you want to
change your buying habits

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.210
it requires a lot of motivation.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.470
And I'm sorry if this sounds
manipulative, it's just blunt.

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.190
I think pain is
very motivational.

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:19.660
Fear, greed, vanity,
these are-- I'm

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:23.510
not trying to list the
seven deadly sins here.

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.310
But ask yourself,
what would cause

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.860
people to stop doing
what they're doing now

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.410
and buy what you have.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:35.260
Are they dissatisfied with
their current cancer care?

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.230
Are they dissatisfied with
something that you've got?

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:41.530
What's going to motivate them
to change their buying habits?

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:45.060
And, I gotta tell you,
virtue is a tough sell.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:53.750
Buy my vitamins because 20
years from now the antioxidants

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:57.470
will have caused you
to have fewer mutations

01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:00.310
at the end of your chromosomes.

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.920
[WHISTLES]

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.730
I don't think so.

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:09.540
So, with that as a context,
what was I really selling

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.980
with the one that failed?

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.320
I was selling virtue.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.275
Take this stuff and your
bio markers will improve.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.810
What was I really selling
with NiteBite By the way,

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:25.380
answer that question for me.

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.200
What was I really
selling with NiteBite?

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:29.741
Sir?

01:02:29.741 --> 01:02:30.740
AUDIENCE: Peace of mind.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.390
BOB JONES: Peace of mind.

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:33.530
That's exactly right.

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:37.450
In fact, once we figured that
out, all the lights went on

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.900
and the ad copy wrote itself.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.850
It was corny, one bite
and the rest is easy.

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:49.270
But we got it, that's
exactly what we were selling.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:53.240
So with no disrespect
whatsoever,

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.697
you have a question?

01:02:54.697 --> 01:02:56.905
AUDIENCE: Going back to
dealing with the wholesalers,

01:02:56.905 --> 01:02:59.827
how do you know that
the slotting fees wasn't

01:02:59.827 --> 01:03:03.560
a big part of their
revenue and not

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.620
having them would be a no-go?

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.900
BOB JONES: Well I knew, in
fact, that slotting fees were

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.760
a big part of the revenue,
and not having them,

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.270
normally, would
make for a no-go.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:20.570
But what I produced for them
was a pretty, nearly guaranteed

01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:25.510
income stream which exceeded
the value of the slotting fees.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.880
I also introduced the
topic of competition.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.910
I said, our customers
have mentioned you

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:40.430
as their favorite pharmacy, or
our customers, the pharmacists,

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.860
have mentioned that the
wholesaler they most like

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.880
to do business with is you.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.020
They have, of course,
other wholesalers.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.380
They don't concentrate all
of their eggs in one basket.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.690
I'm hopeful that we can do
business, because otherwise I

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.470
will have to go to number two.

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.130
So how would you like me to
handle their need, can we

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:57.760
work together?

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:05.850
Don't get me wrong, we did
get told no from time to time.

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:08.101
And, in fact, if you're
going to be an entrepreneur,

01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:10.350
I hate to tell you this, you
will kiss a few frogs out

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.060
there.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.160
Nature of the beast, right?

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.820
OK as I started to
say, some of you

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.430
are taking MBA courses that
are focused on marketing.

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:24.380
I'm going to give
you an entire year

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.965
of business-school-level
marketing in two bullet points.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:37.320
Find out what your customers
want give it to them.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.505
End of lecture.

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:43.480
Now, there's all manner of
sophisticated regression

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.220
analyses, et cetera,
et cetera, that

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.890
can be employed to do this.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.680
But if you lose track of
these two fundamental points,

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.000
you've missed the point.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.504
So, focus.

01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:00.820
And I hated the boss I had,
that said this to me, because I

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.995
could never get it out of
my head, drove me nuts,

01:05:03.995 --> 01:05:05.570
it was so corny.

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:08.940
He'd say, Jones, there
is no hocus-pocus

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.530
that takes the place of focus.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.220
I'd think, you're killing me.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.180
But it's true.

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.550
So a different way of looking
at this, it's not sales,

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.920
it's detective work.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.410
If you are to succeed,
do some detective work.

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:31.530
Find your customer rather
than promote your product,

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:33.400
because your customers
hire these things

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.840
to do a specific job.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.940
Design your product
to do the job

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.030
they want for a
specific customer.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:41.200
Go find them, and if
you've done this right,

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.740
the selling will be easy.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.550
How do you do it?

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.090
Talk with them.

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:50.120
Cold calls, oh god.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.420
Literally, phone calls.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.350
Emails are helpful, but
they're not adequate.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.320
Talk to them.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.520
Surveys are helpful,
they are not adequate.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.680
Talk to them.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.170
Some years ago, I
wanted to do a deal

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:07.080
with a group in Finland that
had invented a margarine that

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.490
lowered cholesterol.

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:10.210
And I was intrigued.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:13.070
Johnson & Johnson offered them
a huge sack full of money,

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:17.380
our startup couldn't
compete, we lost.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:23.180
But I watched what
J&J did, and I went

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.760
into a number of supermarkets.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.290
It actually didn't take long.

01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:31.810
I stood off to the side near
where people had the margarine,

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.270
and I would watch
customers come in.

01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:36.920
The stuff that J&J had
was about eight times

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.810
as expensive as
traditional margarine.

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:41.440
Margarine shoppers
would come in,

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:47.760
and they'd look and
say, $1.19, $1.39, $8,

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:53.760
$1.4-- $1.4-- I'll
take the $1.39.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.110
So I would stop these
people and say, excuse me,

01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:59.110
I was thinking of
buying this $8 stuff,

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.480
and I noticed you didn't.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.010
How come you didn't?

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:03.620
Oh man, I got all
manner of other ways

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.950
to take care of my cholesterol,
and besides I don't feel bad.

01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:10.180
So talk to them.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.410
Know them.

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:12.810
How do they view their problem?

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:15.450
And think about your
service and ask yourself,

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:17.080
how are they solving
the problem now.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.980
More importantly, what are they
spending their money on now

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.011
to solve this problem?

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.427
And there's a great quote
attributed to Henry Ford.

01:07:29.427 --> 01:07:32.010
We said, Henry, do you ever ask
your customers what they want?

01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:33.765
And Henry said, oh
hell, if I'd asked them

01:07:33.765 --> 01:07:35.765
what they wanted they'd
have said faster horses.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.830
So understanding
what's behind that

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:43.990
was part of Henry's genius.

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:45.223
You do have competition.

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:53.930
OK, my Regain customers
needed my product.

01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:56.980
They didn't want it,
I couldn't sell it.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.350
So what matters is
finding people who want it

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:04.330
and figuring out how to
communicate the benefits

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.340
in just 30 seconds.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:10.300
And this is harder
than you think,

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.170
because if you don't
really understand

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.180
the benefits good
luck trying to put it

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.770
into collateral material,
put it on your website,

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:18.987
any of that stuff.

01:08:18.987 --> 01:08:21.195
And, of course, as Steve
probably told you yesterday,

01:08:21.195 --> 01:08:22.970
you are unlikely to raise money.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:25.160
Customers buy benefits.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.620
So, some of the questions,
what's broken we fix?

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.700
Who cares?

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.479
Do they have any money?

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.580
As a working musician
I know that it's just

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.920
futile try to make
something for that market.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.700
Guitar players are all starving.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.790
How do you find them?

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:43.950
How are they solving it?

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:46.700
Why is what we have better?

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.770
I'm going to zap through
a couple of these.

01:08:52.592 --> 01:08:54.300
I want to spend a
second on this, though,

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.049
is this all right?

01:08:55.049 --> 01:09:02.550
All right, something that we're
doing with our little outfit,

01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:05.630
we said-- we're not the only
ones doing this, mind you,

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:06.880
but we are applying this.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.880
Start with the ideas, identify
some unmet needs, et cetera,

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.540
go interview people who
might want it, and then

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.899
make a bare bones
version of the product.

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:18.939
We're making a
2.5 ounce beverage

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:20.520
that helps you sleep at night.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.450
And we made a little
prototype, and it looks bad,

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:27.189
it tastes bad, and you
can't get the cap off.

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:30.640
Arguably, this is not a good
profile for a retail product.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.170
But we had one primary
concern, does it work?

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.830
We give it to 30 people
and nobody goes to sleep,

01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:38.319
well then we stop right there.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:41.020
Silly to have spent any
time making it look good.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.760
So go out there
and see if you can

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.080
identify customers for launch.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.770
And, in fact, the first group
of customers that we thought

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.710
would be suitable for
our business turned out

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:51.540
to be wrong.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.990
I had a really bad five
or six weeks where I got

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:59.470
told no, all day, every day,
for five or six straight weeks.

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.750
Finally figured out,
they don't want it.

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:05.990
They might need it,
but, time to iterate.

01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:07.630
Once you get it
right, then you can

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.710
get about the business
of doing your branding

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.645
and packaging more formally.

01:10:11.645 --> 01:10:13.270
And then you can get
about the business

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:14.730
of growing the company.

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:17.590
And, by the way, you might be
able to raise a little money

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.460
at a couple of those points.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.351
A little money to
build your prototype,

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.350
and then, once you figure
out what you're doing,

01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:26.240
a little money to actually take
something to the marketplace,

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.470
because you have
reduced the risk.

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:33.550
But that stage of the
game is hugely useful.

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:35.750
And I submit that that's
what Aleem and his team

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:36.937
have done already.

01:10:36.937 --> 01:10:38.520
They've made a minimum
viable product,

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.550
they're circulating
a pancake mix,

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:43.740
and they're getting
valuable customer feedback.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.220
Aleem, your recipe calls
for sparkling water.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.100
I don't keep sparkling
water at home.

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.410
How can I make pancakes
without sparkling water?

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.910
Oh, well, useful, right?

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:56.220
OK, so we're going to
skip what I'm doing now.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.390
Though, of course,
it's fascinating.

01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:00.402
We're out of time.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:08.650
So, I have one set
of final questions.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:10.310
Where do customers go for help?

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:11.810
How are you going to reach them?

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:16.720
Paint a picture of who's going
to write you that first check.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.590
What evidence do you have that
they will pay for your product?

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:21.400
This was crucial to
me for the gentleman

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.590
talking about calling
on IBM and calling

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:28.697
on people who would want
his augmentation of Google.

01:11:28.697 --> 01:11:31.280
What evidence do you have that
somebody's going to pay for it?

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.100
How much?

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.110
And then, it calls
for someone who's

01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:39.390
a kind of a pervert to actually
be responsible for sales,

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:41.895
although some of us like it.

01:11:41.895 --> 01:11:42.770
Who's going to do it?

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.980
I don't think we have time
for anymore of your questions,

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.600
with regret, so
let me summarize.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.400
The only non-negotiable
requirement

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.342
for successful business
is your customers.

01:11:54.342 --> 01:11:55.800
And if you're going
to succeed, you

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.660
have to have something
that's unique and important

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.440
for someone.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.170
You gave us a great
example of pivoting that

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:06.270
from the head of IBM
to college students.

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:08.990
It's got to be
important to someone.

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:12.435
So figure out who can't live
without it, go find them

01:12:12.435 --> 01:12:15.410
and tell them about it,
and take their money.

01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:16.910
Thank you very much.

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:21.160
[APPLAUSE]

WEBVTT

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:17.950
ADAM MARTIN: And
today, we're going

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.250
to talk about immunity, which
is important, especially

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.280
at this time of the year.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:39.210
So immunity is the
resistance to disease

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.310
based on a prior exposure.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.400
Based on prior exposure.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.100
And of course, this is the
principle behind vaccination.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.170
So humans have
been sort of using

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.690
the properties of
the immune system

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.970
to prevent themselves from
getting disease for centuries.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.170
One of the first very
clear examples of this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.550
is back in the 18th century with
the English physician, Edward

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.440
Jenner, and Edward Jenner found
out or came to the realization

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.210
that farm hands on
farms, specifically

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.690
milk maids, that were exposed
to a variant of smallpox

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.630
from cows, which is
known as cow pox,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.510
could become immune to smallpox.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.450
So cow pox is a less
severe form of the disease.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100
And what Jenner did
was to take pustules

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.710
from individuals who
had the cow pox disease

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.340
and inject them into
an eight-year-old boy,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.950
and then infect that
boy with smallpox

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.430
to show that the boy was
immune to smallpox after having

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.210
received the cow pox material.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.670
And so this is the first
example of the vaccine.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.740
And because the vaccine was
derived from basically someone

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.500
with cow pox, the
word vaccine is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
from the Latin root
of vaca, which is cow,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.840
so that's where the word
vaccine comes from, OK?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.840
So today, we're going to
talk about the systems

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.660
that our bodies have
to fight disease

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.200
and there are several
different all levels

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.970
of the immune system.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.460
So I'm going to talk
about two of them.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.390
So I'll talk about two
levels of immunity.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.080
The first I want to
mention is the one

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.940
that we're all just
like born with,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.670
which is known as
innate immunity.

00:03:16.037 --> 00:03:16.999
[SNEEZING]

00:03:18.923 --> 00:03:20.380
[SNEEZING]

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.140
Bless you.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.170
So innate immunity,
as the name implies,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.295
is something that we are
born with, so this is inborn.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.300
It also doesn't have a delay
in when it's activated, right?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.330
So if you have an
infection, this

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.750
is sort of the first
line of defense, right?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.310
There is an immediate response,
and that's the innate immune

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.155
system, so this is immediate.

00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:57.060
Here, I'll put this down here.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.900
It's immediate.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.180
So one example is of an
innate immune response.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.810
This is not in the
body but ex vivo,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.330
but here you see a
human neutrophil,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.690
and neutrophils are part of
our innate immune system.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.260
And neutrophils hunt and
kill bacteria, right?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.820
You see that neutrophil
chasing after that bacterium,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.080
and it's going for it.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.780
It's really trying to get
it, but that bacteria really

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.750
wants to get away, but got it!

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.720
OK, great.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.380
So these neutrophils are part
of the innate immune system.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.680
It's inborn, it's immediate.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.060
And in addition, the response
of the innate immune system

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.780
doesn't really
change if you've been

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.760
exposed to an infectious
agent prior to the--

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.450
OK, so this does not change.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.120
I'm using the Greek
delta for change.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.580
Does not change
with prior exposure.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.900
OK, so it's sort of like
a constant surveillance

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.180
mechanism in your body that will
go after foreign agents, OK?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.150
Now, this is very different
from the next level

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.580
of immunity, which is
known as adaptive immunity.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.610
And as the name adaptive
immunity implies,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.640
this is a type of
immunity that does change.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.920
It adapts, OK?

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.250
And this type of
immunity is acquired,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.700
so it's also known
as acquired immunity,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:01.970
but it's acquired with exposure
to a foreign agent, OK?

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.430
So this involves a change in
immunity, this one does not,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.310
but the innate immune
response is immediate,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.490
whereas adaptive
immunity takes time.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.485
There's a delay, so
this is also delayed.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.560
It's also highly specific, OK?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.920
So it's highly specific
to the foreign agents

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.610
that you are infected with.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.300
The innate immune
system is less specific.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.190
It'll recognize, like,
things like bacteria,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.280
but it won't be able to
necessarily distinguish

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.890
between different
types of bacteria.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.520
So this is more specific than
the innate immune system.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.750
This is why every year,
you have to get a flu shot,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.660
because the flu virus
is constantly changing.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.150
And our immune
system is so specific

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.060
that unless we get
a new vaccination,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.280
our bodies will not be
able to recognize it, OK?

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.230
So this is-- so now I'm going
to break down adaptive immunity

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.175
into two branches.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:26.510
One is known as
humoral immunity,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:40.370
and humoral immunity is
basically protein-mediated,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.020
and there are
proteins that mediate

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.480
this are called antibodies.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:59.350
These antibodies are proteins,
and it's called humoral

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.080
because the antibodies
can be secreted

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.860
into the fluids or humors of
our body, which is basically

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.870
the blood, OK?

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.790
So there is humoral immunity.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.160
The other type of
adaptive immunity

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:20.100
is cell mediated,
and one thing I

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.960
want to point out that the types
of cells that make an antibody

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.965
are known as B cells.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.250
What the B stands for
isn't really important,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.980
but one thing that's
helpful is that these cells

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:44.670
mature in the bone marrow, and
B stands for bone marrow, OK?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.590
So you can always remember
where they mature.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.650
Now cell-mediated
immunity, in contrast,

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.780
involves a different type
of cell called a T cell,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.690
and the T of T cell
stands for thymus

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.625
because these cells
mature in the thymus.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.410
And I just want to point out
where these cells come from.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.970
So we talked about adult
stem cells earlier,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.590
and in this case, these T
and B lymphocytes over here

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.340
are derived from a
multipotent hematopoietic stem

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.970
cell, which generates
a whole bunch

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.900
of different types of cells.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.580
Many of them are involved in
the innate immune response,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.450
but this common lymphoid
progenitor over here

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.040
gives rise to D--

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.890
T lymphocytes and B
lymphocytes, which are

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.060
involved in adaptive immunity.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.960
OK, so it's not important
that you remember where--

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.690
what all these cells come
from or what they, like,

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.220
what the tree is, but
that these cells arise

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.030
from a common progenitor cell.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:14.080
OK, so both of these branches
of the adaptive immune system

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.260
have what are known
as antigen receptors.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.470
I'll abbreviate antigen, AG.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.220
So they have antigen
receptors, meaning

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.680
that they have
things on them that

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.510
recognize specific antigens,
and antigens are basically

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.510
things that result in
an immune response.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.190
They could be proteins.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:54.150
Antigens are substances that
activate the immune system.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.740
That's just immune system, OK?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.350
Another abbreviation
that I'll use

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.220
is when I refer to an antibody,
I'm going to abbreviate it, AB.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.130
All right, so we have these two
branches of the immune system,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.250
and they each have the
type of antigen receptor,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.580
so now I want to go through
what these different types

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.750
of antigen receptors
look like, OK?

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:44.770
And I'm going to start with the
B-cell antigen receptor, also

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:53.460
known as the antibody, also
known as an immunoglobulin.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.450
OK, so another-- these
are all synonymous,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.420
but you will see them
in different contexts.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.220
Immunoglobulin is
abbreviated IG.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:14.170
And what the antibody
looks like structurally,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.250
it looks like
this, and I'll just

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.950
draw it out for you down here.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.080
So I'm drawing a
lipid bilayer that

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.430
represents the plasma membrane.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.730
The outside of the
cell is going to be up,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.140
so that's the exoplasm up here.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.580
The inside down here
is the cytoplasm.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.230
And this would be a B cell,
then, we're talking about here.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.800
I'm going to draw just a segment
of the B cell plasma membrane.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.540
And the B-- the antibody can
have a transmembrane domain

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.220
that spans the plasma membrane,
and then there are domains--

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.050
and what I'm drawing here is
a circle, is an IG domain,

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.435
so this is going to
equal an IG domain.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.510
It's just a type of protein
fold that is modular, OK?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.900
So you can see up on
my diagram here, right?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.520
You see these like here there
are these two green segments

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.810
labeled V and C. Each of
those is a single IG domain.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.870
OK, it's just a
modular fold that

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.720
is separate from the
other part of the protein.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:40.740
OK, so here we have along--

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.500
this is one
polypeptide chain that

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.650
has a transmembrane domain, and
it is inserted into the plasma

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.150
membrane.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.800
The N-terminus is here, the
C-terminus is down here,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:14:01.440
and each antibody protein has
two of these long peptides.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.470
And because they're the
longest part of the molecule,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.410
they're known as heavy chains,
so these are the heavy chains.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.500
And each antibody protein
is composed of two

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.840
identical heavy chains, OK?

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.070
So these are identical.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.550
And then also there's
another component,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:27.090
which is present up here, and
this is a shorter polypeptide.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.670
And because it's
shorter and smaller,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.460
it's known as the light chain.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.760
OK, that's the light chain.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.310
OK, so that's more or less
what an antibody looks like.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.400
The part of this
antigen receptor that

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.430
recognizes the antigen
are the tips right here,

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:55.030
so this is where
the antigen binds,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.180
and it can bind on either
this side or this side.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.570
This molecule is
laterally symmetric.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.880
One side is identical
to the other, OK?

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:15.830
Now, the T-cell receptor
looks different,

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.790
and the T cell receptor
has fewer names.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.030
It's just called the T-cell
receptor, or the TCR,

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.770
for short.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:28.450
And the T-cell receptor is
structurally very different,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.860
so now I'm drawing here
a T-cell plasma membrane.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.600
Here's the plasma membrane.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.970
The exoplasm, again, is up.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:42.220
The cytoplasm is down
below this plasma membrane.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.380
And the T-cell receptor
has two chains.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.970
One is called alpha
and the other is beta,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.660
and it has fewer
immunoglobulin repeats,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.730
so that you can see you just
have this sort of smaller

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.090
system here, where you have
an alpha and a beta chain.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.760
And in this case,
this region here

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.990
recognizes the antigen, OK?

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.280
So basically the T-cell
receptor, or the tip of it,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.880
interacts with the antigen.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.320
Now, the B-cell receptor,
or the antibody,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.910
has different forms, so let's
talk about the different forms.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.060
And these are shown up
on my slide above, right?

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.690
So you see over here,
here is an antibody that

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.720
has a transmembrane domain
and is anchored in the plasma

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.510
membrane, but there's
another form that

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.660
lacks that transmembrane
domain, and instead

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.660
of being an integral
membrane protein,

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.070
is instead secreted
into the blood, OK?

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.770
So the forms of
the B cell receptor

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:59.380
are both a membrane-bound
form, which is initially

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.670
how this antibody is
presented, but later on, it

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.790
can be secreted, and
this often changes

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.480
when there is an infection, OK?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.810
So once you have a virus
or bacteria in your system,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.750
then you get the B cells
sort of pumping out

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.550
the secreted form
of the antibody

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.220
in order to fight
the infection, OK?

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.780
In contrast, for
the T-cell receptor.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.720
For the T-cell receptor,
there's only one form, which

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.210
is the membrane-bound form, OK?

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.910
So for T-cell receptors,
it's membrane only.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.370
OK, another thing that differs
between these antigen centers

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:47.290
receptors is the types of
antigens that are recognized.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:52.020
So antibodies can recognize all
sorts of different molecules,

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.520
OK?

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.290
They're very
promiscuous, but they--

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.180
and a given antibody
is not promiscuous.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.030
A given antibody will recognize
a very specific structure,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.340
but the possibility
for antibodies

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.910
is that they can
recognize small molecules.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:19.330
They can recognize proteins,
they can recognize DNA,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.820
they can recognize
carbohydrates,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.560
you get the idea, right?

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.420
They really can recognize a
whole range of different types

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.440
of molecules.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.550
In contrast, the T-cell
receptor is more restricted

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.110
in that T-cell receptors will
recognize peptides or short

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.850
sequences of amino acids.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:50.240
So it recognizes peptides,
and these peptides

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:59.480
are presented to the T
cell on a type of molecule

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.400
presented by the MHC complex.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.210
There are two classes,
1 and 2, and we're

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.660
going to talk about this in
detail in Friday's lecture.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.330
So I just want to point
out the difference

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.080
in the types of antigens
that can be recognized here,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.010
and we'll talk about exactly
what that means on Friday.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.490
OK, so now we have to talk
about the amazing properties

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.940
of the immune system.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.460
The first is how specific
it is, its specificity,

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.560
and I think this is a really
amazing property, the ability

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:48.130
to really discriminate between
very closely related molecules,

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:48.940
right?

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.450
And this is essential for
immunity to work well.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.040
You want to recognize things
that our foreign agents that

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.500
have like invaded your system.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.330
You don't want to be recognizing
proteins and structures that

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.550
are natively present
in your body,

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.890
because if your immune
system did that, you'd

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.730
have an autoimmune disease,
so this specificity

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.180
is really crucial for the
function of the immune system.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.770
So now I want to talk how is it
that the immune system achieves

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.390
such high levels of
specificity, and the way

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.990
I want to illustrate
this is I want

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.810
to bring this down quickly.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.470
So if we consider the
structure of the antibody,

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:43.000
these different domains
are different in that--

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.340
in how variable they are,
so some are variable.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.700
So this domain here
for the heavy chain

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.520
is the variable domain of the
heavy chain, which I'll just

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.260
abbreviate VH, and then these
other immunoglobulin domains

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.850
are constant, meaning they
don't have a lot of variation

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.320
in sequence.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.080
Like the heavy chain,
there is a variable domain

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.740
for the light chain,
which I'll abbreviate VL,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.840
and then there is a constant
domain for the light chain, OK?

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.530
And so what I want
to do now is consider

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.790
what the sequence variation
is here on this antibody

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.290
is the same over here.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.450
This is the same
thing over here.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.810
You have a variable
domain for the heavy chain

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.910
and a variable domain
for the light chain.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.460
So let's consider the amino
acid sequence of the antibody

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:46.220
molecule specifically at that
variable part of the protein.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.470
So let's say we could
take individual antibodies

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.700
and define their sequence
from end to C-terminus.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.160
That would be from tip
towards the end here.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.960
So if we take a number
of different antibodies

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.380
and align their
amino acid sequence--

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.210
so what I am--

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.640
I'm not writing out an
amino acid sequence,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.310
but I'm just illustrating
like a particular type

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.310
of computational
experiment you could do.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:24.880
So these would be aligned
amino acid sequences

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:31.180
where each of these represents
a different antibody, let's say,

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.680
heavy chain polypeptide that's
produced from a different B

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.700
cell, OK?

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:45.490
So each of these is a different
antibody from a unique B cell.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:56.260
And then we just consider
the residue number

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.840
and how much each
amino acid residue

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.130
varies along this sequence.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.990
So if we were to align antibody
gene stretches like this

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.480
and look at how much
variation there is,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.540
you'd get a graph that
looks like this, OK?

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.460
So the y-axis is the
amount of variation

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.700
and the x-axis here
is the residue number

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.630
along this polypeptide sequence.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.070
And what you see, probably
even without the color here,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.830
is that there are these
three regions where there's

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.110
a lot of variation
in the sequence

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.240
of different antibodies, OK?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.930
So here you see the blue segment
here has a lot of variation,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.330
the yellow segment has
a lot of variation,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:49.870
and the reds segment here has
possibly the most variation.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:59.650
And what these are known as
are hypervariable regions,

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.080
meaning that they exhibit
a lot of variation.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.470
Another name for
them is that they

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.860
are complementarity-determining
regions.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.892
Complementarity.

00:24:10.892 --> 00:24:12.655
Complementarity-determining.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:28.930
Determining regions,
or CDRs, and there are

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:33.550
three of them, 1, 2, and 3, OK?

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.090
So there are regions in
this antibody molecule

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.140
which are much more
variable than others, OK?

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.330
So what are these regions?

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:48.280
Well, this is a sort of
crystal structure of the--

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.400
of an antibody, and you
can see how the antigen is

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.110
bound at the end.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.330
That would be this
end of the molecule

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.520
or this end of the molecule.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.440
And here you see
a ribbon diagram

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.300
of the structure
of the antibody,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.820
and the complementary
complementarity

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.790
determining regions
are the regions here

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.840
that contact the antigen.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.090
And what they are
are basically here's

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.650
an IG fold, this whole thing,
and there are these three loops

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.500
that extend out of the
end of this molecule,

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.650
and you can think of them
as three fingers, OK?

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.280
Then these fingers are able to
reach out and sort of grab on

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.120
to like a foreign particle
and/or any particle

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.630
and stick to it, OK?

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.740
So these are the
variable regions,

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.040
and they have differences
in amino acids--

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.460
in amino acid sequence,
and even very small

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:56.230
differences in the
amino acid sequence

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.010
at this particular
part of the antibody

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.770
can have a huge effect
on whether or not

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.660
they're able to stick
to something, right?

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.670
You can imagine if
I lost my thumb,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.220
then right now, I'm not
able to sort of stick

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.290
to that anymore, OK?

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.860
So small differences
in amino acid sequence

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:24.610
result in large changes in
the affinity of this antibody

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:31.630
for an antigen. And antibodies
have different sequences,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.750
meaning that they're able to
bind to specific substances

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.490
differently.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.980
So if an antibody has
one set of sequence,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.260
it might recognize
one structure.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.033
If it has another
sequence, it might

00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:46.200
recognize another structure.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.290
So just by changing
the sequence at

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.090
these
complementarity-determining

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.630
regions has a huge influence
on what these proteins will

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.080
bind to, OK?

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.340
Now, each B cell expresses
a unique antibody

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.700
and just one unique antibody.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:18.000
So each B cell in our body
expresses one and only

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.100
one antibody protein,
and that antibody protein

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:29.630
has a unique sequence
at the CDR region,

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:44.450
and this one antibody has unique
specificity for an antigen, OK?

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.970
So here you can
see in my diagram,

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.520
I have a whole bunch
of B cells here.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.300
They all express a
different antibody,

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.030
and you can see that the way
you could get more of a given

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:01.310
antibody is to clonally
expand one of these cells,

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:05.240
and all of the cells that result
from that colonial expansion

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.670
will express the
exact same antibody.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.230
And when you have a clonal
population of a cell

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:23.750
that all has the same antibody,
that's known as monoclonal, OK?

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.580
So each B cell will have a
B-cell receptor or an antibody

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.930
with unique specificity.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.120
So now the question
becomes, OK, so I told you

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.490
how you get specificity,
but in order

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.620
to have a functioning
immune system,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.320
you need to have lots
of different cells

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.210
that each express a
different cell receptor,

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.480
so there needs to be a
way to generate diversity.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.440
And the answer to how
we generate diversity

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.110
has an MIT connection.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:04.910
The research wasn't done
at MIT, but the person

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.810
who discovered the
mechanism is now at MIT.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:16.190
This research was performed
by Susumu Tonegawa,

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.460
and Professor
Tonegawa, for his work

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.980
on how this diversity
is generated,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:29.640
was awarded the Nobel
Prize in medicine in 1987.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.390
OK, so Professor Tonegawa
did this research elsewhere,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.230
but now he is a faculty
member here at MIT.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.860
All right, so diversity.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.410
The problem of diversity, right?

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.420
We have millions of B cells
that have a unique antibody.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.950
OK, so one solution
to this problem

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.830
would be we have a million
different antibody genes,

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.180
and each B cell clone sort
of expresses one of them

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.540
OK how many genes do we have?

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.495
Anyone know, roughly, on
the order of magnitude?

00:30:05.495 --> 00:30:06.370
Do we have a million?

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.142
What's that?

00:30:07.142 --> 00:30:08.350
AUDIENCE: 30,000?

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.200
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.850
Yeah, so Mr. George
has suggested--

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.560
Miles, I believe.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.460
Yeah, OK, good.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:20.170
Miles suggested 30,000, which
is the good upper limit, right?

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.080
So having a million
antibody genes

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.490
sounds a little
bit unfeasible, OK?

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.490
And so it's basically
unfeasible for us

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.760
to express as many
antibody genes

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.330
or have as many antibody
genes as we have antibodies.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.350
We just don't have enough
real estate in our genome, OK?

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.840
But there's another
solution to generate

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.510
the diversity,
which is essentially

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.760
a form of shuffling.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:55.430
So we have a single heavy
chain gene for antibodies,

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.060
and we have two genes
for the light chain,

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:04.090
but these genes are composed
of multiple gene segments.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.340
There are multiple
gene segments.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.250
Specifically, the
segments that make up--

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.990
that generate this
variable domain is composed

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:23.310
of multiple gene segments,
and these gene-shaped segments

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.030
are shuffled during the
development of the B cell

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.700
to give rise to
different proteins.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:36.390
OK, so these gene segments
are shuffled to generate

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.380
this diversity.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:47.550
OK, so now I'm showing
you on the top here,

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:53.300
this is the human immunoglobulin
heavy chain locus here.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.600
You can see it's pretty big.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.310
There are lots of components.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.070
I want you to focus on this.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:04.020
So there is-- you see in orange,
there's this variable gene

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.820
segment, and there are 45
variable gene segments here.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.190
There's this
diversity, or D segment

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.360
here, which there are
23 of, and then there

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.480
are six of these
joining or J segments.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.020
OK, so these are all
distinct parts of the gene.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.600
They're all distinct
parts of the exon

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.360
that encodes this variable
region of the antibody, OK?

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:44.835
So you have multiple V,
D, and J gene segments.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.220
And in order to generate
a functional antibody,

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.820
one V has to be brought
together with one D, which

00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:02.970
has to be brought together with
one J for that heavy chain, OK?

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.600
So you have multiple
V-D gene segments,

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:14.700
and they have to
be brought together

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.767
to form a functional antibody.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.540
OK, that's illustrated
right here.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.390
So here you see this
is the light chain.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.630
For the light chain, there are
only V and J gene segments.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:35.310
V For the heavy chain,
there there's V, D, and J.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:39.040
And so most of the
cells in our body

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.390
and the cells of our
germline, at the very earliest

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.460
stages of development,
all have this arrangement,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.270
where you have
everything still intact.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.130
But during lymphocytes
development,

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:54.960
specifically in lymphocytes,
there is a recombination event

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.675
that brings together V
and J segments or V, D,

00:33:58.675 --> 00:34:01.740
and J segments, OK?

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:09.420
So this is mediated
by recombination

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:23.219
at the heavy and light chain
genes for that antibody, OK?

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.010
And so this is very different
from the recombination we

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.520
talked about earlier in the
semester, where recombination

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.159
is happening during meiosis and
the formation of the gametes,

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:33.659
right?

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:36.239
In that case,
recombination is happening

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.550
between homologous chromosomes.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.280
Here we're not talking
about recombination between

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.330
homologous chromosomes.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.239
We're talking
about recombination

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:49.170
that brings together
and deletes segments

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.650
along a single chromosome
to bring these V and J

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.600
segments together, OK?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.820
So this is sort of
a intra-chromosomal

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:01.350
recombination, which deletes
the intervening sequences

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:05.280
and brings these gene segments
together to form a functional

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.540
antibody protein.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:17.040
So this process is known
as V(D)J recombination,

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.765
and this is lymphocyte specific.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.710
OK, and that's because during
the development of B and T

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:36.370
cells, there is an induction
of recombinases that

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.260
mediate this recombination.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:45.830
So in this case, there
is recombination,

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:50.890
which is mediated by
recombination-activating genes

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.660
1 and 2, called RAG1 and 2, OK?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.030
So there are these are
lymphocyte-specific

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:02.050
recombinases which mediate
this rearrangement, which

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:07.270
bring together a unique V, D,
and J segments together, OK?

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.820
So the diversity
comes from the fact

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:21.625
that each of these V, D and
J segments, each V segment--

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.730
you could-- this also applies
to D segments and also J

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.750
segments--

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:29.710
has a unique sequence.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.740
So it encodes for a unique
amino acid sequence,

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.720
meaning that if
you bring together

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.260
different combinations
of Vs, Ds, and Js,

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.110
you get a distinct protein, OK?

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.760
Now even if you had all of the
combinations of V, Ds, and Js,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.650
you still don't
have the diversity

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.570
that we see in the human body.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:59.900
So there is another process that
further generates diversity,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.260
which is the fact that when
these segments are getting

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:07.570
shuffled, it's imprecise in
that nucleotides can be inserted

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.000
or deleted as these
segments are joined,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.402
which generates greater
amino acid diversity,

00:37:14.402 --> 00:37:15.235
and this is called--

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.123
it's called junctional
imprecision.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.960
So this recombination
is not precise,

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.780
but it leads to the
insertion or deletion

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:41.420
of nucleotides of nucleotides.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:52.220
And if there's a
multiple of 3 nucleotides

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:57.380
either inserted or deleted, then
you get a functional antibody.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.260
Why is it that it has
to be a multiple of 3?

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.760
Jeremy?

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.880
AUDIENCE: Otherwise, you end
up with a frameshift mutation.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.480
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:04.980
Right?

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.250
This is and the--

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.430
this is on the more sort
of like on the N-terminus

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.170
side of the gene, right?

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:16.030
So if you inserted one
nucleotide between V and J,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.420
then the downstream portion of
the gene, the downstream part

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.260
of the open reading frame
would be out of frame

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.630
and wouldn't generate
a functional protein.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.340
OK, so it has to
be a multiple of 3.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.800
Yeah, Georgia?

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.010
AUDIENCE: How is functional
precision lymphocyte-specific?

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.260
Or is it not?

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.550
ADAM MARTIN: It's
just the RAG1 and RAG2

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:42.239
are turned on specifically in
the lymphocytes as they mature.

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:45.140
AUDIENCE: And that also affects
the insertion, deletion?

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.265
ADAM MARTIN: Well, if you
don't have recombination,

00:38:47.265 --> 00:38:49.580
you can't get junctional
precision, right?

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.580
So the junctional imprecision--
or junctional imprecision.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.610
The junctional imprecision
is a consequence

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:59.000
of the recombination
process itself, right?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.100
So if you're not
having recombination,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.350
you're not having any
junctional imprecision

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.750
because you're not
generating a junction.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:10.130
OK, now there's one more
thing that's important here,

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.820
which is something
that happens not

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.220
as a consequence of this
recombination process

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.390
but as a consequence of
activating the T cell

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:24.950
response, which is that in
addition to these variations,

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:29.240
there's also something
known as somatic mutation.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:40.400
So there's an elevated
mutation rate at the IG locus

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.270
that further increases the
diversity of the amino acid

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:49.250
sequence at these variable
regions of the antibody, OK?

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.130
Another way this
is referred to is

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.580
because it can increase the
affinity of the antibody

00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:02.090
for a antigen, it's also
known as affinity maturation,

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.540
so these are synonymous.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.120
Maturation.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.770
Maturation.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:14.390
OK, so-- and this
depends on the T

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:18.870
cell, the cell-mediated
branch of adapted immunity,

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.105
so this is T-cell mediated.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:34.370
So one other aspect
of this process

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:39.320
that I want to talk about
is until this recombination

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.700
happens, the immunoglobulin
gene is not expressed,

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.820
so it's this
recombination that leads

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.960
to the expression of the--
either the heavy chain

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.660
or the light chain gene, OK?

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.770
And that's because the
enhancer is sort of downstream

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:01.440
in the gene, and by deleting
the intervening sequence here,

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.220
you bring the promoter
in range of the enhancer,

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.880
and now this gene
is expressed, OK?

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.980
But remember you have two
copies of each of these genes.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.640
You have a parental copy
and a maternal copy,

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.190
and another feature
of this system

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.070
is that there is what is
known as allelic exclusion.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:29.900
So the system is such that
a B cell expresses only one

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.830
antibody, and so if you had
both alleles expressing,

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:35.900
that wouldn't be the case, OK?

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:40.700
So allelic exclusion makes it
that if you get a recombination

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.960
event that leads to a
functional antibody for one

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.850
of your sort of inherited
copies of the gene, one

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.850
of your alleles, it suppresses
recombination on the other one,

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:54.350
OK?

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:58.460
So you will only get one of
these genes, one heavy chain

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.370
and one light chain,
expressed per B cell.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:12.260
OK, so only one gene expressed
so that each B cell only

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.850
has one antibody.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.290
OK, I just wanted to
point out, finally,

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:28.270
that these junctions
between V-D and J segments

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.600
fall right in this
CDR-3 region, so they're

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.870
responsible for the high
level of variability

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:40.840
at the CDR or
hypervariable 3 region.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.690
OK, and because of
the allelic exclusion,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:48.700
each B cell expresses
only one antibody, OK?

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.730
So all of the antibody
proteins expressed by that cell

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.060
will be exactly the same.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.620
OK, so now the last property
of the immune system we

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.970
need to talk about is memory.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:10.120
And so the immune
system needs to be

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:16.450
able to recall past infectious
agents that it's experienced,

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.010
and so it needs--

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.050
I guess we're kind
of personifying here,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.090
but it needs some
sort of memory, right?

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.795
It needs the ability
to recall this, OK?

00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:29.620
And this is the principle
behind vaccination, right?

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.340
The way vaccines
work is to put in one

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.270
of these attenuated or
inactivated foreign agents,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.610
such that your body is
able to remember that

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.710
later on when you
get the real deal,

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:55.040
and it's able to
fight it off, OK?

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.800
So the body has to
be able to remember.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.920
And several ways in which
this manifests itself,

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.280
if we compare a primary
infection, the first time

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.870
you've seen an infectious agent,
versus a secondary infection,

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.600
they have very
different responses

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:17.600
from the standpoint of the
adaptive immune system, OK?

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.500
So if we consider the lag before
your adaptive immune system

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.970
really takes off,
the primary response

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.410
takes about five to 10
days, so it's a bit delayed,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.490
whereas the secondary response
can be one to three days, OK?

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:35.700
So it's faster.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.080
It's able to react faster when
you see an infectious agent

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.090
the second time.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:45.200
If we also just consider the
magnitude of the response

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.870
by considering how much
antibody, the antibody

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:52.230
concentration that's like
put into your system,

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:56.090
then the primary
response is smaller

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.150
and the magnitude of the
secondary response is larger.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.690
So you basically-- your body's
able to produce more antibody

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:09.920
against an infectious agent
the second time it sees it.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.480
Not only is the antibody
amount better the second time,

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.090
but actually the
antibodies themselves

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.610
are better antibodies, OK?

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:26.750
And we can show that by thinking
about antibody affinity, which

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:30.560
is how tightly the antibody
recognizes the antigen,

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.660
and I'll give you
numbers that represent

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:38.970
the dissociation constant for
an antibody to a given antigen.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.770
So the lower that number
is, the tighter the binding.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:47.030
So for the primary infection,
the antibody affinity

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:52.520
is weaker on the order of 10 to
the negative 7th molar in terms

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.760
of KD, and this
secondary infection

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.340
generates antibodies that are
functionally quite better.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.405
They bind much tighter.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.350
It can be less than 10 to the
negative 11th molar, which

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.530
is sub-nanomolar.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.030
Right?

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.160
That's a really
tight interaction

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.270
between two molecules.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.300
So the antibodies,
you get more of them,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.670
and they're better
antibodies, OK?

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:25.860
So what makes this memorable
is that when-- what lasts

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.700
in your body from the first time
you see the agent to the next

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:40.700
is there's a type of B cell
known as a memory B cell,

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:46.030
and this memory B cell will
express a given antibody,

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:49.760
and that antibody will be
specific to the substance

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.480
you saw previously.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.350
And because recombination
is-- this recombination

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.390
is irreversible,
then that B cell

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.140
is going to remember that
antibody because it's still

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.240
encoded in the genome.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.480
So the memory results from
V(D)J recombination being

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:16.130
irreversible and the fact
that these memory B cells stay

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.830
in your body, even if the
antigen is not present,

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:24.290
so these also stay in the body.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.360
OK, so effective vaccines
generate these types

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.760
of cells, these memory B cells.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.990
OK, that's important if you
want an effective vaccine,

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:43.940
that you have these B cells
that retain information

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.420
about the past infection.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.980
All right, so what exactly
is it that the antibodies do?

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:58.970
So I'll talk about effector
functions of antibodies.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.740
So antibodies can bind
to a foreign substance

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.830
and interfere with the
normal function, right?

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:12.560
If you have a bacteria
and maybe the antibody

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.320
binds to some part
of the bacteria

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.710
to interfere with that
bacteria getting into the cell,

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:22.250
and this type of effect is
known as neutralization.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.060
If you had an antibody
that bound to something

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.700
like a bacteria,
you could also have

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:37.350
it recruit phagocytic cells
to internalize that bacteria,

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:43.190
and so you could also
induce phagocytosis.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:47.090
In addition, antibodies, when
bound to a foreign substance,

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.730
if that foreign
substance is a cell,

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:54.650
then it could recruit a
killing cell to kill that cell,

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:59.750
so there's also a killing
aspect to this, OK?

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.590
So what's in this diagram
here is a type of cell

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.920
known as a natural killer cell
that is killing its target

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.020
cell, and so you
can kind of think

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.320
of this cell as
the Terminator, OK?

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.280
So right, if the natural killer
cell recognizes this target

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.910
here, then it's
hasta la vista, baby,

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:23.690
and that cell is dead, OK?

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:27.780
I just want to point out one
thing that I mentioned before,

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:32.300
which is that antibodies
can be leveraged to generate

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.970
treatments for certain
types of diseases.

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:39.260
And we talked about a drug
called Herceptin-- or not

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.570
a drug but a-- it's
an antibody, but it's

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:47.310
a treatment for HER2
positive breast cancer,

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:52.670
so this is used to treat
HER2-positive breast cancer.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:58.580
And it's really been a nice
success story in the cancer

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.300
field because what this--

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:06.170
what Herceptin is-- it was
derived from a mouse antibody,

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.840
so this is a mouse
monoclonal antibody

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.050
that recognizes this
HER2 growth factor

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.060
receptor, which
is over expressed

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.970
on 30% of human breast cancers.

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:22.430
And what Herceptin is is that
researchers took this mouse

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:26.660
antibody and engineered
a human antibody

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.800
to have the mouse sequence at
its complementarity-determining

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.370
regions, such that you
have a human antibody that

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:38.990
won't be sort of removed
by the human immune system

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:44.150
but will recognize HER2 and
recruit human immune cells

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:48.440
to HER2 positive cells,
possibly killing those cells

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.700
or binding to HER2 and somehow
neutralizing the activity

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.760
of HER2 on these cancer cells.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.570
So antibodies can be very
useful for therapeutics, as well

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:03.990
as being useful in our own
bodies to mediate immunity.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.890
OK, we'll talk about
T cells on Friday.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.400
Remember to bring your projects.

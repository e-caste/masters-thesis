00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:28.770
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Today is--

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.960
it's not exactly a
midpoint of the course,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
but it is a transition
lecture between

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.080
these macro financial models
with micro underpinnings.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.990
Today we're going to go
through the measurement,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.560
and then in subsequent
lectures, focus on testing

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.295
for the micro underpinnings.

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.420
I mean, everything is
connected to everything else.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.940
There's a quote--

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.550
I don't know, many of you
may be familiar with it.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.410
It's really quite good.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.950
Lord Kelvin.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.540
In physical science,
the first essential step

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.500
in the direction of
learning any subject

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.840
is define the principles
of numerical reckoning

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.790
and practicable
methods for measuring

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.090
some quality connected with it.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.730
I often say that
you can measure--

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.460
when you can measure what you're
speaking about and express it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.130
in numbers, you know
something about it,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.490
but when you cannot measure
it, you cannot express it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.540
in numbers, your knowledge is
of a meager and unsatisfactory

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.700
kind.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.440
It may be the
beginning of knowledge,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.260
but you have scarcely
in your thoughts

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.380
advanced to the
stage of science,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.310
whatever that matter may be.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.340
So of course, today we're going
to talk about measurement,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.660
and this is not an
economics quote.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.510
This is a little more related
to both economics and impact

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.440
evaluation.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.390
It's Bill Gates.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.205
He's talking about
the steam engine.

00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:10.229
In his book I think he must have
read on the most powerful idea

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.790
in the world, which is
about measuring the energy

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.130
output of engines with
this my micrometer.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.690
The point-- he's
quoting Mr. Rosen--

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.920
is to see incremental
design changes

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.480
that led to improvement--

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.690
mainly what you want, higher
power and less consumption

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.510
of the coal.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.710
And it was this interaction
between experimenting, trying

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.400
things, measuring
precisely given the goal

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.040
and then innovating
some more that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.250
led to this high-powered steam
engine which revolutionized

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.370
the world, essentially.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.230
So he's saying he's
struck how important it

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.370
is to measure-- to improve
the human condition

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.060
and how incredible the progress
could be if you set a goal

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.090
and measure it.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.990
But then he goes on
to say that he is also

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.030
amazed how little
this is actually done

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.020
and how hard it is to
do it to get it right.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.460
He gives an example
of foreign aid,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.510
just measuring the dollars,
say, that flow rather than

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.270
the underlying impact
that it may or may not

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.375
have on household business
or country welfare.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.870
So the type of measurements
that are needed or those that

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.275
allow us to assess
performance and gauge impact.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.640
So this is the end of
what Bill Gates was saying

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.590
and the rest is
something I want to say.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.520
Measurement is
tricky in the sense

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.730
that he's really not saying
just go out and measure

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.650
anything you want to
consistent with the goal.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.570
For a while the Gates Foundation
was promoting savings accounts,

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.690
having poor people have
access to savings account

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.610
as a kind of panacea,
and indeed, wanted

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.800
to measure the
number of households

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.150
out there now who have
them and track improvement.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.320
And there's a new world survey
done by the Gallup Foundation--

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.390
Gallup people who do
the polls, actually,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.360
have survey
techniques worldwide.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.840
But of course, from
our perspective,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.690
just having a savings account
may not accomplish much.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.700
It's not a kind of
measurement that's really

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.070
assessing the impact on people.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.940
You'd like to know what impact
it's having on welfare--

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.920
that is to say on
actually using it

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.520
or better ability to smooth
consumption or finance

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.980
investments and so on.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.250
Well fortunately
in economics, we

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.440
have one set of measurement
tools that are common,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.070
and they're also consistent
with the theme of the lectures--

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.160
namely there is measurement
at the individual household

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.300
level that's also
consistent with measurement

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.780
of the flow of funds across
countries and everything

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.290
in between.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.560
And what I'm going to
try to go through today

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.380
but here's a quick summary of
it is what these tools are.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.070
Basically you start with
the financial accounts

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.440
for a household or a firm.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.030
So that would be the balance
sheet, the income statement,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.290
and the statement of cash flow.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.430
You may associate that language
with corporate financial

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.530
accounting and wonder
perhaps about its relevance,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.650
but they are the
benchmark standards

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.160
and they can be applied to
households and especially

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.050
to households running
businesses, which

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.880
is the typical enterprise
in developing countries.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:20.130
So I'll show you in a moment
exactly how this can be done.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.550
What use can you
make of these things?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.670
Again, I'm going to try to
buttress my case that it's not

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.560
just measurement for
the sake of measurement,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.130
but actually that you can
use these measurements.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.380
So in this case, we'll
draw a distinction between

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.670
productivity and the return
on assets versus liquidity,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.870
some distinction you could
not make if you were not

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.610
clear-headed as in applying
these financial accounts--

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.790
or at least it would be
quite easy to make mistakes.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.410
And show how-- where
wealth is coming from

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.020
and how wealth
changes over time.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.620
At the household level that
gets you into poverty dynamics,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.940
you can start thinking about the
mechanics that underlie changes

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.960
in inequality.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.520
And again, in an
application, take a look

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.840
at how households are making
a distinction, apparently,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.200
between savings rates
and productivity

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.420
in terms of what they do
in their own investment.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.130
I think you've seen in
the recitation section

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.590
sort of a precursor of
this in terms of the Thai

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.660
data and some case studies.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.230
So in some sense, we're going
to go back to the basics

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.360
and talk about the
financial accounts,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.830
but at least you have
a motivation already

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.050
for what households are doing.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.560
Then we can aggregate
up from households--

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.010
say all households in a
village and create something

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.510
like the national
income accounts,

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.090
except they're not at
the national level,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.580
they're village income accounts.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.450
But we have the standard savings
and investment, GDP numbers,

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.850
and indeed, we get balance
of payments at the village

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.929
level or regional
level just so you

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.500
can see what's going on within
the country, not just of

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.280
the country relative to other--

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.330
and again, you've seen this
come up in the lectures--

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.840
China, provincial-level
China, at the national level

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.920
relative to the
rest of the world,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.340
flows across sectors that
differ in obstacles to trade.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:05.350
And finally, we'll get to the
flow of funds accounting, which

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.690
I like to think of
as the nuts and bolts

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.550
of the financial system
actually measured.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.330
So you don't just
have to imagine

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.390
what's going on in
the country over time

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.030
in response to shocks,
you can actually

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.152
see it in the measurement.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.820
So first paper up.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.720
Not going to work?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.910
Let's not cut off too
much, maybe it's all right.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:50.000
Is to create-- well, I'm
just not fast enough.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.160
Create the balance
sheet, income statement,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.300
and statement of cash
flow for these households

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.720
in order to make the
distinction between productivity

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.530
and liquidity.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:12.330
So this is a quote from
Deaton that I ask often show.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.580
The only way to
obtain these measures

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.680
is by imposing an
accounting framework

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.950
on the data, painstakingly
construct estimates

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.870
from myriad responses
to questions

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.470
about the specific components
that contribute to the total.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.370
So actually, there's
a computer code

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.410
that's you know 18 to 20
pages single-line code,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.880
and it operates
on the Thai data.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.830
It, of course, searches
over all the questions

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.300
in the questionnaire
in order to be

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.940
able to extract the
key variables that

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.910
are needed line
by line to create

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.500
these financial accounts.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.990
We didn't begin with
the financial accounts.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.530
I wish we had, because
then certain instances,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.290
it would have helped
us measure better.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.460
This was something
we came to afterwards

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.470
when we were just struggling
with a simple idea

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.920
of what do we really
mean by income?

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.300
Something very basic.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] more
like 100 page, you think.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.740
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's a lot.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.750
AUDIENCE: And the way that
you look at it is initial.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.667
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:19.470
Version 1, version 2.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.600
OK.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.980
So what are the
problems when you

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.740
have these high frequency
monthly data or to some degree

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.540
even annual data?

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.760
There is a difference
in timing between, say,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.540
when inputs are purchased and
when their outputs are sold.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.380
If you think about farmers,
they only sell at harvest time

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.930
and they're using
inputs along the way.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.790
It's true for businesses, too,
who don't sell instantaneously.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.150
They have to acquire inputs
to produce something or buy

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.455
goods for inventory to stock,
and then subsequently sell.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.850
We are worried about
liquidity, on the other hand.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.090
So since smoothing
of consumption,

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.010
protection of
investment from cash

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.440
flow, financing a
budget deficits.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.600
So we want to make
distinction between cash flow

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.090
in terms of liquidity and kind
of the overall performance.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.710
The key idea with performance
is an accrual notion

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.250
of accounting, which
is simple to say--

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.220
mainly do not book
or subtract expenses

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.080
until the output is sold.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.300
It's the idea of
corporate finance--

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.330
you have projects,
not occupations.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.680
You buy assets.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.420
You have an idea, you need to
fund it, you buy equipment,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.830
and you don't expect
a return right away.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.780
So for the short-run, you
have lots of negative profits,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.600
but it's just a
cash outflow, so you

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.360
wait till you can get
the big picture, which

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.260
is when you get the revenue then
you subtract off the inputs.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.270
But financing the
inputs along the way,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.700
that's a liquidity issue.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.890
And indeed, if
you're running out,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.840
you may as not invest even
though your underlying project

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.970
or idea is quite successful.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.730
So we go to the
financial accounts.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:33.090
Now viewing households as firms,
we have to draw some parallels.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.660
Assets are kind of easy to think
about both on the household

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:42.930
side and on the firm side.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.740
Households have debt just
like firms have liabilities,

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:54.120
so those are straightforward
parallel concepts.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.950
When you think
about wealth, wealth

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.415
is really net worth
on the household side.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.750
The language for firms
is something like equity.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:13.220
It's the amount of the owners'
investment in the enterprise

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:18.600
that's built up over
time that is not

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.980
as different from the fact
that some of the equipment

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.210
gets owned by
outsiders who financed

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.940
the project by lending.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.860
What is the sources
of this wealth?

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.180
Well basically savings,
like retained earnings.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.050
Savings for households, retained
earnings for businesses.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.280
That part of the profits that
you put back into the business.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.210
But also potentially
contributed capital

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.160
which I'll come to in a minute.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.840
This is this may strike you
as odd at first, I'm not sure.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.640
Consumption on
the household side

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.200
is the same as dividends
on the firm side.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.620
So the consumption
we think we know,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.800
but dividends is
like a firm paying

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.460
either the inside owners
or outside investors part

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.420
of the return stream.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.870
So that stuff isn't going
into the firm anymore,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.060
it's not retained earnings.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:26.220
It's kind of the fruit
that you get to enjoy.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.350
This is also a bit of a
stretch and can be problematic.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.800
Incoming gifts on
the household side,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.550
what do we do with them
in the financial accounts?

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.350
Gifts aren't really
income in some sense--

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.120
in the corporate
financial sense.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.990
Because income is a
return stream of projects,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:54.570
but gifts, that's just
something somebody gave you.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.870
Well, so we ended up thinking
about gifts as financing.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.830
So the idea is, someone
gives you a gift,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.160
you have some implicit
idea of reciprocity.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.640
So they're in effect
helping your enterprise,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.950
they're investing
in your enterprise

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.800
even though the contract
may not be nearly as formal

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.765
as, say, an equity arrangement.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.720
And finally, the household
budget constraint

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.680
is like the firm
cash flow constraint.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.740
So again, we can
therefore distinguish

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.200
assets versus wealth.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.750
Note how easy it would be
to make a mistake there.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.860
Isn't that the same thing?

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.400
No.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.270
Remember, the liabilities
get subtracted from assets

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.460
to create, quote,
wealth or net worth.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.670
Accrual versus cash flow
I've said often enough.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.760
Savings as a budget
surplus as in cash flow--

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.050
so you had more coming in in
revenue than you had outflows

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:02.780
in terms of expenses versus a
different notion of savings,

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.839
and that's savings as in
wealth accumulation, that's

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:13.670
where do you put the increasing
wealth that you're acquiring?

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.619
That's more like a
portfolio problem.

00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.500
And therefore, we
need to distinguish

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.401
liquidity management
from asset management.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.900
So quick review.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.900
By the way, I'm really
going to struggle today

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.460
to make sure you don't just
sort of pass out on me.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.650
Because accounting
has a reputation

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.530
as being really
boring, and it is true

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.710
that it gets more
and more tedious.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.690
And so you kind
of like tune out,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.270
like OK, I'll tolerate today.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.100
But no, you'll
discover that when

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.310
you start doing your research,
whether it's looking at data

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.780
from surveys or gathering
data or trying to do--

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.313
and then you'll come back and
you'll be much more interested

00:18:05.313 --> 00:18:05.980
in these things.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.120
So the spirit with which I give
the lecture today is not the

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.660
bore you with the details,
even though at times it

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.560
will be tempting, because once
you've invested in this stuff,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.880
you want to share
that knowledge.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.160
But rather, to give you a
reader's guide or viewer's

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.170
guide of what the
key concepts are

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.980
and how things fit together.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.910
So that latter thing is what
I want you to take away.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.100
So here is a typical
balance sheet.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.120
You've got assets and
you've got liabilities.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.670
The bottom line
has to be the same.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.920
Now how does that happen?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.980
Well, you really
subtract liabilities

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.820
off from the assets, and
hopefully assets are larger,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.390
so the residual is basically
equity or net worth, OK?

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.100
And then this is
just an enumeration

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.530
of different kinds
of assets, which

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.700
include financial and
trade credit and so on as

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.530
well as if-- lending as well
as your real physical fixed

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:17.950
assets, and liabilities are
kind of obvious, and so on.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:25.710
So now let's get
into some cases here.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.320
The Living Standards
Measurement Survey

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.810
makes a mistake if you want
to think of it that way.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.200
They ask about inputs used over
a specified cropping season

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.115
and the amount spent.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.150
And implicitly
they're equating them,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.170
but they don't have to
be equal to each other.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.070
For one thing, you could be
using inputs in your farm

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.280
that you acquired previously--
especially with monthly data,

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.800
it's likely you have some
kind of input inventory.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.430
And for that matter,
you could spend money

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.890
and buy inputs but not
actually put them on the field.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:19.370
And the same thing happens on
the output side, essentially.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.090
What do we do?

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.660
Fortunately in the Thai
survey, we actually

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.480
keep track of both
inputs required

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.550
since the previous
interview as well as

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.080
the actual use, both value
and quantity of inputs.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.555
So we have this input
inventory account.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.928
And revenues I say here,
but don't dwell on it.

00:20:43.928 --> 00:20:45.720
So what do you do when
you have the output?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.320
Well, you could store
it or you could sell it

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.820
or you could eat it.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.460
So you kind of have to
create an output account.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.710
We act as if output is sold
at the time of harvest just

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.190
to put an accurate value on
it, but when, in fact, they

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.960
don't sell all of it or they
eat some and store some,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.290
then we create another sort
of output inventory account.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.240
So in high frequency data,
this sort of inventory

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.753
that your mind might
glaze over when

00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:18.170
you look at a
financial statement,

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:24.250
inventory may be a really
key smoothing device.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.730
And at the risk of
getting carried away,

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.270
there's something called
work-in-progress inventory,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.060
and that happens when
you're using this accrual

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.950
notion of accounting
where you don't

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.010
want to subtract something
off as an expense yet.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.080
If you don't subtract
it off as an expense,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.120
then it's not on the
income statement.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.240
Well where the heck is it?

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.120
Well basically,
you act like you've

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.750
created an inventory
of something,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.880
like buying an asset.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.400
So all the fertilizer that
you've put on the land

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.500
and all of that stuff
in the accrual notion

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.010
is work-in-progress inventory,
it's producing the crop.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:07.770
Yep?

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.200
AUDIENCE: So how do you--

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.150
literally-- so how
do you kind of--

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.380
so I'm assuming
that in your survey

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.460
you ask kind of a
simpler question,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.593
like just count
assets and name--

00:22:20.593 --> 00:22:21.510
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.908
AUDIENCE: --expenses and what--

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:23.950
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Exactly.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.340
AUDIENCE: --like that.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.900
How can you be sure that
your classification kind of

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.560
is what it is and it's in
the mind of the households?

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.410
So like I understand sort of
the asset versus wealth thing

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.070
and so on, but when you go into
this like inventories and stuff

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.867
like that, how--

00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:46.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We create that.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.930
We don't ask the
household what they're

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.430
a work-in-progress inventory is.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.710
We have that as a
conceptual category

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.990
as measured from
other variables,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.242
like what did they buy,
not yet put on the land.

00:22:58.242 --> 00:23:00.810
AUDIENCE: Would you think
it's interesting to go

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.393
see whether that maps
in into some sort of--

00:23:04.393 --> 00:23:05.310
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.880
AUDIENCE: --way--

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.755
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So
Chris Woodruff had done--

00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:10.710
the inventory thing is the
hardest thing to get right.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.130
And in fact, when
you think about it,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.250
you buy maybe
inputs at one price

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.580
and you sell them in another.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.100
So you can have--

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.580
or-- so you can have
capital gains and losses

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.370
on the inventory account.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah--

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.570
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
And-- and so yeah.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.210
So what Chris has
done is actually--

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.040
he wrote a paper called--

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.320
and we take the
opposite point of view,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.140
but his is, how is
the sausage made?

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.090
Or don't ask what's
in the sausage.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.540
So he just asks households
basically what their income is,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.690
and the view there is
that somehow they're

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:57.070
going to do better than asking
all these detailed questions.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.010
We think it's better to
ask the detailed questions

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.700
and then construct the income,
but you can certainly--

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.800
and we didn't do enough of this.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.940
So yes.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:12.050
You should compare the answers
of the households to so--

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.130
and do the households have
in mind some liquidity notion

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.010
of income or do they have
in mind some sort of rate

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.010
of return calculation when you
ask them what their income is

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.480
in a given year?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.460
AUDIENCE: Maybe even
like at an earlier stage.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.280
So I think that in the
whole boredom of accounting,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.600
there is some--

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.960
what I remember as
more interesting stuff.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.840
It's like, everything that goes
on those statements you can--

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.650
it's either market
value, cost value.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.440
So there's all sorts of--

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.520
and you can get all
sorts of numbers

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.190
depending on how
you value things.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.810
So my question would be
in those in these settings

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.150
where I would
assume there's even

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.720
measurement error in
prices and everything else,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.370
like how does that
all come together?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.578
And how do you think noise--

00:25:00.578 --> 00:25:02.370
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So
I'm going to take you--

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.110
yeah.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.360
So I'll take you through
a paper we wrote.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.780
I'm going to formalize the
notion of rate of return

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.880
on assets, and
then I'll show you

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.720
one slide where we
did a lot of what--

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.550
the great virtue of
having all the data

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.370
is we could do these
experiments, say, what

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.460
if we didn't count something
we actually measured,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.497
or what if we know
change categories

00:25:24.497 --> 00:25:26.080
and put it in one
place and the other?

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.270
So actually rank-ordered
the three things

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.490
that matter most to
measuring productivity

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.170
so that we and especially
other researchers

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.420
might be able to do better.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.840
Or not have to worry about
all the details on everything,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.990
that's more to the point.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.490
Yes?

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.490
AUDIENCE: So what do you
do with households that

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.750
also are running a business?

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.866
Do you ask them only about
household inventories

00:25:48.866 --> 00:25:49.698
or the equivalent?

00:25:49.698 --> 00:25:51.740
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, we
don't separate it at all.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.210
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So we treat
it as an integrated unit.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.520
And again, my view of it is,
households don't necessarily

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.860
make that separation.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.750
So we asked them
what is the profit

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.250
from running the business?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.510
You're asking them
mentally to to separate out

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.480
all these things, to have
some money from wage earning

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.720
and so on.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.150
So we prefer to
measure everything--

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.020
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.895
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes?

00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:26.030
AUDIENCE: --quick follow-up
on [INAUDIBLE] question.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.060
In this sense in
which households

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.960
that are also a
business or just treated

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.720
as a business and
consumption decisions

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.850
are treated as a
unitary things--

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.290
really this notion of some sort
of corporate thing going on,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.800
how do you then go into--

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.010
have you thought of--

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.670
do you think it would be
interesting to like integrate

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.710
that with household
decision-making modeling that

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.570
also treats the household
as a corporate firm?

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.670
So the idea of transaction
costs within the households,

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.390
how like-- or the household then
is still a unitary thing which

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.790
maybe doesn't make much sense
because there should be--

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.953
there could be like the
woman is a manager of the--

00:27:10.953 --> 00:27:11.870
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:16.200
So there are two
things going on here.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.880
One is household non-business
activities and the other

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.180
is business activities,
and we prefer

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.150
to try to measure all of that
and have an integrated account.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.600
Now in terms of--

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.760
a household is collection
of individuals,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.925
could we do the accounting
at the individual level?

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.040
In some instances,
we're painfully aware

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.150
that this notion we have
that this group of people

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.960
is a household and is a
unit is stretching things,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.720
and yet that was our
starting point, to have

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.910
a household-level survey.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.560
For one thing, the demands
even in the measurement

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.060
of interviewing everybody
individually is horrendous.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.820
Also, you know some
assets are held jointly

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.180
or people may
disagree about who's

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.210
got the real claims on them.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.180
I mean, that said, there
are instances clearly

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:21.020
where the husband may be
hiding some of his income

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.950
or the young teenager
still living at home

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.670
actually have some earnings
in his or her bank account

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.920
and that's kind of not
commingled with the rest

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.290
of the family budget, and those
are real, real problems for us.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:36.830
Yes?

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.997
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think
to be fair to some extent,

00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:41.690
you can make that criticism of
corporate accounting as well,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.290
that maybe they're like--

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.600
they're not acting as a unit or
there are people doing things

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.245
that you can't see
in the accounts

00:28:49.245 --> 00:28:52.260
and that just looking
at a firm statement

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.260
would be different if you
would like to sit down

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.850
with every member
of a corporate firm

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.735
and ask, what did you
spend money on this month?

00:28:58.735 --> 00:29:00.360
Where did you-- all
this sort of stuff.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.260
So I feel like to some
extent, the criticisms here

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.260
are criticisms that apply to the
general framework of accounting

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.860
and not to the household
problem specifically.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.193
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, there's
is some stuff I took out,

00:29:11.193 --> 00:29:13.730
otherwise the lecture
would be even longer, which

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:18.380
is, do these problems-- you have
a conglomerate which consists

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.360
of different firms, and
there are issues there

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.260
about the flows from
one to the other.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.480
Here, you could treat a
marriage, for example,

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.680
as a merger of two firms, and
there is development literature

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.310
like that.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.950
Mark Rosenzweig
has written I think

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.400
quite convincingly on
the marriage of daughters

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.820
as basically insurance
and business transactions

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.880
and so on.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:53.120
So there are-- a divorce is
like a breakup and so on.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.240
We try to measure
liquidity, and so

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.090
it's tempting to just
have everything in cash,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.410
but actually here and in
India, grain, rice here,

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:17.180
and sorghum in India is
people borrow and lend in it,

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.890
they make commitments
to pay in it.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:23.630
So we actually have in
kind barter transactions.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.490
Now here again,
you could imagine--

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.460
and when I teach
monetary economics,

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.130
we get into this for sure.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.910
The notion of liquidity is how
quickly one could sell an asset

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.520
or is there a deep
market for it.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.420
So this is, again, both
a judgment call here

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.840
because we aggregate it
up, but also opens up

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.460
a really interesting sort of
line of research where you

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.360
can study liquidity and
transactions in these village

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.550
economies.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.870
What to do with livestock?

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.300
What does a cow--

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:07.460
a cash cow-- well, so we
just separate the asset

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.560
from the income
and expense part.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.720
So the cow is the asset.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.170
The cow, if it's young, actually
appreciates in value over time.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.410
You get a capital
gain out of it.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.400
Cattle can die prematurely,
you'll get a capital loss.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.490
We actually try to
book all those things.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.940
Meanwhile, the cow-- the
dairy cattle up in Lopburi

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.710
are delivering milk.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.590
So that's the revenue stream
off the asset, actually.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.990
It's a great analogy,
like fruit off the tree.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.030
They're not Lucas trees,
they're, I don't know,

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.120
Lopburi animals.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.910
And gifts, as I've said--

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.200
so I don't think
I'll belabor that.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.020
I spared you a lot.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.450
Just want to
introduce the concept.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.240
In the underlying
data, you'll see

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.140
a transaction, like received
wage income in cash.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.080
Now what to do with
the answer to that?

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.530
50 baht.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:18.480
Well, it enters in all three
incomes, all three statements.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.070
Basically the cash enters an
increase in the balance sheet

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.020
as an increase in
a kind of asset,

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.300
it's revenue on the
income statement,

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.440
and it's incoming cash flow
on the statement of cash flow.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.160
Not every transaction
in the data

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.110
enter on all three accounts.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.810
The struggle was
deciding indeed where

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.620
to put all of these things,
although the accounting

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.040
standards double-entry
bookkeeping does provide

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.300
a discipline-- and yes,
we made mistakes initially

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.880
and things didn't add up.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.810
So then we realized we hadn't
entered things appropriately.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.210
That's what
double-entry bookkeeping

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.580
is, some clerk having
all the transactions

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.220
and then doing the books,
quote-unquote, consists

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.300
of entering all those daily
transactions into ledgers

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.670
and creating statements.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.460
So these happened to all be
cash transactions, that's

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.070
kind of an accident,
it's just the first page

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.930
of about eight or 10
of them in the book,

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.080
and I'll skip the rest.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.560
Now let's talk about
liquidity management.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.720
Here's a statement of
cash flow, D for deficit.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.100
So you run a deficit.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.310
The deficit, say, is the
difference between your income

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.290
in a month--

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.260
cash revenue, I should say--

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:47.630
and, say, consumption--
minus consumption,

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.700
minus investment, OK?

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.410
So it's a deficit, you
had more demands for cash

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:55.855
than you received in cash.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:04.870
Well, again, by the
construction of the accounts,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.460
everything has to balance.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.480
So we know exactly how
a deficit is financed.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.960
We even try to
measure the currency.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.070
So we have F1 through Fn
are these financing devices,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.650
and then you can
do a little math,

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.969
basically, multiply
both sides by D,

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.520
but D is the sum of the F,
so basically you get this,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.370
and then you square
it, and then you

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.820
divide by the different squared,
and all of a sudden you're

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.040
looking at a variance--

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:41.810
covariance decomposition,
which is exactly true.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.360
So if you want to know the role
that a particular financing

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.409
device like F1 is playing
in terms of smoothing

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:54.790
the deficits, it's
basically like running

00:34:54.790 --> 00:35:02.440
a regression of the deficit
onto the financing device

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.780
and getting a
regression coefficient.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.070
It's really cute.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.070
That you could do it
one financing device

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.260
at a time and the sum
of those coefficients

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.330
has to add up to 1.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.390
So this isn't the only
way to talk about--

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.040
this is variance/covariance,
not order of magnitude.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.320
If you have two devices that
track each other perfectly

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.220
but there's always a
gap, this thing will say,

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.790
it's the perfect smoother,
that's the thing that's used,

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.380
but in fact, the gap remains.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.480
So you have to be a
little cautious about

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.100
the interpretation sometimes.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.810
So how do you finance?

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.380
Well you could
decrease your deposits

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.990
if you have them in a financial
institution, you could--

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.960
this is an odd way to put it--
decrease in your net ROSCA

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.390
position, which means basically
you don't want to pay in,

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.640
you want to get paid out.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.420
You want to be a recipient.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.240
You could call in your
loans, you could borrow,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.595
you could get gifts or
decrease your cash holdings.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:17.410
And for two case
study households,

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.355
we actually measure--

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:26.960
and you probably unfortunately
can't see it very well,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:33.430
but this cash is close to
100 or 1, basically, 100%.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.430
These numbers, though,
are the quartiles

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.650
of the province in which this
case study household A lives.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:47.590
So the median is 76%, this
guy's actually on the high side,

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.590
but still, in this
variance/covariance sense,

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:58.750
3/4 of the deficits is
households in Lopburi

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:03.640
are financing their
deficits with cash.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.140
Cash.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.150
They're holding
great gobs of it.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.000
Unbelievable amounts
of it in the house.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.450
And when they get
these adverse shocks

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:16.683
or they have more expenses than
inputs, it outcomes to cash.

00:37:16.683 --> 00:37:18.850
You want to say, well why
isn't-- is it in a savings

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:19.350
account?

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.470
Not much.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.190
Negligible.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.800
Now I was a little
critical of this sort

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.690
of measuring savings accounts.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.180
This is a measure
of savings account.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.340
I guess at the end
of the day, the issue

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.430
is, are they managing
their cash well?

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:39.792
This is the starting point.

00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:41.250
We have the
measurement, maybe they

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.980
should be putting
more of it in the bank

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.480
and taking it out
when they need it.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:51.450
They don't do it much, so
that is a bit of a puzzle.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.360
Gifts and loans are--

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.620
I think this is not--

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.922
this is out of the book
and not the latest version.

00:37:58.922 --> 00:38:00.130
AUDIENCE: This is the latest.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.340
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Is it?

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.190
So OK.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:12.070
So you can see these upper
quartiles are getting up

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.350
to 15%, 20%, 25%.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:21.220
So gifts are used
by some households

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.650
substantially as well.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.647
It's not just a
pure cash economy.

00:38:29.815 --> 00:38:31.440
And like-- well that's
cash management.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.970
We can talk about
asset management.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.050
It's really the same
concept, except instead

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.300
of operating on
the cash flow, you

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.310
do this accrual notion
of accounting and look

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.730
at sort of net savings.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:49.680
And I'll come back to
that later, essentially.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.570
And the portfolio management.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:55.010
So here, in answer
to the question that

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.100
was raised earlier, is
looking at something

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.690
like profits over assets,
which is a return on assets,

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:09.830
and then creating 10
different measurements of it.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.340
Do you want to exclude household
consumption of their own output

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.040
and not count it into income?

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.550
We counted total utility
expenses as a business expense,

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.560
maybe we shouldn't
have done that.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.680
Maybe it was a household
expense for, quote,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.745
consumption purposes.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.730
So service flow
from fixed assets,

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.290
which would be very natural
to do for durable goods,

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.130
we tried that.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.047
We could take income but
then add gifts and transfers

00:39:40.047 --> 00:39:41.630
even though it's
really not associated

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.960
with a project, and
especially this sort of cash.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.390
So it turned out
that this distinction

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:54.890
of cash versus accrual
was very important.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.470
The treatment of gifts
was very important.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.260
And up here, which where I
didn't start, but I could,

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.120
is in trying to get at the
cost of household labor--

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.010
own household labor
used in production,

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:13.460
that is a monster difficulty,
because you don't see for many

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.510
of them what they would have
earned as wages in someone

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.020
else's farm and so on, yet it's
clear that's very important

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.891
and it makes a very
big difference.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.970
So hopefully knowing
that, one can bend over

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:32.450
backwards to try to get a
better sense of the opportunity

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.710
cost of labor.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:39.320
So as I said, let's look
at some uses of these.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:49.540
This is a paper with Anan
on the wealth distribution,

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.340
and let's look at that 1%.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.330
Let's go get 'em.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.300
Let's get the top 1%.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.530
How much wealth does
the top 1% have?

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.810
It's huge.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:08.540
They start out in 1999 with
about 35% of the total wealth.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.430
Now it's actually diminished.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.910
This is the-- frankly,
a wonderful thing

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.190
to have all these many,
many years of data.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.110
It's diminished to 26%.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.400
What's going on is this
stuff at the bottom end

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.770
where the bottom 50%
have 5% of the wealth.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:41.900
By the way, this is typical of
the US and European history,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.230
and it's very skewed
wealth distributions.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.790
But this thing actually
doubles over the space

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.110
of about 12 years here.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.043
AUDIENCE: Is this
including cash?

00:41:55.043 --> 00:41:55.960
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.390
AUDIENCE: So it
could be like cash.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.598
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It could be.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.830
There was a question.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.320
AUDIENCE: Oh yes.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.730
Not related to this, but what
household characteristics does

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:15.463
[INAUDIBLE] economic ones like
[INAUDIBLE] household members--

00:42:15.463 --> 00:42:16.880
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, we have all

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.400
of that, all the demography.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.015
Age, education.

00:42:23.015 --> 00:42:25.000
Yeah.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.550
So in answer to your
question, we'll see what the--

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.520
that among some of
these poor people,

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.450
they have a very high return on
assets, real physical assets,

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.450
and we'll see where they're
putting their money.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.470
So inequalities going
down in some sense, right?

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.160
So anyway, this is not the
story of a poverty trap.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.020
Now I'm not claiming
this is universal truth,

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.960
I'm not claiming there
aren't poverty traps, really,

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.100
and models and in
the real world.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.600
Many countries still have--

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:08.750
like India-- vast
populations of poor people,

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:12.430
but maybe be a little leery
that at least in the case

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.190
of Thailand, you think about
starting at a low level--

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.230
and some of these guys
remain in poverty,

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:22.090
but there is a huge
growth dynamic going on.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:22.700
Yes?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.270
AUDIENCE: And how
much is the very--

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.230
in terms of the actual
distribution of income,

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.890
how much of the very
rich got surveyed?

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.877
How much-- of this--

00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:34.460
the people who got
surveyed, were they

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.080
like a top truncated
distribution,

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.168
like their very interested
and you know, the ones

00:43:38.168 --> 00:43:39.210
who answered this survey.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:40.400
It's usual--

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, it's--

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.420
well, it's a stratified
random sample.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.000
In some cases we actually
ended up with everybody

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.620
in the village, but maybe
only two out of the 16 or so

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.495
villages did that happen.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.660
I think it's more
typical that we're

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.210
worried the rich guys are
hiding some of their assets

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:07.620
rather than them not
responding at all.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.630
I could not run these
surveys on my own,

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.050
I have built up close
friendships and collaborators

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:18.000
in Thailand who are amazingly
good at getting households

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.300
to participate, and there
are occasional scares where

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.130
they think the government's
going to start taxing them,

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:28.530
the chicken farmers were making
great gobs of money in profits,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:34.650
and rumors circulated that they
better conceal their wealth.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.780
They dropped out, but we
got almost all of them

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.684
back in after a while.

00:44:39.684 --> 00:44:42.930
AUDIENCE: So I told them that
attrition is very low, but what

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.690
about the initial response rate?

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.620
What is that?

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.505
Close to 100%?

00:44:46.505 --> 00:44:48.005
Like when you
actually went in and--

00:44:48.005 --> 00:44:48.922
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:44:48.922 --> 00:44:49.680
It was very high.

00:44:53.488 --> 00:44:55.868
AUDIENCE: What do they get
for answering the survey?

00:44:55.868 --> 00:44:56.344
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Hmm?

00:44:56.344 --> 00:44:57.719
AUDIENCE: I think
Harry mentioned

00:44:57.719 --> 00:44:59.740
that people get gifts for--

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.050
AUDIENCE: No, it's
not substantial.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:03.770
It's just like you
get a new year's gift.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.470
So it's not worth the time.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.787
So they don't like look
at it from a financial--

00:45:07.787 --> 00:45:09.370
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We
give them a bottle

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.770
of fish sauce or a
blanket, or something,

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.070
and that's a Thai
sort of cultural thing

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:19.540
to establish goodwill and
that you care about a person.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.700
We just did not
and we deliberately

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.642
avoided getting into the
business of paying people.

00:45:26.642 --> 00:45:29.100
Because for one thing, then
other households in the village

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:35.910
feel like they're getting
cheated and it's just-- it's--

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.180
So this is all
voluntary participation.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.760
13 years of households
answering questions

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.515
monthly with only, whatever
it is, 2% per year dropping.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:58.030
So here is-- there's a
movie called Falling Down--

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.390
I don't even remember
that guy went berserko

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.380
with a machine gun.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.240
I always think of that.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.720
So not everybody's
wealth is going up,

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.750
and in fact, some
people actually

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.780
find their wealth is falling.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.540
So we can track
their net position

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.930
in the distribution of
wealth, and here, you

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.980
can see these
people climbing up,

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.980
and other people,
quote, falling down.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.400
This is the histogram of
sort of in percentiles.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.460
By the way, the average
has to be 0 because it's--

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.290
the net change is 0
over all the households,

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:49.220
but you can see
some substantial--

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.886
1 standard deviation is
like 14 percentage points.

00:46:52.886 --> 00:46:57.473
AUDIENCE: So do you have any
[INAUDIBLE] falling down?

00:46:57.473 --> 00:46:58.390
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:02.990
So I guess one thing that sort
of got lost in the shuffle

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:08.060
because we didn't decide
clearly whether it would show

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.150
within the TA session or
I would show it here is

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:13.400
kind of a life cycle picture.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:19.090
So we've created
by cohorts, by age.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:23.250
And you can see, especially
in the areas near Bangkok,

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.980
a classic life cycle.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.410
So as these
households are young,

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:33.280
they start to accumulate
wealth, but after a while,

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.990
especially as their
income falls off,

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:36.680
they start running
down their assets.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.440
So this does not
distinguish by age.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.820
So it's a bit misleading,
it's not like there's some--

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.240
necessarily some young household
that's just consistently eating

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.090
more than their income.

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:53.100
There are households like that,
and that raises this issue

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.350
before of what's going on.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:59.910
I mean, if the husband
isn't there, for example,

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.030
and the wife is running
some hair salon,

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.110
she's consistently eating more
than then the household income,

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:11.200
but you kind of wonder if
there isn't something going on,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.080
and we just don't
have the husband there

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.430
who chooses either for
personal or occupation reasons

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.790
to be in Bangkok the whole time.

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:25.300
So then we get a
misleading picture

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:34.020
that she may be in trouble or
she may know more the future

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:34.620
than we do.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:41.750
So let's do a simple
decomposition.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.660
Here's savings.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.220
Savings on both sides
in absolute amount.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.860
And then divide and
multiply by profits

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.470
from the household and
businesses, all of them

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:57.040
summed up, and divide
and multiply by assets.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.200
So that has to be true.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.520
It's an identity.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:05.830
But savings over
basically profits

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:10.810
is a savings rate out of
income, and profits over assets

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:14.800
is the return on
assets post-multiplied

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.510
by the level of assets.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:22.600
So basically you can look at--

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:41.010
you can look at the
change in wealth

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:45.440
or the percentage change in
wealth, and wealth comes--

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.100
where is a change in
wealth coming from?

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.170
It's coming from savings
plus income and gifts.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.450
The savings thing is
decomposed up here.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.370
So part of the mechanical
accounting drivers

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:03.990
of increasing wealth has
to do with savings rates

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:09.550
and rates of return on assets.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.080
And maybe gifts if
they're important.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.630
So here is the
correlation of the growth

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:21.903
of net worth with savings
rates, and depending

00:50:21.903 --> 00:50:23.320
on whether the
unit of observation

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.770
is household month or household
year or households averaged up

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:30.010
over all of the months
and years of the data,

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:36.940
you do see some positive
significant correlations.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.390
So in fact, not
too surprisingly,

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:43.450
some of the increase
in net worth

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:48.580
is coming from households
who have high savings rates.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:54.740
But the bigger part of the
story is the correlation

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.620
with the return on assets.

00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.420
And there, it's consistent
pretty much at all levels.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:10.030
So household by household
with our measurement,

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:13.930
we look at their productivity
in terms of rate of return,

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.720
and then see whether their net
wealth is going up or down,

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.650
and it's the households who
have high rates of return who

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:22.420
have the high--

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.810
highest rates of increase
in their net worth.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.620
And it's quite persistent.

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:35.820
Here, we look at return on
assets in the first half

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:40.830
and second half of the sample
at the time that we did it.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:46.350
So if they were identical, they
would lie on a 45-degree line,

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:50.670
and these scatter points are
close with one exception, which

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:53.802
is Buriram.

00:51:53.802 --> 00:51:55.930
Oh, you should be thinking
models at this point.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:52:01.110
Remember the productivity,
the TFP thing?

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.975
That's the thing sitting outside
multiplicatively in front

00:52:03.975 --> 00:52:05.100
of the production function?

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.730
These are household-specific
TFP numbers sort of.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.280
It's not a very sophisticated--
production function

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.930
is just linear.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:15.890
So it's not really just--

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:19.080
you'd rather have like the
marginal product of capital

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.160
and pre-multiply, this is a
linear production function.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.770
The marginal product
is just the average.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:28.840
But it's very persistent.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:34.300
So in these models, the issue
is, are those TFP shocks IID

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.070
over households,
are they the same

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:38.190
unless you get blasted
with some shock?

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:42.010
And this suggests that
the household level

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:43.950
it's really quite persistent.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:50.690
Buriram is an
interesting exception,

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:52.760
and I'll just say
it in words, there

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.020
are many more occupations
shifts in Buriram

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.390
than in the other
three provinces.

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:03.870
It turns out these villages
aren't really villages anymore,

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.350
they've paved over our
soil moisture readers

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:09.350
and they become
part of the town.

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.720
There's a big construction
boom going on.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.540
Part of that is
pararubber, part of it

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.580
is Scandinavian tourists
coming in marrying Thai women

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.282
and staying.

00:53:23.282 --> 00:53:26.990
The place is just like
a construction boom.

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:30.320
So people shifted
from rice-growing

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.780
or money-lending or
other things to laying

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.420
tile and all these
things, and they

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.310
had a higher return
on their assets

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:40.700
as a result on average
of those switches.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.120
So that's kind of reassuring.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.360
It's another sense
in which households

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.960
are aware of their success.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.560
And here, coming back
to Witt's question,

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.600
if you partition
into low, medium,

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.510
and high return on
assets and looked

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:01.850
at what they did with
their increasing wealth,

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:08.050
these high ROA guys are putting
money back in the business.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.460
They're buying equipment,
they're investing and putting

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.940
it into their business.

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:16.100
And that's not true of
the medium or low guys.

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.120
These guys are doing
the financial assets.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.680
So more of their
increasing financial wealth

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:27.440
is potentially in cash, but to
the extent that we measured ROA

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.390
accurately, which
we have tried very

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:32.120
hard to do in all kinds of
different ways, we're getting

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.240
the reinforcing message
here that we've measured it

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.775
accurately because they seem
to do what you would think,

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:41.150
which is, you're not going to
put your money in a savings

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:45.150
account when you've got
a really high return.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.910
And later in another lecture
will try to adjust for risk.

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:57.380
So now we'll aggregate
it up to villages

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.090
and use those same
financial accounts.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.260
We do have to struggle
again with this dual role

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.210
that households play as
consumers and producers.

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:14.140
So much of economics
is driven by here

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.690
is firms maximizing profits,
here is households maximizing

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.820
utility-- these are
households running businesses,

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.660
so what are we going to do?

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.590
And in particular, what are
we going to do with the labor?

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.910
Well, we made a decision,
although here, we do

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.180
check and do robustness checks.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.320
And what I'm going
to show you today

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.500
is treating even the
labor income as something

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:42.620
like consulting income, like
they're providing a service--

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.110
their business is
to provide a labor

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:48.440
service to other households,
and they get profits from that.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.420
Now if you think about a
production sector and aggregate

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:03.850
up, to the extent that inputs
from one business are--

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:06.310
the outputs from one business
are an input to the other,

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.620
the net is zero and
it doesn't count.

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.220
But in these villages,
the output of one business

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.760
could be someone
else's consumption,

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.200
and it doesn't net out.

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.030
Both get measured.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.580
As it would if you're
distinguishing households

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.190
from firms.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.940
We can actually measure and
ask about the transactions.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:32.750
So we know the transaction
partners almost.

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:36.050
We did screw up with
consumption because we

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.150
forgot to ask
consistently where they

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:42.230
buy stuff, which has to do with
the price thing also mentioned

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:43.730
earlier.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.680
But fortunately,
and I'm sure you'll

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.260
be more than happy to
take my word for it,

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:52.550
there is an accounting identity,
so you can kind of back up

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:57.770
as a residual how much of
that output is basically

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:01.850
sold and consumed in the village
because we measured everything

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:03.300
else.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.197
In other words, on
the buying side,

00:57:05.197 --> 00:57:07.780
we don't see it, but-- because
we don't know where they bought

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.210
it, but we actually figured
out on the selling side

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:12.965
that it came from somebody who
produced it in the village.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.740
Measurement error,
you asked-- somebody

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:25.070
asked about the rich
guys not participating.

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:28.730
If a moneylender were
like the central node

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:32.690
and the money lender refused
to answer our questions,

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:34.190
we're going to get
really screwed up

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:38.127
in terms of the flow of funds
and the balance of payments

00:57:38.127 --> 00:57:38.960
and everything else.

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.600
Because we are going to act
like the average overall--

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.260
the households in the
village is the representation

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:49.397
of what's going on in the
village itself as a whole.

00:57:49.397 --> 00:57:51.230
To the extent that
there's measurement error

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:53.935
but there is IID
over households,

00:57:53.935 --> 00:57:56.060
and to the extent that we
have a lot of households,

00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.120
then hopefully that
helps make the case

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.750
that we've got a
reasonably good measure.

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:14.225
So how do you create
these accounts?

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:20.035
What is GNP anyway?

00:58:20.035 --> 00:58:20.535
GDP?

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.674
Everyone seems to be
obsessed about it.

00:58:26.674 --> 00:58:31.180
OK, it just comes from
the income statement.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.660
So basically, here's
a statement of income,

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.340
it's what you would expect.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:39.000
You've got revenues come from
production, or for that matter,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.390
if you're a lender or
saver from interest,

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.620
you've got capital gains.

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.230
You subtract off
capital losses, maybe

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:51.870
you have sort of a paid payment
from an insurance indemnity.

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:54.900
So those are revenues,
here is basically expenses,

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.940
production expenses,
interest expenses

00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:01.910
on loans, depreciation,
insurance premia, taxes, et

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:02.440
cetera.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:10.960
So net income before tax--

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.920
before income tax but
after property tax

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.350
is what makes these things
balance because this

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:17.610
is basically the profit--

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:21.920
it's basically
revenues less expenses.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.060
So that should be
comfortable, sound sort of

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.310
reassuringly familiar.

00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:33.740
All that we do is
basically take this stuff

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:36.440
and subtract it off
from both sides.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.420
That cancels it out
on the right-hand side

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.160
and puts it on the
left-hand side.

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:46.970
So basically you have production
revenue less production

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:59.070
expenses, and that's
basically the rest

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:02.470
is equal to the payments
to factors of production.

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:05.220
So you're paying
stuff out in interest,

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:11.230
you're paying out in taxes,
depreciation is over here,

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:14.940
and you're paying out to
the owners of the enterprise

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.250
namely profits.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.430
So you may remember
vaguely that there's

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:24.810
two ways to measure
income on the output side

01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:28.140
and on the factor payment side,
and they add up to each other.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:33.240
So this is
value-added, basically.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.170
The only catch here is
the way we treated labor,

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:40.080
you don't see a labor
expense over here,

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.330
because normally
value-added, you're

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.810
only subtracting off
intermediate inputs

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:48.720
and other purchased inputs,
but here, we actually subtract

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.820
off the labor because of
the way we conceptualize

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:59.200
that problem or that issue.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.150
So you want to see what's
happening over time in the four

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:09.400
provinces, four villages
per province, Chachoengsao

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:17.080
GDP or really village product is
going down pretty consistently.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.080
Now what happened is the
shrimp ponds, basically,

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.970
people had
converted-- yeah, that

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.160
stuff you're buying
in Costco or Walmart,

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.660
those are typically Thai shrimp.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.390
But the ponds-- so
there's some disease.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:38.010
And so-- and household,
some of them switched.

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:41.180
And the fish and others
now are actually,

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.670
with the world grain prices
being relatively high,

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:49.027
they're refilling in the
ponds and planting rice again.

01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:49.610
AUDIENCE: Rob?

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:50.050
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes?

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:52.370
AUDIENCE: What are the different
colored lines [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.580
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Each
of four villages.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:53.930
So--

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:54.763
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:01:54.763 --> 01:01:56.740
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.560
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So you
can see, is every village

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.640
like every other village?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.550
Well, to some degree, yes,
but the levels are different,

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:09.460
and sometimes even the movements
over time are a bit different.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.620
Another thing to watch
out for is the scale here,

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:16.450
because in order to clearly
display each village--

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:18.910
each of the four villages in
a province, where changing

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:20.570
the scale of a province.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.920
Sisaket is a lot poorer than--

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.760
even in their worst days,
Chachoengsao villages

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:38.060
are better off
substantially than Sisaket.

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:42.500
So the income levels
are maybe on average

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.400
three times higher
in Chachoengsao.

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:52.200
They're almost ordered by
their distance to Bangkok.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.440
I won't bore you with this.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.130
This is just to
what do households

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:59.375
do with their profits?

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:04.410
And then the story is mostly
in the northeast. they eat it.

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:08.010
And in central region, they're
more likely to put it back

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:12.750
in the business or their
farm as retained earnings.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:19.250
Savings investment
account, that's

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.540
probably worth looking at.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.010
Here's the balance sheet.

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:26.940
So remember, we had assets
and liabilities and net worth.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:31.190
This is the change over
time in the balance sheet.

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:34.710
So it's like a
first-time difference.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:40.960
So changes in liabilities
and changes in net worth

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.060
must equal to the change
in all the assets,

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.880
especially if you include
change in net worth over there.

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:55.270
These could be
financial or real.

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:58.770
Well hopefully this is
comfortable and familiar.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:01.830
Just the notion of having assets
and liabilities and net worth

01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:04.170
and taking a time difference.

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:07.310
What is the savings
investment account?

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:10.970
Well, you just basically take
the change in liabilities

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:14.420
and put it on the
left-hand side.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.870
That leaves the change in net
worth on the right-hand side,

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:21.800
and then what you do with
it on the left-hand side.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.580
Yes?

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.660
AUDIENCE: So before we were
talking about household gifts

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.395
equity.

01:04:28.395 --> 01:04:29.270
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep.

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.978
AUDIENCE: So does that
mean that they get

01:04:30.978 --> 01:04:32.380
counted as financial assets?

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.613
Where would gifts
in a village enter?

01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:40.155
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Contributed capital.

01:04:40.155 --> 01:04:41.270
AUDIENCE: Contributed capital.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.720
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.127
That's what we called it.

01:04:43.127 --> 01:04:43.544
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:04:43.544 --> 01:04:43.961
Cool.

01:04:43.961 --> 01:04:44.380
Thanks.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.140
I'm sorry, it just occurred to--

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:45.980
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
No, no, it's fine.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.070
AUDIENCE: --no idea
where they're going.

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.237
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, yeah.

01:04:48.237 --> 01:04:51.018
It's there, because if
they're getting gifts and not

01:04:51.018 --> 01:04:53.060
eating too much, it should
increase their wealth,

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.640
and therefore, it should show
up somewhere as either reduced

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.640
debt or increased assets.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:04.850
And that phenomenon depends
a lot on where you are.

01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:07.210
AUDIENCE: But entered
both sides, right?

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:10.762
It entered as increased cash,
and then also increased--

01:05:10.762 --> 01:05:11.720
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well--

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.560
AUDIENCE: --contributed capital.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.102
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
The concept is here.

01:05:14.102 --> 01:05:16.610
So basically say
this is positive,

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:20.550
and your change in
net worth is positive

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.760
because either retained
earnings or contributed capital.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.920
And then the issue is
portfolio management,

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.900
it's what did you do with it?

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.260
And you could put it in cash,
that's in financial assets,

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:38.580
but you could also have it in
inventory as I was alluding to,

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.990
or have livestock assets
or other fixed assets.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.180
So it's worthy of
study to figure out

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.268
what they're doing with it.

01:05:48.268 --> 01:05:49.726
AUDIENCE: And
sometimes the idea is

01:05:49.726 --> 01:05:51.730
there's a reciprocity,
and the gift that I

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.690
give to my buddy in
the next village is

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.840
in some sense a residual--

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:57.757
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:05:57.757 --> 01:05:58.690
AUDIENCE: So yeah.

01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:58.930
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.290
AUDIENCE: So yea, I
guess that's what--

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.690
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I mean,
the extreme versions of that

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.030
would be the kids
that go off to Bangkok

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.150
and they send money back.

01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:08.110
Now can you distinguish
they're just

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:09.640
caring about their parents?

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:14.500
And there's a very strong
Thai tradition there.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.010
But then eventually they
come back and run the farm.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:27.080
But it is-- it's a
real incoming flow,

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.060
so we have to do
something with it.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.297
We could just not call
it equity or something,

01:06:32.297 --> 01:06:34.130
and in effect, that's
what we're doing here,

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:39.510
is just keeping track of it
separately as a line item.

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:40.010
OK.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:47.300
So I guess I said this before.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.480
Oh, by the way, on the
lifecycle diagrams,

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.350
it's really dramatic
that in the northeast,

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:59.890
wealth isn't dropping
as these guys get older,

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.780
and likewise, they're
not accumulating

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.800
a lot of financial or real
assets as they're young

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.540
and getting older either.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.970
There doesn't seem to
be this life cycle,

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:12.470
and the gifts just
get bigger and bigger.

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:15.910
You don't have to get
older to get those gifts.

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:16.840
It's the huge--

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.940
I think it's overlapping
generations, essentially.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.440
It's really quite different
between the northeast

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.000
and the central area,
and that's related,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.585
because it's kind
of showing up here.

01:07:30.585 --> 01:07:32.335
So then we get to the
balance of payments.

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:44.420
So basically, villages trade.

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:47.480
They produce stuff and
sell it and they buy stuff

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.040
as inputs and by consumption.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:54.260
So we got sort of a trade
balance that we measure.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:59.180
You could add in interest
earnings from, quote, abroad,

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.520
but it's really mostly
from the same country.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.440
They're getting interest
on savings accounts

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.410
that they held outside the
village or in those gifts

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:07.910
again.

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:14.740
So you may or may
not have seen this,

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.080
this gets really
kind of confusing

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.140
the way the standard
accounting is done.

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:26.410
Trade balance plus this other
earnings on gifts and interest

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:28.870
is called the current
account, and then you

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:31.990
have the current
account balanced

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:35.109
with the financial count
and the capital account.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.970
But they didn't
write current account

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:42.490
equal financial account,
so this stuff has

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:48.609
to be-- if you're trading
a lot, like China,

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:51.640
and you have a big sort
of current account,

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.569
this stuff has to be negative.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:56.660
A negative in the
financial account

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.710
is actually, quote, a
good thing in the sense

01:08:58.710 --> 01:09:03.050
that you're accumulating assets.

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:06.270
But believe me, it'll
throw you every time when

01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:09.330
you start thinking about it.

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:12.210
And then I won't
drive this for you,

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.700
but it turns out that
if you take this sort

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:19.109
of Keynesian-looking
thing, which is really just

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:23.340
an accounting statement,
income less consumption less

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:27.029
investment plus transfers--
that's not taxes--

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:32.340
has to be identically
equal to the trade balance

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.220
plus sort of capital
account balance, which

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.069
we keep track of separately,
plus the change in inventories.

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:44.430
So largely, if they
run an export surplus,

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.064
they're going to save
it, but not quite.

01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:48.689
Because they have
other ways of saving,

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.569
you have to adjust for
changes in the capital,

01:09:51.569 --> 01:09:54.990
buying and selling with
foreigners, so to speak,

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.490
and the changes in inventory.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.424
AUDIENCE: So the left-hand
side is a financial account

01:09:59.424 --> 01:10:01.325
in this case?

01:10:01.325 --> 01:10:02.700
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
It's not obvious

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.750
how you get from this to this.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:10.250
And I decided not to
try to derive it today.

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.050
But it is an identity.

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.370
One follows from the other.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.970
And here, the
balance of payments

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:24.220
accounts for these
villages, mostly

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.440
this story is they're
running surpluses.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.410
The trade or trade and
current account is this blue

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:34.860
or blue-red stuff, and--

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.720
although here you
see a difference.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.680
Chachoengsao's
getting in trouble,

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.530
its balance of payments
is going down in the sense

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:47.640
that it's running less
and less of a surplus.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.140
Whereas Lopburi is
the other story.

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.480
It's always increasing.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.330
The difference
between red and blue

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:59.700
is basically the gifts that play
a big role in the northeast.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.180
And here's an instance
of Buriram coming off

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:08.040
the financial crisis,
which was 1997-98,

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.640
but anyway, they actually ran
a balance of payments deficit.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.860
So this opens up the whole
vista of international economics

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.200
and what's going on
using those kinds of ways

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.660
of conceptualizing the problem.

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:33.980
And just to remind you, because
I promised an application

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:37.520
for each section, we've
had tons of models

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:43.160
of the role of financing
constraints or other obstacles

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.980
in growth and TFP and
so on and so forth.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:56.310
So here's just some model with
arch where we do the following.

01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:00.070
We take these villages to
be small open economies,

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:03.010
we see a drop in
the interest rate--

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:06.470
it's actually true worldwide--

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:10.940
and we see the
number of new loans

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:15.590
increasing this has to do in
part with this village fund

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:19.430
stuff that we'll talk about
later the Million Baht

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:20.240
Fund in Thailand.

01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:26.750
This is the collateral
constraint--

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:29.500
this is a model thing.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:34.110
So we're going to act as if that
innovation associated with more

01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:37.590
loans was like a weakening
of the borrowing constraint

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:46.270
and feed it into
a model, and it's

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:51.680
a trade model with
financial underpinnings,

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.940
and it predicts things like the
relative price of agriculture

01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.340
relative to manufactured goods.

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:03.240
In the model and in the
data, we're kind of close.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:09.120
And a real goal was to try
to get the wages right,

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.785
and here is the actual and
model-driven real wages.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.870
Why is this a struggle?

01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:21.030
If you think about
Heckscher-Ohlin,

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:24.600
that has to do with
the area around Bangkok

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.070
being very capital-intensive
and not having so much labor,

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:33.120
so interest rates are
lower and wages are higher;

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.290
in the northeast, it's the
other way around because capital

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.500
and wealth is relatively low.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.110
So you think that
over time you're

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.750
going to get
convergence, which means

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:46.710
wages ought to be dropping
in the central area,

01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:49.120
and they're not.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.070
So then you introduce
this financial constraint,

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:55.350
and you get the
dynamics that have

01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:57.550
to do with choosing
occupations and so on.

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:01.170
So that hopefully you remember
enough from the other papers

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:06.030
that we covered to kind of
imagine how one would fill this

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:09.570
out, and we're actually at
these calibrated values--

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.720
we're actually
matching quite well

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:20.050
all the income shares for wages,
manufacturing, and agriculture.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.230
Yep?

01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:25.700
AUDIENCE: I might
remember wrong, but just--

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.520
yeah, it's very likely,
but in your paper

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.157
with Kaboski on the Million--

01:14:32.157 --> 01:14:33.490
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Baht Fund, yes.

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:38.180
AUDIENCE: Is it
the interest rate

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:44.510
wasn't going to be with
the intervention, was it?

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:47.160
Now you just said that
the interest rate drop has

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.410
to do with the Million Baht--

01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:51.460
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Remember, what we're doing

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.760
is kind of a variation
in the cross-section

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.610
as a function of the percentage
of households in the village.

01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:02.510
So the per-capita
treatment is we're

01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:05.310
seeing whether that has any
impact on the interest rate.

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:08.230
What I showed you was the time
variation in the interest rate,

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.660
so it's a very different object.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.310
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:11.227
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:15:11.227 --> 01:15:13.830
So that's kind of like
differenced out, basically.

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:18.095
It's the relative
difference from the trend

01:15:18.095 --> 01:15:19.470
and whether the
Million Baht Fund

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:20.637
had something to do with it.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:23.760
OK.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.240
The last thing is flow of funds.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.270
These are the flow of funds
accounts for Thailand,

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:31.080
basically.

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:37.180
A quick introduction
to flow of funds,

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.240
you've got non-financial
corporations,

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.650
financial corporations,
government, households,

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:47.620
and not-for-profit corporations,
and the rest of the world.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.320
Those are the sectors.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.640
And then you have
acquisition of assets,

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.870
and they're actually in
detailed financial accounts.

01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:00.370
When the flow of funds
accounts-- when they exist,

01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:03.330
you've got money and
gold and currency,

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:06.130
securities, loans, and so on.

01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:10.500
So acquiring a loan means
basically you're a lender.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.800
On the other hand, you've
got sort of liabilities

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.890
down here, and so that you can
have a loan which represents

01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:19.140
an increase in borrowing.

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.560
It takes a lot of concentration
to constantly remember

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.500
uses means putting money--

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.000
so the idea is you run--

01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:34.630
you have positive savings,
where do you put your money?

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:36.640
And you could put it
here or you could reduce

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.700
your deficits, or if you--

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.720
reduce your liabilities.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.362
If you run it the
other way and you

01:16:42.362 --> 01:16:43.820
have negative
savings or something,

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.820
and then you've got to
increase your liabilities

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.880
or run down and sell off
some assets that you own.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.980
These are the
traditional labor labels

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.075
in the flow of funds by sector.

01:16:58.150 --> 01:16:59.980
Is there a relationship
between flow

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.080
of funds and the
national income accounts?

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.250
Yes.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:06.460
Actually, in principle,
they should all

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:09.280
be consistent with one another.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.740
But they're often not.

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:15.010
The thing that is most
consistent is flow of funds

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:18.010
into and out of the
financial institutions

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:21.880
because commercial banks and
other financial corporations

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.370
are required to
report to regulators,

01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:26.990
and the central bank
keeps track of things.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:31.480
So we see most accurately
deposits coming in,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.720
loans going out for
financial corporations.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.230
We often see little or
anything of the transactions

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:41.170
between the other sectors.

01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:42.970
There are national
income and product

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:48.880
account for those sectors,
and we see, therefore, savings

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.660
for those, but those
savings numbers

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:56.470
are often radically
different from the savings

01:17:56.470 --> 01:18:00.640
we would impute from
just seeing transactions

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.190
with the measured
formal financial sector.

01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:05.620
Another way to say
this, if you read Deaton

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:12.100
and so on, the savings you see
coming from household surveys

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.860
gives you very, very different
numbers than the savings

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:18.310
you'll see at the level of
the national income accounts,

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:21.220
and that's because the
measurement is missing,

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:26.030
so households get treated as the
residual in the national income

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.530
accounts.

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:35.990
But flow of funds data do
exist, and to some extent,

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:40.820
they can be created, and
Thailand is, for example--

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:46.310
and Mexico-- creating improved
financial flow of funds

01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:48.080
accounts.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.210
I'd like to think we had
something to do with that.

01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:55.880
We can also do it at
the village level.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:01.160
I've shown you a lot, but
let me just jump here.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.860
At the national
aggregate level, these

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.220
are the traditional sectors,
and here's a diamond,

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:15.890
and basically you can see
from the standpoint of banks,

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:19.990
households are
interior-- basically

01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:22.010
households are
investing in banks,

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.400
but that's a liability
for the banking sector.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.300
Savings accounts
are to be paid back.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.620
On the other hand, in this
period between '08 and--

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:37.090
'04 and '08, you know the
banking sector was investing

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:39.610
in the rest of the world and
that had to do with Thailand

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:41.965
running a balance
of payments surplus.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.160
But this is at
the village level.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.200
And here, you can distinguish
financial corporations,

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.680
transactions with businesses
outside the village,

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.230
transactions of the village
funds we just talked about,

01:19:57.230 --> 01:20:01.310
and you can see them using
currency, running surpluses

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:04.460
or deficits with these
other entities in terms

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.020
of the objects.

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:10.010
So the point here is that
it's a common way of measuring

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:14.120
and it doesn't just have to be
applied as it is conventionally

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.650
at the national level.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:19.430
Flow of funds can zoom
in and zoom out by region

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:23.040
and tell you which object's
moving around over time.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:32.240
And in fact, you can read
it in a little more leisure

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.460
style on your own, there's
papers of Guerrieri and Guido

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:42.470
Lorenzoni and Monika Piazzesi
and Martin Schneider,

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:46.160
and these are,
granted, about the US,

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.910
but it's basically looking
at the household sector

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.100
and going to the flow
of funds data in the US

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:58.550
to measure changes in
savings and borrowing.

01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:01.400
And this same
language that they use

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.890
to try to understand
what happens

01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:07.310
in a financial crisis
when all of a sudden you

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:11.690
can't borrow as much
because the banks are tight,

01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:15.300
or in Monika's case, what
happens when there are many,

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.080
many more young people
entering and they have

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.860
certain expectations
about inflation,

01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:25.080
and each one of these
pairs of authors

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.460
is doing this kind of experiment
in the context of a model.

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:32.430
So these very same
models that rely

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:35.370
on a sort of macro-aggregate
looking, though,

01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:40.500
at sectors in the US also
apply to developing countries.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.250
In fact Guido's model is eerily
similar, although none of us

01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:47.610
recognized it at the time, to
the model that Joe and I used

01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:52.730
to analyze the village
fund in in Thailand.

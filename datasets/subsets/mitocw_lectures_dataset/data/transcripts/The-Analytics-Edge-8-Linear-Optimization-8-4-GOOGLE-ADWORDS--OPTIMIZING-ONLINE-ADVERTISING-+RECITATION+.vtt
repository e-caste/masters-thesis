00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.900
Welcome to the linear
optimization recitation.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.020
My name is Velibor, and I'll
be guiding you through it.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.010
This week, we'll learn
the core techniques

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.030
in applying linear optimization.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.270
We'll learn how to model a
problem, how to solve it,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.480
how to compare the solution
to alternative solutions,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.680
and how to perform sensitivity
analysis using the model.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.140
The problem we will use to
guide this whole process

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.580
will be the online
advertising allocation problem

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.080
that is at the heart of
Google's online advertising

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.610
system, which is also
known as AdWords.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.860
Whenever you're ready, let's
move on to the next video

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.640
and get started.

MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20 Special Relativity.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.770
In this section, we're going
to talk about the emission

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.020
and the absorption of photons.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.460
So you can think
about a scenario

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.010
where you have an atom
which emits a photon,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.230
like in this picture here.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.120
And to create a new atom,
which we call the atom prime,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.580
in the absorption process,
you have a collision

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.380
between a photon and the atom.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.940
And you make a new atom,
again, indicated by a prime.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.210
So I want you to actually work
this out in two activities.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.340
The first one is on absorption.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.870
So here we have a stationary
particle, the atom,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.470
with a mass M0, and
it's struck by a photon.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.810
We have this scenario here.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.970
And the photon has an
energy, Q, and becomes--

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.560
and there's a new particle
coming out with the rest mass

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.090
M0 prime and
recoiling velocity, it

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.560
has to have some
sort of momentum,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.750
v. And so the question
is, how can we

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.470
now find the mass of this new
particle and the velocity?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.050
So please stop the video,
and try to work this out.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.890
So the way to work this out is
by writing energy and momentum

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.390
equation.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.475
You can do this just
with a four-vector.

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.350
even though we are not
performing any Lorentz

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.058
transformation in this
part, you can just

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:30.380
write on the four-vector.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.750
And this needs to
be conserved energy.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.440
And momentum need to be
conserved in this correlation.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.755
All right, so we have the
mass of this initial particle

00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:42.090
at rest.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780
So the energy is M 0 C square.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.245
The energy of the photon is
Q. The momentum of the photon

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.120
is Q over c.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.050
And so then the final particle--
the outcoming new particle

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.090
has its own mass,
but it has a boost.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.850
So the total energy is M 0
prime gamma using the velocity

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.770
of this particle, C square.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.530
And the momentum is M 0
prime gamma times v. So

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.278
that's after the correlation.

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:13.070
And so then you can
use the energy relation

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.080
in order to get to the mass.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.150
This is a function
of the velocity here.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.620
And you can get the velocity
by looking at the momentum.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.400
So you basically solve for this
v or v over c in this case.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.830
And then if you want, you
can add this back in here

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.675
in order to get the
mass as a function

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:34.550
of the mass of the
initial particle

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.230
and the energy of the photon.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.130
The second example
now is the emission.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.370
So here we have a stationary
atom with a rest mass M0.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.580
And it emits the
photon, this energy Q.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.410
And it becomes the new
atom with rest mass

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.810
M0 prime and recoiling
with the velocity.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.080
Now given the two masses, what
is the energy of the photon?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.100
Q.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.570
So we set this up in
the same way as before.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.260
Now we start with
this particle at rest.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.320
And the energy is M 0 c squared.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.730
Momentum is 0.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.400
And that's equal to
the energy and momentum

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.210
of the new particle and the
photon, in the very same way

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.710
as we set this up before.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.650
So now what you
want to do here is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.990
use our invariants of the
four-vector using the energy

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.180
and momentum relation.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.820
So the mass of this new particle
times c square squared is equal

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.160
to the energy squared .

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.400
The energy squared-- you
just bring this over here--

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.250
is M0 c squared minus Q squared.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.270
And then the momentum is
simply of this new particle,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.220
is simply Q square.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.920
This you cannot solve for Q.
And you find this relation here.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.380
So that's the energy
of the outgoing photon.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.640
If you now define Q0 as
the difference in masses

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.570
or the difference of the
masses times c square,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.329
then you can write the
energy of the photon

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.190
as Q0 times 1 minus
Q0 over 2M c square.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.310
And that's always smaller
than the difference in masses.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.310
So if you now analyze this
and look at this some more

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.930
and try to understand
what it means,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.230
what we find is that the
emission and the absorption,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.185
they only occur at
a very precise value

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.510
of the energy of the photon.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.910
It also means that an
emitted photon can only

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.000
be reabsorbed if the
particles are moving

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.760
with just the right velocity.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.460
So if you're an atom,
and the photon goes out,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.920
and your neighboring atom is
just sitting there next to you

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.530
at rest as you were at
rest before, it is not

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.560
able to reabsorb the photon.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.580
So we learned just by using
special relativity quite a bit

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.650
about the physics
involved in absorption

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.920
and emission of photons.

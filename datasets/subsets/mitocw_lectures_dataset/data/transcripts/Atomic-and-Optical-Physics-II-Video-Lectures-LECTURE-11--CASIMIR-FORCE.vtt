00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.000
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.440
Welcome to April fool's day.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.409
But we'll be serious
about atomic physics.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.540
I hope you enjoyed
your spring break.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.380
At least I did.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.530
It's just a little
bit change of pace.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.410
So let me remind you what
we have been discussing.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.550
We have been talking
about interactions

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.930
between neutral atoms.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.320
And that can be trivial
and very profound.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.360
Trivial because you've heard
about van der Waal's forces.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.060
Polarization forces
between neutral atoms.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.519
And if you describe
them phenomenologically,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.730
you just have 1 over r to
the 6 or whatever power

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.740
of an interaction.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.980
On the other hand, if
you take the position

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.780
that everything which happens
between neutral objects

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.240
has to be mediated, has to be
created by the photon field,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.030
then it becomes a question of
the vacuum, the vacuum which

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.350
surrounds the two neutral atoms.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.800
And I've tried in this
chapter to show you

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.298
both sides, to similar or
the same physics from two

00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:41.256
different perspectives.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.540
We talked mainly about the
van der Waal's interaction

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.590
between two neutral atoms.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.890
I don't want one to-- we
pretty much finished it,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.530
so I just give
you a bird's view.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.640
I don't really repeat
a lot of things.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.910
Because today we want to
talk about the forces which

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.950
happen between neutral atoms in
metal plates and then two metal

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.639
plates, which is
the Casimir force.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.720
But just to remind
you that we showed

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.450
that the forces
between neutral objects

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.150
are actually created by
quantum fluctuations.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.580
Classical objects would not
create fluctuating dipole

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.540
moments, would
therefore not create--

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.060
would not give rise to any
force between neutral atoms.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.340
And I showed you that
there are two aspects where

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.380
quantum physics comes in,
namely through the fluctuations

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.070
or the zero point motion of
the atoms as oscillators.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.870
And we even had a
circuit model for that.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.700
But then I also said
that, well, assume

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.750
that you have two
neutral atoms and you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.080
have the vacuum
fluctuations of the field.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.200
This vacuum
fluctuation is driving

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.210
coordinated synchronized dipole
moments between the two atoms,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.640
and then the two atoms
can attract each other.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.620
So we have seen the dual role
which quantum physics plays

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.820
here in terms of
quantum fluctuations

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.550
of the atomic
oscillators and quantum

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.150
fluctuation of the
electromagnetic field, which

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.880
is another harmonic oscillator.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.790
And at least when I use
very simple pictures,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.360
it seemed that the 1 over
r to the six potential,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.560
the standard van der Waal's
potential at short range,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.000
comes from the vacuum-- from the
fluctuations of the oscillator.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.540
I didn't do the derivation,
but the simplest derivation

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.635
for the long range Casimir
Polder retarded potential,

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:54.150
1 over r to the 7, focused
on the fluctuations

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.620
of the electromagnetic field.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.090
So these were some
preliminaries.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.960
Then I thought I want to show
you the power of diagrams

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.900
by showing to you that there are
two different kinds of diagrams

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.620
dominant at short range
and at long range.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.959
And with that we realize
diagrammatically that, because

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.555
of the nature of virtual photons
which are exchanged by the two

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:25.640
neutral atoms, there is
a change in power law.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.705
The power-- the inverse power
of the distance between the two

00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:33.250
neutral atoms is one
higher at long range.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.250
And long range meant-- that also
became clear diagrammatically.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:45.150
Long range means the distance
is longer than the wavelengths

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.819
of the resonant
radiation for the atom.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.070
Any questions about that?

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:17.140
So the goal for the first hour
today is to go from two atoms

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.830
to many, many atoms, which
then form a metal plate,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.970
and make the transition from
forces between neutral atoms

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.280
to forces between two
metal plates, which

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.250
is the famous Casimir force.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.020
And I want you to sort of
hold the thought about what

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.150
is really the
quantum aspect here?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.390
Is it the vacuum?

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.230
Is it the zero
point fluctuations

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.510
of the electromagnetic field?

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.700
Or are the atoms the
zero point fluctuations

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.750
of the atomic oscillators
responsible for those forces?

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.110
So we'll come back to it after
we have discussed the Casimir

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.374
interaction between
two neutral plates.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.410
So maybe one highlight for you
today is that maybe in an hour

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.430
you have should at least
have an expert opinion

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.420
whether zero point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.660
are real or just a convenient
way to describe some physics.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.980
But let's get there.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.590
So the way how I want to
make the transition from two

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.100
neutral atoms to
two metal plates

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.340
is by reminding you that the
potential was proportional

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.590
at long range to 1 over R to the
6, at short range at 1 over R

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.700
to the 6.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.770
And if you had the model that
the long range interaction

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.390
comes, because the
vacuum fluctuations drive

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.240
dipole moments in the
two atoms, then we

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.640
know that the potential
is proportional

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.039
to the polarizability
of atom one times

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.330
the polarizability of atom two.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.270
So let's now extend
that to the interaction

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.090
between an atom and a wall.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:42.850
Well since I don't
know-- at least not

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.900
yet-- how to describe the wall.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.830
I take the position
that, well, we

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.020
have an atom come
close to a wall,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:02.490
but now I extend the wall
to a sphere of radius z.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.930
And it's not obvious that if an
atom interacts with the wall,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.650
if the wall were flat,
it is of course this part

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.480
of the wall which
is most important.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.910
So we should actually get
a quantitative or semi

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.180
quantitative result out of that.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.770
But now I can use a nice
result from electrostatics,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:31.920
which I also discuss in 8421,
in the [? MO1 ?] course, namely

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:40.683
when we have a conducting
sphere of radius c.

00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:47.410
Do you know what the
polarizability of a sphere is?

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.350
You must have also
had this problem

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.700
in classical electrodynamics.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.430
You apply an electric field.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.070
You calculate with the boundary
condition of the sphere

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.700
some spherical
harmonic function.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.740
You calculate what
the dipole moment is,

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.750
and you find the
proportionality constant.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.960
AUDIENCE: It's like z
squared or [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.470
The one thing I want is that
it's proportional to z cube.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.940
It's the volume of the sphere.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.040
And the reason why I discuss
that in atomic physics

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.040
is when we talk about
the dipole moment

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.170
at the polarizability
of the hydrogen atom,

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.460
we find that the polarizability
of the hydrogen atom

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.926
is the pole radius cube.

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:31.880
So it seems that when it
comes to electric fields

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.920
and polarizability, an atom, a
hydrogen atom behaves exactly

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.990
like a conducting sphere,
and the size of the sphere

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.285
is now the size of the atom.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:59.315
But that means now that the
long range potential will now

00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:01.670
be proportional the
polarizability of the atom.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.550
And we lose three
powers in the power law,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.090
because we have
three powers of z

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.830
in the polarizability
of the sphere.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.220
OK, if that worked
so well once, we

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.190
can now use that at
least as a bridge

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.360
to discuss what happens when
we have two metal walls.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:41.510
Well, we can now say
we have two spheres,

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:48.000
and the polarizability
of each sphere

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.030
is proportional to z cubed.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.520
Well when we have
two walls, we want

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.260
to use the potential per area.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.950
So what we had is we
had 1 over R to the 7.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.920
We lose three powers of R
or z, because of one sphere.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.760
Another three powers of the
other sphere, so it's 1 over z.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.190
But when we normalize by area,
it becomes 1 over z squared.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:25.330
And now we find that the
potential is 1 over c cubed.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.300
And at least with it
I have-- I wouldn't

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.550
say derived, but motivated
for you the famous Casimir

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.670
potential, which
is 1 over c cubed.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.740
And I want to give you an
exact derivation of the Casimir

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.150
potential in the
next few minutes.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.420
But before I do that-- yes?

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.950
AUDIENCE: Why did you
choose the spheres to be

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.664
the same size as the
distance between them.

00:11:54.664 --> 00:11:55.590
That seems kind of--

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.965
PROFESSOR: It's
all just a trick.

00:11:56.965 --> 00:11:58.945
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:58.945 --> 00:12:06.260
You know what would happen
is-- let me just go back here.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.760
If I would choose
this sphere smaller,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.330
I would not have given the
atom the whole exposure.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.590
I have to make it
at least larger

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.870
than c to make sure that
the curvature of the sphere

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.330
doesn't dominate and
what the atom sees

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.380
is it sees there is a wall.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.010
But then you can see when I
make this sphere larger than c,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.810
then I delocalize
the dipole moment.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.100
And the bigger sphere
has a big polarizability,

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.040
but the atom which is
so close to the sphere

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.600
doesn't care about it.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.640
So you would say
the right choice

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.350
is just when you think either
picture gets corrupted.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.900
But that's often what it is.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.530
So if you think about
it, it's the only choice.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.547
Both other choices would
lead to an unphysical result,

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:55.130
and you would
immediately realize why.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.260
In one case it's the curvature,
and the other case you're not

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.760
really sampling the
dipole of the sphere

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.980
because you want to
do a dipole field,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:12.730
and if you have a dipole of size
z, the field with the dipole

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.990
starts to be an approximation
if you go distance z away.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.678
Other questions?

00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:23.160
Yes?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.618
AUDIENCE: Can you explain where
the first term [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:26.618 --> 00:13:29.582
z to the [INAUDIBLE] come from?

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.020
PROFESSOR: We had it.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.380
Last class we had the
result that the Casimir--

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.720
that the van der Waal's--
the retarded van der

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.490
Waal's potential is
1 over R to the 7.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.680
But with the physical
picture in mind

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.700
that the van der Waal's
potential at long range, which

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.680
is 1 over R to the 7 comes
because a vacuum fluctuation

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.070
drive to dipoles, and the two
dipoles attract each other.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.640
When each dipole is alpha
1 times a vacuum field,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.260
the other one is alpha
2 times a vacuum field.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.270
But now for this sphere,
alpha is z cubed.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.680
So therefore three
powers in the denominator

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.400
cancel, and I get z to the 4.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.550
So you can say the
alpha 2, I absorbed--

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.350
I used the kind of result
that alpha 2 is z cubed,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.130
and then the alpha 2
cancelled with three powers

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.175
of the distance in
the denominator.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.950
Other questions?

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.570
I have a question for you now.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.780
If you have two metal plates,
what about short range and long

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.340
range?

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.320
We expect something
under the rock.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.970
If we assume a metal
plate, what is the vessel--

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.000
we had the distinction between
long range and short range,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.320
which came from the
resonant radiation

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.860
from the resonant
excitation of the atom.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.075
And when we are closer
than the wave lengths,

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:01.700
we're in short range,
if you're further

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.530
than the wavelengths of
the resonant transition,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.970
we're in long range.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.480
Between an atom and a
plate, well, we still

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.220
have the resonance of the atom.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.740
But what happens when
we have two plates?

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.230
There's clearly no
resonance, so therefore there

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.910
is only one power
law, 1 over z cubed.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.660
But I want you to sort of
think about it for a moment

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.120
whether this is now--
whether everything

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.350
is long range or
everything is short range.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.870
In other words, you say
effective resonant radiation,

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.730
you say effective wavelengths
of the plate lambda

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.490
equals 0 or lambda
equals infinity.

00:15:54.205 --> 00:15:54.705
Any opinion?

00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:04.606
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
ability, so it

00:16:04.606 --> 00:16:06.342
must be infinite [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:19.238 --> 00:16:22.875
Take the two metal
plates, the vacuum energy

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.528
between those
plates, and compare

00:16:24.528 --> 00:16:29.158
it to vacuum energy at
the same volume free space

00:16:29.158 --> 00:16:32.630
and subtract the [INAUDIBLE]
energy difference.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.900
And high frequency components
cancel out, so you have the--

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:43.730
PROFESSOR: OK, we'll actually
do exactly what you suggest,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.210
to compare vacuum energies,
in the next few minutes.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.080
It's not quite
obvious, but I want

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.660
to tell you now we
have made-- by assuming

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.180
the metallic boundary
condition, by assuming

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.050
that we have idealized
metal plates which fulfill

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.200
the boundary condition
that the electric field is

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.839
0 at the surface.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.420
The parallel component of the
[INAUDIBLE] at the surface.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.859
We've made an assumption here,
and the assumption is actually

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:18.980
that the resonant
wavelengths goes to 0,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.280
and resonance frequency
goes to infinity.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.010
And the power law we obtain
is actually the long distance

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.380
power law so to speak,
and for two metal plates,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.510
there is no short distance.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.410
I'm not sure if I can give
you a simple explanation

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:42.010
because the boundary condition
is so idealized that you don't

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.372
recognize, you don't smell
any atomic resonance anymore.

00:17:45.372 --> 00:17:46.830
But maybe the one
thing I would say

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.770
is that you say the boundary
condition, metallic boundary

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.680
condition for infinitely
high frequency.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.340
And sometimes that
would also mean

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.150
that the plasma frequency of
the metal is pushed to infinity.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.800
We come back to that
in the next chapter.

00:18:24.947 --> 00:18:25.530
Any questions?

00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:28.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.680
AUDIENCE: Excellent question.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.840
I will go for you now through--
its mainly classical e and m.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.990
This is why I use
pre-written slides.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.910
We sum up over all modes
with a boundary condition,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.680
with a metallic
boundary condition.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.960
If you have in general a
dielectric or semiconductor

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.420
which is not an ideal metal, has
different boundary conditions,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.320
the Casimir force will change.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.720
And this is actually a pretty
outstanding difficult problem

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.930
where people have
really chewed on hard.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.830
I think Lifschitz has some
famous solution on it.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:15.760
What is the Casimir force for
an arbitrary dielectric constant

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.720
of the surface material?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.060
But absolutely yes.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.260
If you don't have a
metallic boundary condition,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.385
your Casimir force changes.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.400
I think this is sort of
an interesting point,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.260
and it may trigger
immediately discussions

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.342
what does it really mean.

00:19:32.342 --> 00:19:34.550
But let me go now through
school the derivation where

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.800
we have metallic
boundary condition,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.700
and this actually leads to
a quantitative derivation

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.690
of the Casimir force.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:46.720
Quantitative in the
way that we get--

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.370
we're not just
getting the power law.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.530
We get the prefector.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.320
We everything 100%
of this derivation.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.075
Collin?

00:19:55.075 --> 00:19:58.012
AUDIENCE: So what is the
mechanism for the Casimir force

00:19:58.012 --> 00:19:58.512
changing?

00:19:58.512 --> 00:20:01.949
Because if think of it in the
picture of two metal plates,

00:20:01.949 --> 00:20:05.386
the lower density and modes
inside and then do outside.

00:20:05.386 --> 00:20:09.314
Even with the arbitrary boundary
condition, I [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:09.314 --> 00:20:10.787
But what is the
physical mechanism

00:20:10.787 --> 00:20:13.615
for changing the form?

00:20:13.615 --> 00:20:15.240
PROFESSOR: To the
best of my knowledge,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.830
it is the density of modes.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.215
But it's very subtle.

00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:22.750
I suggest, since not
everybody is probably

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.850
familiar with the
way how I will count

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.710
all the modes in the metal
plate, let me just do that,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.170
and then we should-- and
I hope then it's obvious,

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.570
or we should then discuss
the boundary conditions being

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.210
modified.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.370
And you have a question?

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.619
AUDIENCE: Yes, but maybe we
can discuss it after this.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.140
PROFESSOR: So the
idea is the following,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.320
if the Casimir force
is only due to zero

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.030
point fluctuations of
electromagnetic field--

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.280
let me say up front this
is a valid assumption.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.510
I get a valid result.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.540
But I tell you in
half an hour that you

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.460
can take another
perspective and say

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.480
this is just a
holistic description.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.520
There are other derivations
of the Casimir force

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.195
which do not use the concept
of zero point energy at all.

00:21:10.195 --> 00:21:11.570
So in other words,
I'm presenting

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.330
you one presentation of
the problem, one solution

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.380
of the problem, but there's a
whole different formulation.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.780
But here I assume-- mean
I can easily modulate.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.920
OK, well here we have
two metal plates.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.810
We want to understand if
there is potential energy

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.040
and interaction between
the two metal plates.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.800
And let's just calculate what is
the total energy of the system.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.400
And if I have two
metal plates, which

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.440
are two mathematical
boundary conditions,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.680
all I have to calculate
is the ground state

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.950
of the electromagnetic
field in between.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.800
And that means I have to
find all of the modes,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.810
and each mode contribute
h bar omega over 2.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.600
So this is our agenda now.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.530
We say the metal plates
are not real objects.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.580
They're mathematical
boundary conditions.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.980
Looks like a good assumption.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.440
And now based on those
boundary conditions

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.935
we calculate the zero
point energy of the world,

00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:06.320
at least of the
electromagnetic world.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.390
And then we ask if the plates
are a little bit closer,

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.290
tool has the total zero
point energy changed?

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.520
And when it has
changed that means

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.270
there is a force between
the atoms because

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.570
of potential changes as
a function of distance.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:25.000
So this is the agenda
I went to execute now.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.190
Any questions about
what we want to do?

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.770
As you know when you
write out modes in e and m

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.990
and you want to do it exactly
the many, many indices.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.140
But this is a result
of which could actually

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.490
come straight out of Jackson.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.940
For your convenience,
this is also

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.330
discussed-- a wonderful
discussion by Serge Haroche.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.630
In some these summer school
notes from the '70s or '80s.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.610
I've posted those on the web.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.880
So if there is a mathematical
detail you want to look up,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.400
this is posted on the web.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.898
So anyway, we have two metal
plates with a distance l.

00:23:05.898 --> 00:23:10.500
And we have metallic
boundary conditions.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:18.000
That means that when we
calculate the modes, we get TE

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.030
modes and TM modes.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.620
TE modes means there is no
longitudinal electric field.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.460
TM modes mean there is no
longitudinal magnetic field.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:42.350
And the frequency of each mode
is discrete in the z direction.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.710
In the z direction we
have standing waves,

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.460
which are labelled with
an intentional value of m,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:56.050
whereas parallel to the plate
the modes can have an arbitrary

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.620
transverse wave vector k.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.280
And when we look at the
dispersion relation,

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.630
the frequency of those
modes is in quadrature.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.960
You can see the
component k squared c

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.230
squared of the
transverse propagation

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.658
plus the component
of the standing wave.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.940
So for each m, for
each integer value,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.680
we have a TE and TM mode, with
the exception of m equals 0.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.360
For m equals 0 we
don't have a TE mode.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.900
We only have a TM mode.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.245
So that's just fresh
out of Jackson.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.057
But it's very
important now-- and I

00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:37.890
want to spend a little
bit more time with it

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.180
so it's just a purely
classic result.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.680
What is the density of states?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.510
Well, let's assume
we have a given m.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.990
So we have a standing
wave perpendicular

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.310
to the capacitor
plates, and therefore

00:24:54.310 --> 00:25:01.840
now the density of modes only
comes-- the density of modes

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.420
only comes from the transverse.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.620
Let me just get my toolbar back.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.060
So it is from this k squared.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.780
And you know that
the number of modes

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.520
is proportional to
the volume in k space.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:31.640
And the important part is that
I can write this as dk squared.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.480
But k squared is
d omega squared.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.240
And this gives me omega d omega.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.120
So for each n value, for each
discrete mode perpendicular

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.500
to the plates, we
have now a density

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.030
of modes which goes
as omega d omega.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.440
Before I show you the
mathematical expression,

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.730
let me just sort of plot
that, what that means.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:07.230
The density of modes was--
the number of modes was omega

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.320
d omega.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.690
That means the density of modes
was proportional with omega.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:19.570
That means for m equals 0
we started omega equals 0,

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.430
and we get a straight line.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:28.340
For m equals 1-- m
equals 1 shown in green,

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.060
and m equals 2 shown in purple.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:40.070
The frequency omega--
we have omega squared

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:47.730
is sick the quadrature sum
k squared and m squared.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:53.090
So therefore if you
want to ask what

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.620
is the density for modes for
m equals 1 or me equals 2,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.020
you have to start at the lowest
frequency for m equals 1,

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.230
at the lowest frequency
for m equals 2.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.030
But then as we just derived,
the density of modes

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.590
is proportional to omega.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.530
So what you we to
do in the end, we

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.820
want to sum those modes all up.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.070
And what we will
observe is that here we

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.630
have a line with slope 1.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.400
Here we have to sum
two lines with slope 1.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.680
Here we have to sum
three lines with slope 1.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.460
So progressively, the slope
gets higher and higher.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.350
But the slope, which increases
linearly with the coordinate

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.070
axis.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.830
If it were continuously,
would just be a parabola.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.670
So in other words, if
I would [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.470
the density of states which
comes from the exact mode

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.500
spectrum, if I
would [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.400
it would be parabola.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.180
And parabolic density of
state, the number of modes

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.160
is omega squared d omega.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.870
This is three dimensional space.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.030
So in other words, what
we observe is what exactly

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.220
the effect of the
boundary condition is.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.770
Instead of getting this
smooth parabola omega squared,

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.960
we have sort of
broken up the parabola

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.880
into piecewise linear pieces.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.030
And the fact that we have
a boundary condition,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.620
that we plates in free space,
and not just the space,

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.260
is actually the difference
between the two.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.220
So it is the difference
between the two, which

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.030
leads to the fact that a
boundary condition modifies

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.990
the vacuum energy.

00:28:41.027 --> 00:28:41.526
Questions?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:52.070
OK with that the
rest is mathematics,

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:54.380
but I want to show you
the steps because it

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.350
is ingenious mathematics.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.120
It makes a few approximations.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.680
It creates a few infinities
and gets rid of it.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.612
It's actually rather wild,
but amazing that, in the end,

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:09.050
we have a simple exact result.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:14.740
OK so the most important thing
is we have a density of states.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:23.320
And the density of states for
one m is proportional to omega,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.639
but now we have
to multiply-- when

00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.930
we want to know what is the
density of state in a given

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.830
omega, we have to
multiply with the integer

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:37.330
number of discrete modes which
are available at this omega.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.580
So this is because there is
only one m equals 0 node.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.470
We have a one here.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.240
And then for m equals 1 and
higher, we have two [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.160
between TE and TM.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.930
So this is just
counting the modes.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.850
And this is now a
mathematical trick

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.830
that, instead of
counting the modes--

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.070
it's an integer-- we can sum
up heavy side step functions

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.800
and sum over all m.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.780
This is just an
[? exact v, ?] right?

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:12.820
But this is something which
helps us in the next step

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.400
to do an integral.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.480
So now so far we haven't
made any approximation.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.960
We've just reminded
ourselves what

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.890
is the exact result
of classical e and m.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:31.990
OK, but now we want to
calculate the zero point.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:33.940
So now it's getting
interesting, because we

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.990
take the classical result, and
take it into quantum physics.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.990
The first step is very innocent.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:45.060
We say each mode contributes
h bar omega over 2.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.070
And then we integrate with
the density of states.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.290
And the next line is
also an exact result,

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.360
just using the density of
modes from the previous page.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.640
But of course, now we
are asking for trouble.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.120
We are integrating with
omega squared d omega,

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.810
and there is uv catastrophe.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.450
Now I can say I can put
on my mathematical head

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.400
and say let's add a
convergent term, something

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.420
which exponentially decreases
with omega, which is just

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.120
cutting off the
high frequency part.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.670
And I hope that in the end--
and this will come out too--

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.820
that I get a result which is
independent of the cutoff.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:35.570
So by choosing this cut of
parameter lambda to zero,

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.320
I have-- if this is
zero, I have no cut off.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.920
So maybe I can introduce a
cut off, and then at the end

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.180
let lambda go to got to zero.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.270
And if this gives me
a physical result,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.070
I've sort of mathematically
tricked around.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.800
But I also like the physical
justification for that.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.060
I mean you know that a
metal plate tennis has

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.110
not metallic boundary conditions
at infinitely high frequency.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.730
If you go deep to the
x rays and gamma rays,

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.770
it becomes transparent.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.100
So therefore, we would argue
that, once we go to very, very

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:12.130
high frequencies,
the modes do not

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.500
feel that there is a
boundary condition,

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.720
and therefore we may be allowed
to do some physical cut off.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.000
OK so we do this
cut off by-- so now

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.720
we have to find the
zero point energy.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.920
The zero point energy
has a sum over m.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.230
And I call each
integral I sub n.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.030
And this integral
is the omega square

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.240
from the density of
states, but now multiplied

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.510
with a convergence term.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.260
Whether it's
mathematical or physical.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:56.350
And by introducing
this cut off, I

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.190
can now exactly
solve the integral.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.130
The omega squared can be
taken out of the integral

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.480
by taking the second derivative.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.620
And this is just an
exponential function

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.930
which can be integrated.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.910
And therefore we have a
mathematically exact result.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.936
So we are now able
to do the integral

00:33:12.936 --> 00:33:14.560
because we have
avoided the divergence.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.460
OK.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.240
Now we come back and say we are
really interested if the cutoff

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.740
is pushed to higher
and higher frequency.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.780
And this means lambda equals 0.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:34.050
So therefore, we want
to take this expression

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.970
and expand it around
lambda equals 0.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.720
Well, you could say that's
physically very well motivated.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.660
But if I take this
function, which

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.770
is lambda e to the lambda
over x times e to the x,

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:55.620
and expand it, I get
divergence is 1 over x squared.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.810
So you would say how
can you expand it.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.040
Let's see what happens.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.100
Let's just do it.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.611
Let's say we are interested
around lambda or x equals 0.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.139
We have some
divergencies now, but we

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:14.630
have to find a way
to deal with it.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.929
So we get rid of some
of the divergencies

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.780
in the following way.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.540
By saying, well, if you simply
calculate the zero point

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.090
energy between those
two capacitor plates,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.570
and then when,
let's say, if there

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:35.909
is-- if the plates come closer
and there is less zero point

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.989
energy, we would see the
plates attract each other.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.179
But what happens is the
plates are not moving,

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.690
and there is no
world behind them.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.250
The world is sort of as it is.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.520
And that means we
have to sort of now

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.239
look more carefully at the zero
point energy of our capacitor

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.050
plates where l is small.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.900
And the rest of the world.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.460
So we are now
representing the world

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.440
as a big capacitor of size l 0.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.390
And then our plate
is just moving

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:10.900
within that, because we are
not assuming that then the two

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.830
capacitor plates
attract each other

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.995
and move towards each other
that the size of the universe

00:35:15.995 --> 00:35:17.430
is changing.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.620
So we want to move a boundary
condition within the universe.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.240
So therefore, the correct
expression for the zero point

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.940
energy is not the zero
point energy of capacitor l.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.440
It's the zero point
energy of a capacitor size

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.210
l plus of a capacitor
l0 naught minus l.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.680
And so we take the
result and simply add

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.340
the expressions for
l and l0 minus l.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:51.450
And what is now a nice is that
the first highly divergent term

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.560
with 1 over lambda
to the 4-- reminder

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.810
that we want to let
lambda go to zero.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.810
It becomes independent of l.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.700
So we would say, well,
if there is an infinity,

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.700
it doesn't change with l.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.480
It doesn't provide a potential.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.130
It's just one of those
infinities which is constant,

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.220
which is not
affecting the physics.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.940
Also here, this is
independent of l.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:24.670
And then the next term gives us
the famous Casimir potential,

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.820
1 over l cubed, and it
is independent of lambda.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.585
So we have the result which
was independent of the cut

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:33.020
off we introduced earlier.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:40.070
So therefore, we have
derived, with a little bit

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.130
of hand waving to
navigate about infinities,

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:50.290
that the potential between two
metal plates is 1 over l cubed.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:55.130
a squared was the area, the
size of the capacitor plates.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.560
And this is the exact prefector.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.690
Or if you want to
figure out what

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.820
is the pressure off the vacuum.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.007
Pressure is, of course,
force per unit area.

00:37:07.007 --> 00:37:09.090
So you take the derivative
of the potential that's

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.990
the force, that's the
force per unit area,

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.250
and this is now the
vacuum pressure.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.730
Sort of funny now you
can put in the unit.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.971
It's 10 to the minus 5
millibar at a distance

00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:22.720
of one micrometer.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.740
So anyway this is, I think,
the classic deviation

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:36.100
of the Casimir potential
by, I would say,

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.990
exactly summing
up the zero point

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.210
energy within a certain
boundary condition.

00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:48.660
Good.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:00.140
Maybe to address
Collin's question.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.840
What would happen if the
metal plates were maybe

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.840
semiconductors or had a
different dielectrical

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.120
constant.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.880
The mode spectrum would change.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.090
AUDIENCE: Like if you had
mixed boundary conditions.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.562
You don't have these
nicely spaced--

00:38:15.562 --> 00:38:17.270
PROFESSOR: I don't
know how to calculate.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.860
That's a hard problem,
and a lot of people

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.610
have really worked
very, very hard on it.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.190
It seems for idealized boundary
condition you can do it easily,

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.020
but it has been
clearly a challenge

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.170
to mathematical physics.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.080
And I'm not even sure if it has
been solved in all generality

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.110
or only in special
examples to extend that

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.410
to every type of surfaces.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:41.260
But we can, for instance, assume
if you have a conductor, which

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.780
is not-- conductor which has
not infinite conductance,

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.350
0 resistivity, then
the electric field

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.790
can penetrate a little
bit into the conductor.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.180
And if the electric
field penetrates into it,

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.150
it changes the
frequency of the mode.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:01.377
So it's clear that the boundary
conditions have an effect here.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.670
But let's now have
some discussion.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:28.670
We had focused before on
the force between two atoms.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:33.370
And if we use a microscopic
model for the metal plates,

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:39.170
it should be, it must be
possible to obtain the Casimir

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.770
potential by just summing up
all the forces between atoms.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:46.430
Because ultimately if
you have no metal plates,

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.560
you don't have any force.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.950
Where s-- in the
last few minutes,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.590
we focused on the derivation
which was simply summing up

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.380
the zero point energies.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.900
And there are two
papers which I've

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:09.035
posted on the wiki which
argue that both results are

00:40:09.035 --> 00:40:09.535
equivalent.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.120
So I would really
recommend to you--

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.350
he expresses it much
better than I can.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.170
Read the introduction
and the conclusion

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.030
from Bob Jaffe's paper.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.700
He clearly says in
the introduction

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.190
that there are a lot of books
and references by famous people

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.170
who have said the
Casimir force is

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.920
the manifestation of
the zero point energy.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.030
The fact that people have
observed the Casimir force

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:40.290
means that h bar
omega over 2 is real.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.950
Those authors take
the opposite approach.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.060
They say this is just heuristic.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:49.980
It's convenient.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.830
You can get the correct result.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:55.130
But there is an
equivalent derivation

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.680
which gives exactly the same
result, which focuses only

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.620
on pair wise interactions
between atoms,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:07.090
and it does not include any--
it doesn't make any reference

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.450
to the zero point energy of
the electromagnetic field.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.800
So therefore, one, I would
agree with those authors

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.450
that the conclusion
is there is absolutely

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:23.260
no observational evidence
for the zero point energy,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.560
that the zero point
energy is sort of not just

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.450
convenient counting, but
that it is real energy.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:32.420
And the Casimir
force, of course, also

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.550
it has often been quoted
as a counter example

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.400
that this is a
direct observation,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.650
is not-- should not
be regarded as such.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:48.850
Now people at MIT
probably know Bob Jaffe.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.560
He's a high energy physicist.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.310
And why is he interested
in atomic physics?

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.015
Why is he interested
in the Casimir force?

00:41:57.015 --> 00:42:00.680
Well, the question of
zero point energies

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.060
is very, very important in
these days for dark energy.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.550
I mean, you know that 80% of
the energy of the universe

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.200
is dark energy.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.930
Then there's dark matter, and
then there is baryonic matter.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:16.690
But this dark energy
is really mysterious.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.810
And one candidate
for dark energy

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:23.062
is the dark energy simply comes
from the zero point energy.

00:42:23.062 --> 00:42:24.520
So therefore, people
are now really

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.280
interested is the
dark energy real.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.380
And if it is real, does it
have a gravitational effect?

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.320
Does it change the
metric of space?

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.955
And can it accelerate the
expansion of the universe?

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.140
Of course, you have a problem
if you calculate the zero point

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.530
energy, you don't
introduce a cut off.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:52.230
You have a spectacular
uv divergence.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:57.590
You can maybe now
concatenate the divergence

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:03.570
by saying, OK, eventually if
the wavelengths become shorter

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.120
and shorter and shorter,
there is a cut off.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.740
And if you have no
idea at all, you

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.000
would introduce a cut off
at the Planck lengths,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.770
because beyond
the Planck lengths

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:17.280
all physical
descriptions break down.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.870
But if you cut it off
at the Planck lengths,

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.520
you find that the zero
point energy of all modes

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.570
is larger than the observed
dark energy in the universe

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.060
for acceleration of
the cosmic expansion

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.970
by 124 orders of magnitude.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.920
And if you think you want
to introduce a cut off which

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.340
is maybe the classical
electron radius.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.540
The classical electron
radius is the radius

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.980
of a charged sphere for which
the electrostatic energy would

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.590
just be the rest
energy of the electron.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:55.310
Well, then you're off by
43 orders of magnitude.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.940
So some people have called
those discrepancies,

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.960
which are completely
unresolved as of now,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.490
the biggest failure ever
of theoretical physics.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.410
So anyway, that's why there is
renewed interest in the Casimir

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.180
force.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.140
And at least in
electromagnetics,

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.940
we have a very,
very simple model.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.450
And we have experiments which
measure the Casimir force,

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.010
but, as I've said, it cannot
be regarded as a direct

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.017
observation of the
zero point energy.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:32.230
OK, let me now
come to a question

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:40.660
we started discussing earlier,
namely if we-- here we

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.550
have atoms.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.100
Here we have a metalized
boundary condition.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.990
So maybe let's just talk
for one minute about it.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:52.940
What kind of assumptions
do we make about atoms

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.900
when we replace them by a
metallic boundary condition?

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.770
From the whole derivation
of the Casimir force

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:08.480
it's not obvious that there
are no atomic properties which

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.090
have entered the calculation
of the Casimir potential.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:21.350
What Bob Jaffe argues in
this paper-- and again,

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.580
it's wonderful reading.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.470
I really recommend Just if you
want to enjoy some physics,

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.000
open up the document and read
the first and the last page.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.160
The Casimir force from an
idealized boundary condition

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.540
is completely independent
of atomic properties.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.290
So therefore, it must be
a limit where-- well, we

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.560
talked about the
resonant wavelengths,

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.950
but we can also talk about
the fine structure constant,

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:52.140
because the fine structure
constant in a hydrogenic model

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.300
provides what that resident
transitions in hydrogen are.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.510
So you can argue if
something is completely

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:00.760
independent of
atomic properties,

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.310
somehow by sweeping things
under the rug we must have set

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:08.400
alpha to either
zero or infinite.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.340
Because if it is
set to any value,

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.370
it would correspond to some
version of the hydrogen

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.970
atom which has a
resonant radiation.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.340
So the question is,
is alpha set to zero

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.900
or is alpha set to infinity when
you derive the Casimir force?

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.755
And I think this is
now easy to discuss,

00:46:24.755 --> 00:46:27.670
because the fine
structure constant alpha

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.870
is e squared over h bar c.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:33.050
If you set alpha
to zero, you do it

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:36.640
by setting the charge
of the atoms to zero,

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.130
and then you have no
interaction at all.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.680
So therefore, if you
want to have the Casimir

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.360
force in a limit which
is independent of atomic

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.290
properties, the alpha equals
zero limit gives no force.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:57.160
So therefore, the
equivalence this picture,

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.610
summing up over the electrons
and obtaining the Casimir force

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.760
for the metallic
boundary condition,

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.520
this equivalence happens
when you do this derivation

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.585
and set the fine structure
constant to infinity.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:20.780
How big is the fine
structure constant?

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.940
1 over 137.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.400
In some expansions of
alpha and alpha squared,

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.000
it's actually a
smaller parameter.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.780
And now I'm telling you when
you have two metal plates

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.420
and measure the
Casimir force, this

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.820
corresponds to the
infinite alpha limit.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.940
So this is now
getting complicated

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:44.330
and I can refer here only
to Bob Jaffe's paper.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:49.250
But he shows that when you
go to distances of 0.5 micron

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.200
that people have measured
the Casimir force.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.415
You are already the alpha
equals infinity limit.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:03.060
If you are-- I wish I
could read my handwriting.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.700
I think that's minus 5.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.730
If alpha is larger
than 10 to the minus 5.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:16.020
So therefor, alpha equals 1
over 137 is for that purpose

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.670
already very, very well
in the large alpha limit.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.490
But I just hate
this result here.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:27.160
This is rather complicated.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.560
Bob Jaffe says that to get the
Casimir potential by summing up

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.189
over atoms is actually
a quite challenging

00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:35.105
mathematical exercise.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.106
Questions?

00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:44.010
Yes?

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.243
AUDIENCE: If these calculations
of summing over atoms

00:48:47.243 --> 00:48:51.878
has been [INAUDIBLE], then
what is it-- we can just

00:48:51.878 --> 00:48:54.373
talk about the plates being
dielectric from that atom

00:48:54.373 --> 00:48:57.367
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:57.367 --> 00:49:00.940
PROFESSOR: There are solutions
for dielectric plates.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:05.160
And sometimes when
people do experiments,

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.342
the best surfaces you can
get is a silicon surface.

00:49:10.342 --> 00:49:12.550
Because they want you to do
qualitative measurements,

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.545
they're discussing corrections
due to the dielectric constant.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.220
I know the problem
has been worked out

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.080
for dielectric surfaces.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.430
I assume not by doing the
transition from summing up atom

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:31.890
by atom, but by rather
looking at the boundary

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:34.340
condition for
electromagnetic fields

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.380
in the presence of a dielectric.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.240
But I don't know more
details about that.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.060
Yes?

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.810
AUDIENCE: This question
may not make sense

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.393
because I haven't
thought [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:48.393 --> 00:49:50.530
But again, when we
consider two plates,

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:53.624
if you have room for two
atoms, we get the two 1 over R

00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:57.802
to the 6, 1 over
R to the 7 cases.

00:49:57.802 --> 00:49:59.802
Once of which is the
retarded Casimir potential,

00:49:59.802 --> 00:50:04.046
but for two plates-- again, we
conclude that it was more like

00:50:04.046 --> 00:50:05.180
the short range--

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.346
PROFESSOR: Well, long range.

00:50:06.346 --> 00:50:07.543
We are always retarded.

00:50:07.543 --> 00:50:10.898
AUDIENCE: OK, but then
I'm a bit confused.

00:50:10.898 --> 00:50:12.856
Because then if you say
alpha goes to infinity,

00:50:12.856 --> 00:50:17.200
don't you have an
h bar or c to zero?

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:17.700
Oh wait.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.910
That makes sense.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:23.290
PROFESSOR: Alpha
infinity is-- we

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:27.440
know that this is the
vastness of the electron.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.690
The [? Whitbeck ?] constant is
alpha squared times smaller.

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.800
And the [? Whitbeck ?]
constant-- well,

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.790
a quarter of the
[? Whitbeck ?] constant

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:39.707
is alignment alpha radiation.

00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:41.290
So anyway, the
[? Whitbeck ?] constant

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.880
is a scale factor in the
transition frequencies

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.050
of the hydrogen atom.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.710
And so therefore,
it is consistent

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:50.440
that, if you make alpha
large, we actually

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.780
get-- we push the frequency
of the atomic transition

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.230
to very, very high frequencies.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:02.870
And that would mean the resonant
wavelengths goes to zero.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:06.250
And therefore any finite
distance between the capacitor

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.920
plate is, in the long
range, is longer than

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.480
the wavelengths
of the transition.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.972
AUDIENCE: I think
equivalently you

00:51:11.972 --> 00:51:13.930
could say if the speed
of light is really slow,

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.074
you always will
have [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:17.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.240
You can do the
transition in many ways

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.530
by tuning the speed of
light, or tuning the charge,

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:25.605
but it all has the
same implication.

00:51:28.314 --> 00:51:28.980
Other questions?

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.608
Lindsay?

00:51:32.608 --> 00:51:34.978
AUDIENCE: Is there any
other observable reason

00:51:34.978 --> 00:51:37.640
why we should
constantly be thinking

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.622
about Casimir forces
and dark energy?

00:51:40.622 --> 00:51:43.610
Like experimenting [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.420
PROFESSOR: As far as I know,
this question about dark energy

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.100
and whether it is
related or not to zero

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:54.670
point energy of the
field is completely open.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:57.740
I think if you had an idea
how to do a decisive-- if any

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:02.280
of you had an idea how to make
a decisive experiment measuring

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.430
whether zero point
energies are real or not,

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:06.820
that would have a big impact.

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.010
As far as I know,
it's completely open.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:10.670
Nobody has really good idea.

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:18.460
So some people feel,
mathematically, the zero point

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.810
energy has the right, correct
physically characteristics.

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:27.920
Zero point energy could
explain the extra term

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.360
in Einstein's field
equation, which is often

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.530
called the cosmological
constant term.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:37.910
But the quantity, it's so
many orders of magnitude

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:41.680
off that people don't even
know if that is correct or not.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.360
One could also say, well,
maybe zero point energies

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.500
do not give rise at all to
any gravitation potential.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.710
And therefore maybe if
energy doesn't give rise

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:52.600
to gravitational potential,
maybe the energy is not real.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.570
And what we find, what is
responsible for the expansion

00:52:55.570 --> 00:53:10.084
of the universe is gravity--
so Einstein's-- what's the

00:53:10.084 --> 00:53:11.000
constant called again?

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:11.912
I just mentioned it.

00:53:11.912 --> 00:53:12.870
AUDIENCE: Cosmological.

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.260
PROFESSOR: Cosmological.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.420
So that is just the
cosmological constant,

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.120
but the cosmological constant
reflects something else

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.000
in the universe and
is not related at all

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:21.930
to zero point energy.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:26.190
To the best of my knowledge,
these are the possibilities.

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:37.180
OK, so let's go back to atoms.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:44.120
Our next big chapter 12
is on resonant scattering.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.510
Just that you see the
structure of the course.

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:05.660
I wanted to introduce sort of
some mysteries and subtleties

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.280
of electromagnetic interactions
to you by using diagrams,

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.440
by using an exact
formulation of QED.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.510
And then I gave you
one example where

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.720
we could use those
diagrams, and these

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.570
were van der Waal's forces.

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.890
So we got a little bit side
tracked with the vacuum,

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.800
with van der Waal's
and Casimir forces,

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.670
but now we want to go
back to the diagrams.

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.250
And there is one aspect
of the diagrams which

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:33.190
is sort of fascinating,
and this is where we really

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:37.280
need a treatment which goes
beyond perturbation theory.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:40.820
And this is when we
have resonant radiation.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:46.680
When resonant light
interacts with atoms.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.810
Because, as I'm
going to show you,

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.910
we have then in any
perturbative expression

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:55.800
zero in the energy denominator,
and we would have divergence.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.750
So I want to show
you now, partially

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:01.180
also for the beauty of
the physical theory,

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.790
how can we deal-- how can
we fix those divergencies?

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.750
How can we fix
those infinities we

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:10.750
encounter in
perturbation theory?

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.850
The answer will be we get
rid of these infinities

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:17.670
by summing up an infinite
number of diagrams.

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:19.630
So I'm going to show
you now-- it actually

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:22.470
sounds so much more
harder than it is.

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.860
How, with rather modest
mathematical effort,

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:30.100
we can perform an infinite
sum over diagrams.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.230
And I want to show you
what those diagram are.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:35.560
And the result of that is that
the divergencies disappear,

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.510
and we have a valid
description of what

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.270
happens when atoms encounter
resonant radiation.

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:53.850
So I'm following here,
almost religiously,

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.080
the atom photon
interaction book.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:01.860
So this in production is
a summary of those pages.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:13.440
So when we discussed
diagrams, we

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:20.180
wanted to figure out what is
the amplitude for a system

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.730
to go from an initial
to a final state.

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:27.120
And those were the
matrix elements

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.260
of the t matrix, the
transition matrix.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:43.890
And if we do it in
second order-- well,

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:49.520
remember the structure
is in second order.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.200
We sort of emit a
photon, virtual or real.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.290
We have another photon.

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.280
This gives us second order.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:06.120
And in between the
system propagates

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.280
with its eigen energy.

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:20.930
So this was the structure
of the diagrams we had.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:26.640
And this term here,
let's expand it

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:31.115
in one wave functions of
the unperturbed Hamiltonian.

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.680
And then we obtain this
following structure.

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:45.420
So this is just rewriting
in a very suggestive way

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.330
what we had discussed before.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:55.190
And the case I focus on
now is the interaction

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:58.240
of atoms with resonant
light, because this

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.070
is when we have divergencies.

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:03.730
If we have state a, state b.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:07.760
We have a laser and
we scatter light.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:18.190
If the frequency is
approximately resonant,

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:27.960
then those perturbative
results have a divergency.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:32.000
So for resonant light
scattering, the typical matrix

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.410
element we are interested in,
we start and end of course

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.370
in the ground state.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:37.300
We scatter photon.

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.110
We go up to an excited state
and go back to the ground state.

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:45.410
But we started initially with
a photon of wave vector k

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:48.060
and polarization epsilon.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.270
And this may be different
for the scattered light.

00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:04.780
The interaction happens by
the interaction operator,

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.950
which, for the purpose
of this discussion,

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:15.480
can either be the A dot p
term or the d dot E term.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.230
We've discussed about
the special role

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:18.730
of the a squared term.

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:20.180
We discussed it earlier.

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:23.090
I don't want to include it
in the discussion right now.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.395
And then you would
say-- just want

00:59:33.395 --> 00:59:34.770
to make sure they
do not confuse.

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.610
In second order
perturbation theory,

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:39.230
you always have an
energy denominator.

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:42.110
But as I also explained to
you, the energy denominator

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.340
comes from the free propagator.

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.010
You had a dot
propagate and a dot--

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:52.030
and what is the time evolution
of this free propagation when

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:53.580
you integrate it with time?

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.500
This gave rise to the
energy denominator.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.547
Just a side remark.

00:59:56.547 --> 00:59:58.130
So you should be
very familiar that we

00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.830
have an energy denominator.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:03.260
But now this energy
denominator--

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.570
the initial energy is
the initial atomic state

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.570
plus the photon.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:13.360
And then if you want
to sum over all states,

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.090
I can just put in
here the operator H0.

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:20.110
But you may immediately think
about it, the only state which

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:23.570
really matters is the state b.

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:28.450
And what matters is only when
we go through intermediate state

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:32.860
b, then H0 is Eb, and
then we have a divergence

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.720
because the denominator is 0.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.380
So let's see how we can fix it.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.250
But let me first give you
the perturbative result,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:49.040
which you have seen
many, many times.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.020
It is the product of
two matrix elements.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.580
We have an intermediate state.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.720
The excited state
without photon.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:06.880
We started with a photon,
and we end up with a photon.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.770
And here we have our
dipole or A dot p term.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:20.170
And our energy
denominator diverges

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:24.890
when the frequency of the
photon approaches the resonance

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:25.390
frequency.

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:32.260
Well, how can we fix it?

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:37.150
You know that in
many cases you're

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:43.100
just adding an
imaginary part to it,

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.480
which reflects that, due to
the coupling with the vacuum

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.590
of the electromagnetic field,
the excited state is broadened.

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:56.460
And it gives its energy
an imaginary part.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.240
This of course is
very phenomenological,

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:07.580
but at least technically
it avoids the divergence.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:13.070
Now what I want to show
you, in the next 15 minutes

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:17.320
and we continue on
Wednesday, is how

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.060
I can get this result of
a very rigorous approach.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.900
I want to use the
diagrammatic approach.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.510
I want to sum an infinite
number of diagrams.

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:30.680
And will tell you what are the
approximations to get this.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.880
For instance, as you know, when
you have an imaginary part,

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.460
when you have just an
imaginary part of the energy,

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.940
the physics of it is
exponential decay.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:45.040
Well I hope, not today
but on Wednesday,

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.360
you realize what assumptions
lead to exponential decay,

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.350
and that, in principle, non
exponential decay is rather

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.810
the standard than the exception.

01:02:57.810 --> 01:02:59.870
But the effects are small.

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:01.700
But I want to show you.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.130
So in some sense
I want to give--

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:07.200
we have to go through
a half an hour of work

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.770
to derive this result.

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.210
So you'd say, what's about it?

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.930
You just get the
phenomenological result.

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:15.870
Well, we have put it
on a rigorous basis.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.630
And number two is we do
understand what assumptions

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:22.050
really go into this
phenomenological result.

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:31.680
So the way how we will
actually obtain this result

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:49.510
is that in-- the second order
diagram is that you start

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:52.980
in state a, you go in state
b, and you're back in state a,

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.190
and you exchange photons.

01:03:56.190 --> 01:04:03.650
So the way how we-- the physical
picture we want to use now

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:12.540
is after the photon is
absorbed right here,

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:18.855
the system is not propagating
with the Hamiltonian H0.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:24.220
It will propagate with
the Hamiltonian H.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.010
If we do that, then we
avoid the divergence.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.230
We get a result which can be
applied toward-- the formalism

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.080
can be applied to
many situations.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.910
And in one limiting
case, we obtain that.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.840
So the physics behind
it is the following.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.260
The divergence which we
encounter in resonant physics

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:50.705
is only a divergence because
we assume the atom in state b

01:04:50.705 --> 01:04:52.210
is naked.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:55.530
It's an excited state
of an isolated atom.

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:59.290
But in reality, the
state b interacts

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:01.530
by virtual photon
emission, interacts

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.900
with all the modes
of the vacuum.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.320
And once we throw that in
by saying that between two--

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.640
between absorbing and
emitting a photon,

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.630
the state b propagates not
with a free Hamiltonian,

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:19.640
but with the total Hamiltonian,
we avoid the divergence.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.910
But this is no longer
a perturbative result.

01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:26.820
And let me illustrate
that to you.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:38.590
If you take the energy
denominator, omega minus

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:47.980
and omega 0, and we add
the imaginary part to it,

01:05:47.980 --> 01:06:00.560
I can Taylor expand it, assuming
the imaginary part is small.

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:10.220
Well, that's sort of
a trivial expansion,

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.210
but now you should
know that gamma,

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:15.400
the rate of
spontaneous emission,

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.990
the simplest
expression is obtained

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:20.470
in [INAUDIBLE] is called
null in the second order

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:23.450
in the interaction Hamiltonian.

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:25.310
Spontaneous emission
is proportional

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:28.370
to the atomic dipole
matrix element squared.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.840
So it's second order
in the Hamiltonian.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.525
But that means that
this harmless addition

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:40.230
of an imaginary part means
that if you look at the Taylor

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:45.590
expansion, that we are
using now infinite orders.

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:47.835
Infinite orders
in this expansion.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:07.070
So the phenomenological
addition of [INAUDIBLE] gamma

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:10.980
to the excited level b is
actually highly nontrivial,

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.290
because it's
corresponds technically

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:17.600
or physically to a non
perturbative result which

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.455
involves infinite order in the
interaction matrix element.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.850
Question about it?

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.627
So this is more
setting up the agenda.

01:07:35.627 --> 01:07:37.710
I wanted to remind you of
the perturbative result.

01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:40.090
I want to sort of show
you how we can fix it.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.930
I want to show
you what it means.

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:47.530
But with that motivation
I want to now back

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:51.440
to our diagrammatic approach,
our formal solution,

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.080
our exact formal solution of the
time evolution of a [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.500
system, and show you
one how I can implement

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:04.800
this agenda in particular by not
allowing the atom to propagate

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.380
with a naked
Hamiltonian H0, but sort

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.310
of staying dressed with
photons and propagating

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:15.310
with the Hamiltonian H.
Questions about that?

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:31.300
OK, so the derivation
is now focusing

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.139
on two chapters in API.

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:54.455
I need one result which I hope
you remember from about a week

01:08:54.455 --> 01:08:58.140
and a half or two weeks ago.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:03.340
We formulated the time evolution
of the system using the time

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:06.109
propagation operator u.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:10.420
And we found an
exact expression.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.350
I'm dropping all of the
arguments here, t and t prime.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.140
You can look them up
either in the book

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.890
or in the previous
lecture notes.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:20.870
We found that the propagator in
the interaction representation

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:24.399
is the unperturbed operator u0.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.380
Now I need, actually, the terms.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:36.600
It was a time integral
over some time

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:48.120
t1, which involved u0, v, and u.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.649
And I introduced it to
you as you could plug that

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:53.439
into whatever is the
equivalent of Schrodinger's

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.270
equation for the time
evolution operator,

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:58.890
and you really find this
is a solution for u.

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.880
But well, it's not
really a solution,

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.760
because it's a solution of
u expressed in terms of u.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.960
But then I showed you that it
allows an iterative approach,

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.190
and this is why we did it.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.050
If you have a
first order result,

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.100
the zero order result is u0.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.610
When you plug the zero
order result in here,

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:18.262
you get the first
order correction.

01:10:18.262 --> 01:10:19.970
When you put the first
order result here,

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:21.640
you get the second
order correction.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.030
So you get a recursive formula
which solves the problem.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.020
And this is now
our starting point.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.630
This is an exact
formulation of QED.

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:33.040
And this is now
our starting point

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.760
to address the problem
of divergencies.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.390
We want to describe what
many of you do in the lab,

01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:43.740
namely have resonant laser
light interact with atoms.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.880
And I want to show you how
can you describe it with QED

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.460
with the formalism
we've introduced.

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:08.665
OK, now for this chapter we want
to have one big simplification.

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:10.290
Things aren't only
getting complicated.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:11.290
They're getting simpler.

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:20.140
If you have a time integral
which is a convolution,

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:25.180
and you can often simplify it
by Fourier transforming it,

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.530
because the Fourier
transform of a convolution

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:33.080
is simply the product of
the two Fourier transforms.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.240
There is one glitch.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.220
So one subtlety I want
to feed in a moment.

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.480
But let's just
assume for a moment,

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.140
we go from time
before the Fourier

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.160
transform to
frequency or energy.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:56.180
So G of E is the
Fourier transform

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:00.940
of-- after filling a
few corrections of u.

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:06.760
That would mean,
if that were true,

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.850
the equation above
would now be an equation

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:19.080
where the integral,
V sort of constant,

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.340
instead of a
convolution of U0 and U,

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:27.772
we get simply the product of
the two Fourier transforms.

01:12:27.772 --> 01:12:28.855
That's much, much simpler.

01:12:28.855 --> 01:12:31.040
It's an algebraic
equation instead

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.710
of an integral equation.

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:34.510
And remember, when we
get into nth order,

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:37.200
we get n integrals with
some time ordering.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.817
We were able to do it,
but it's mathematically

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:40.525
more complicated.

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:50.815
The problem is that this
is not a convolution.

01:12:50.815 --> 01:12:56.480
It would be a convolution if
the time limits were infinite.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.610
So what we can do instead
is we can define G of E.

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:07.240
Not the Fourier
transform of U. If we

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:15.120
say it is the Fourier transform
of k, which uses a step

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:24.540
function, then if you insert
now k in the formula above,

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:31.130
you see that because
of this step function

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:35.700
we can now take the integral
limits from minus infinity

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.840
to plus infinity.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.200
So therefore, when I say G,
G is called the resolvent.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.280
It's really the
mathematical quantity

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.100
we have to work on now.

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.360
And I wanted to tell
you very simply hey,

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:53.370
it's just a Fourier transform
of the time evolution operator.

01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:54.080
Not quite.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.850
It's the Fourier transform
of a time evolution operator

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:02.380
with a theta function, just
to make sure that formally we

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.845
can extend the upper and lower
integration limits to infinity.

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:11.480
Or this is also a
name-- what I'm really

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.290
kind of discussing are
Laplace transformations.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.860
But I want to convey
to you the physics.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.580
It would take many weeks to do
the mathematical accurately,

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.530
but you can get the idea
and really profound feeling

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:34.100
for how QED works
and what we are

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.660
doing with not so much
mathematical rigor.

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.190
So with that grain
of salt we have

01:14:40.190 --> 01:14:41.990
Fourier transformed equation.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:44.870
We have the Fourier transform
of the time evolution operator.

01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:47.080
But if you look at it
mathematically more exact,

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.330
it's a Laplace transform, and
we are little bit navigating

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:52.225
in the complex place.

01:14:52.225 --> 01:14:55.660
The Fourier transform does
not exist for real values.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.680
We always have to add
a small imaginary part

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.860
to make things converge.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.310
But you've seen that in
many other places, I assume.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.850
OK, so the quantity
which allows us

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:24.170
to describe resonant interaction
in a very straightforward way

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:25.480
is called the resolvent.

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:31.732
I can simply define
the resolvent.

01:15:31.732 --> 01:15:33.190
All I gave you was
some motivation.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:35.390
But if I had
wanted, I could just

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:44.250
say the resolvent is defined
by this operator equation.

01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:46.470
z is the complex number.

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:50.720
H is the Hamiltonian
including interaction

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.940
between atoms in
electromagnetic field.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:16:07.470
And actually if you would
take that-- if you take this

01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:22.450
and plug it into the equation
above-- so if you plug this

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:27.300
into the equation, you find this
expression solves the equation.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.746
So I just want to
say you can forget

01:16:29.746 --> 01:16:32.120
about all the subtleties with
Laplace transform and such.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.360
You can just say let me define
some interesting object.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.450
But it is connected to
what I said earlier,

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.880
because this solves
this equation.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.860
And also I like to sort of show
you the mathematical structure.

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:53.660
If you write the time
evolution operator as e

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:59.890
to the minus the Hamiltonian,
and now you Fourier

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:01.700
transform it.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.460
If you Fourier transform
it, you multiply it

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:11.039
with e to the I omega
t, and you integrate--

01:17:11.039 --> 01:17:14.890
let me integrate
from 0 to infinity.

01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:17.750
There are some issues
with 0 or infinities.

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:23.190
But if you simply solve
this integral with time,

01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:29.240
you have sort of an exponent
e to the i omega minus h.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.780
So if you Fourier
transform it, what

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:41.860
you obtain is nothing else
than the energy minus h.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:46.882
And this looks very different.

01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:48.840
This looks very, very
similar to the definition

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.530
of the resolvent.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:53.400
The only mathematical thing
I'm not fully discussing here

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.980
is z real, or has it a
small imaginary part?

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.140
The small imaginary
part-- actually,

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.710
you have to add a small
imaginary part here

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:05.090
to make sure the Fourier
transform exists.

01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:08.900
But you should clearly see
how things are connected.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.220
So OK, I'm focusing
now on the resolvent.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:15.310
It is equivalent to the
time evolution operator.

01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:17.950
It is a sort of Fourier
transform of it.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.540
And we want to
formally write down

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:27.700
a diagrammatic solution
for the resolvent.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.830
And with that I think
I should stop now.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.150
We start on Wednesday?

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:33.395
Any questions to that point?

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.060
OK, then see you on Wednesday.

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:23.610
IAIN STEWART: So
last time we were

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.677
talking about the subleading
one of our MQ Lagrangian HQET.

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:30.260
Hopefully more people
remember that we

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.620
have a makeup lecture
today, or will not

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.050
be stopped by the snow.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.660
So today we're going to continue
this discussion of power

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.250
suppressed Lagrangians.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.920
And I'll explain
to you why we think

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.195
of these as giving power
corrections to observables.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:48.320
And we'll talk about a
couple different observables

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.650
where these specific operators
are playing an important role.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.280
And then we're going to turn
to the topic of renormalons,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.780
which is fun stuff.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.805
How many people here know
what a renormalon is?

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:01.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.090
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.420
By the end of the lecture, you
all know what a renormalon is.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.650
OK, so this is
where we left off.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.220
We were talking about this
symmetry reparameterization

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.940
invariance.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.110
And what we showed last time
is that the Wilson coefficient

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.410
of this operator is 1 to all
orders in perturbation theory

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.970
because of that symmetry.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.160
The Wilson coefficient
of this operator is not.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.230
And I told you that
at leading log order,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.080
it would be given by some
expression like this.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.720
But in general, this is just
the lowest order expression.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.532
And it gets
perturbatively corrected.

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:36.990
It's actually known
at three loops.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.460
So let's continue.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.530
We've talked about
reparameterization invariance

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.060
for the Lagrangian.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.650
Reparameterization
invariance also

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.020
has important consequences
for operators.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.040
So just like we wrote down
sub-leading Lagrangians,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.110
we should also write
sub-leading currents.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.009
So there's 1 over mq
supressed currents.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.660
And if you look
at those currents

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.463
and you construct them,
then you find, again,

00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:16.880
that reparameterization
invariance

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.080
plays an important role.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.768
And again, there's relations
between Wilson coefficients.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.090
And what happens in
this case is actually

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.800
that the leading order operator
had a Wilson coefficient,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.640
the lowest order operator.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.090
So the Wilson coefficients
of the subleading operators

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.629
get related to that of
the leading operator.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.010
And I may give you a problem on
that on your next problem set.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.650
But I haven't quite
made up my mind yet.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.662
So rather than go
through that, I

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:02.370
want to talk about
some observables where

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.080
these operators played a role.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.563
So we've seen one example of
reparameterization invariance.

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:08.980
And I think from
that one example,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.530
you would be able to
do other examples.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.780
Let's talk about masses.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.720
These operators here
actually have an impact

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.080
on the masses of hadrons.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.120
If we think about the
mass of a heavy meson, h,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.470
there's a heavy quark
in that heavy meson.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.200
So we can pull out
that heavy quark.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.720
And then there's some remainder.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.535
And we can characterize higher
order terms in this formula.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.770
So let me first explain
what this lambda bar is.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.060
Our Lagrangian here, if
we're working at lowest order

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.810
in the theory, our Lagrangian
would be L0 of HQET plus,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.090
for the light quarks,
they're basically

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.475
just a QCD Lagrangian,
so for the light quarks

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.100
and the gluons.

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:09.740
So for the heavy
quark, we have HQET,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.390
and then there would
be higher order

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.973
terms that are 1
over m suppressed,

00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:15.140
which are the ones up there.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.079
So the question is, if
we have this Lagrangian,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.870
what is the mass of a heavy
state like the b meson

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.810
or the d meson or the d star?

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.370
And we can characterize that
by knowing the structure

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.430
of the Lagrangian.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.300
So first of all, what about
this term, this lambda bar?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.257
That term actually comes from
these parts of the Lagrangian.

00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:41.090
So if we take these
parts of the Lagrangian,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.570
we can calculate
the Hamiltonian.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.000
Let me call that H0.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.280
And the definition
of this lambda bar

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:58.537
is the thing that you get
by taking that Hamiltonian

00:04:58.537 --> 00:04:59.870
and letting it act on the state.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.930
So you can think that this is--

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.390
if you like, you can think
that this state is just

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.760
an eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.310
You get the energy.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.360
But since the Hamiltonian has
no heavy quark mass in it,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.260
what you're getting
is some parameter,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.510
which is traditionally called
lambda bar, that doesn't

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.780
have a heavy quark mass in it.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.670
And so there's no heavy
quark mass in here.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.960
So it's independent of mq.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.160
It's also independent of spin.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.120
So B versus B star and
flavor B versus D. So

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.548
whether it's a B
meson, D meson, as long

00:05:52.548 --> 00:05:54.590
as we're in this limit
where both the bottom mass

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.880
and the char mass
are heavy, if we're

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.460
thinking of this
expansion, then this

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.740
is a universal thing
just determined

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.468
by these Lagrangians.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.010
It's traditionally
called lambda bar.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.830
And it's telling you that if
you think about this thing

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.540
as having an order
mq piece, this

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.950
is the order mq to the 0 piece.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.740
The symmetry of the
theory is telling us

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.735
that this is a
universal constant.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.660
It does depend on
the state here,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.030
although that state could
be connected to other states

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.460
by spin symmetry
and flavor symmetry.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.120
There was this quantum number
we talked about last time, which

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.330
we called SL for the spin of
the light degrees of freedom,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.800
and then pi for the parity of
the light degrees of freedom.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.650
So it's the same
within every multiplet

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.220
that we get from a fixed SL pi.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.722
But there's a different
value for each multiplet.

00:07:04.852 --> 00:07:06.560
So you'd have a
different value of lambda

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.760
bar for the B, D, B star B than
for the lambda B and the lambda

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.570
C, for example.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.200
So that's this term.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.680
We can also characterize
what's going on with this term

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.720
by using this
Lagrangian here, the L1.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.660
So at order 1 over
MQ, we can figure out

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.930
what kind of contributions
to the mass we're getting.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.870
h1 is just minus L1.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.060
You can think of it
now perturbatively.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.370
So that just flips the
sign of what we had before.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.240
And we get two parameters from
taking matrix elements here.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.780
They get the following names.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.000
And let me just do
everything here in terms of--

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.068
it's not totally
crucial, but it's

00:08:30.068 --> 00:08:31.860
a little easier to
interpret certain things

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.068
if we work in the rest frame.

00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:35.375
So I'll just work
in the rest frame.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:36.750
So if you work in
the rest frame,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.583
you should just think
of this as like giving

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.500
some kind of measure
of the kinetic energy

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.780
that the heavy quark
gets wiggled by.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.760
And that's called lambda 1.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.040
This, again, is a matrix
element that doesn't know

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.870
about the heavy quark mass.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.260
And the heavy quark
mass in an explicit MQ.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.275
So this guy has dimension 2 if
you work out the dimensions.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.880
And then you can do the
same for the other operator.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.980
And here you have to
think a little bit harder.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.270
And if you think a
little bit harder,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.510
you can characterize
what the coefficients

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.360
are for different spins.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.590
So there's some
Wilson coefficient.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.940
And then we have this operator.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:44.235
And this here is like sigma
dot B. I told you that before.

00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:45.610
And so you should
think of what's

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.300
going on here as you have
sigma, which is giving the SQ,

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.750
and then you have a B field.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.992
And then it's a
question of what vector

00:09:53.992 --> 00:09:56.200
could be left over that the
B field could know about.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.570
And it's basically SL.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:04.750
So this guy here is
leading to the SQ.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.635
And this guy here is
leading to the SL.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.960
And so that's where
this SQ.SL comes from.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.040
So you can think about
other possibilities,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.350
but you have to have
the right symmetry

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.270
structure under time
reversal and parity

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.650
and things like that.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.450
And that forces you
to use a spin here

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.230
for the B and not
something like the V.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.230
So this SQ.SL is something
that you can write out

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.060
as, remembering the definition
of it and its relation to J

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.910
squared.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.270
You can write out
that factor like that.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.540
And then we can derive here
how this lambda 2 contributes

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.410
to the differing
states, because we

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.750
have a different
contribution for the B

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.850
and the B star from
the lambda 2 guy,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.450
because it was violating
the spin symmetry.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.300
So the lambda 1 guy is going
to violate the flavor symmetry.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.160
That's this 1 over MQ.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.840
And so charm quarks--

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.940
charm mesons and
bottom mesons will

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.010
get different
contributions from that.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.250
They have the same
lambda 1, but they

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.530
have a different connection
because it gets suppressed

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.210
by a different factor.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:25.815
And then again for
the lamba 2, Lambda 2

00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:27.690
is a little bit different
because it actually

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.072
has mu dependents.

00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:33.810
That's not quite right.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:39.240
So it actually has MQ dependents
because the coefficient here

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.160
has mu dependents.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.810
So this operator doesn't
have any MQ dependence,

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.350
but the coefficient
does, remember.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.710
The mu dependence cancels
and there's a left over MQ

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.691
dependence to the lambda 2, but
it's logarithmic MQ dependence.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.960
If I define it this way--

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.640
so that's why I wrote MQ there.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.990
So you could, as we
talked about last time,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.962
you could sum up the logs of
large logs and have this guy--

00:12:15.962 --> 00:12:17.420
you could re-sum
logs, if you want.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.295
So you could think of
these as you can re-sum

00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:20.450
logs inside this lambda 2.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.280
So if we ignore those logs or
we imagine that we re-sum them

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.900
and we just look
at the remainder,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.750
then we have the expectations
based on power counting

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.090
for how big these things are.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.740
And we just [? expect ?]
that they're

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.480
both given by the dimension.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.310
And the only
[? dimensionful ?] parameter

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.533
around is lambda QCD
because the MQs can only

00:12:43.533 --> 00:12:45.950
occur in logarithms, and the
Wilson coefficient in nowhere

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.580
else.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.800
And these are
non-perturbative parameters.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:02.162
Lambda bar is also a
non-perturbative parameter.

00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:04.120
These ones have a little
more dynamics in them.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.280
So then we could go out
and write for our states

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.170
the results by putting
these things together.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.550
So we'd have M capital
B plub M little B

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:22.040
plus lambda bar lambda
1 over 2 and little B.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.890
And if we go through the
spin structure there,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:30.410
we get a 3/2 and then
lamba 2 logarithmic MB

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.660
dependence over MB.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.410
So when we start
with the B star,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.980
the first three
terms are the same.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.030
And then this guy
comes in with a plus.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.850
And it's lambda 2
over MB over 2MB.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:03.520
And then the D states
are similar in turn.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:11.800
Lambda bar lambda 1 over 2M
term, and then these two terms

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.330
again.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.218
Same spins, so it's lambda 2.

00:14:17.218 --> 00:14:18.760
And the only difference
is, now we're

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:28.500
evaluating the lambda 2 as
logarithm and charm dependence,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.000
OK.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.430
So there's some formulas
that are correct, actually--

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.490
including all the way up
to 1 over M corrections.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.140
And you can see that
there's still sort

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.580
of a structure to these things.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.310
This is a universal
correction for all of them.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.730
These corrections are
universal between B and B star.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.935
And so the splitting
between B and B star

00:14:45.935 --> 00:14:48.660
is just given by this lambda 2.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.600
That's what causes
the states to split.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.920
So up to that level,
they're the same.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.095
And that's why the B and
B star are very degenerate

00:14:55.095 --> 00:14:56.345
and the masses are very close.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.930
So you can form combinations
to cancel things out.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:08.960
So you can take a kind of
spin average mass where

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.480
you take 3 times the vector
plus the scalar divided by 4.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.750
And if you do that, then you're
canceling out the lambda 2.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.360
And then you can also
form differences.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.800
So if you looked at MV star
squared minus MB squared,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.770
then the only thing that's
causing a difference

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:40.060
is lambda 2.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.860
Numerically, this
is 0.49 GV squared.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.980
And from our formula up
there, it's 4 lambda 2 of MB,

00:15:50.980 --> 00:16:00.020
so something like four
times 0.12 GV squared.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.290
So that's the value
of this lambda

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.770
2 is 0.12 GV squared, which
is about lambda QCD squared.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.555
So our dimensional
analysis is working.

00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:11.680
And then you can do the
same thing for the D meson.

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:17.750
Everything here works
beautifully, actually.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.100
Extract the value
of lambda 2 and you

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:39.130
see there's a slight difference
because that difference can be

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.834
attributed to the logarithms.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.662
So if you take lambda
2 MB over lambda 2 MC,

00:16:48.662 --> 00:16:51.120
then the only thing that differs
is the Wilson coefficient.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.450
So that's something
you can predict.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:17:00.890
So experimentally, if you take
the ratio of those two things

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:06.530
there, you get a
prediction like this one.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:12.148
And if you plug in theory
like leading log RGE,

00:17:12.148 --> 00:17:13.565
then you're getting
alpha S of MB.

00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:17.290
Oh, sorry.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.109
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:23.749 --> 00:17:28.220
And this is 1.17.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.790
So that's for three
light flavors,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.500
which is the right thing to
do for the beta function.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.150
So it's not so bad for a
leading log prediction.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.090
That's kind of the
accuracy you would expect.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.260
All right.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.020
So we're really
understanding quite a bit

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.603
from our [INAUDIBLE]
[? instruction ?]

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:51.280
of this effective
theory about the states,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.570
and even make predictions for
the ratios of the mass divided

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.350
by that as something
preservative, which

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.165
is kind of non-trivial.

00:18:01.165 --> 00:18:03.040
Perturbative up to the
order we were working.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.310
There would be corrections if
we continued in our series here.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.470
There could be some
non-perturbative corrections.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.530
But up to 1 over M,
the ratio of this

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.463
to that, which is what I'd wrote
over there, is perturbative.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.580
All right.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.040
So that's some phenomenology.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.840
It's kind of baseline
phenomenology

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.330
that we can do with
the Hamiltonian

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.770
or with Hamiltonian derived
from our subleading Lagrangian.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.010
There's other phenomenology
that we can do.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.045
And I'll mention some of the
most important phenomenology.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.407
There's another
class of predictions

00:18:46.407 --> 00:18:48.740
that we can make where we
have a lot of predictive power

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.128
by using the effective theory.

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.920
And I want to talk a
little bit about that.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.420
So you can look at
semi-leptonic decays.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.690
And there's two different types
of semi-leptonic decays that

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.430
you can look at--

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.430
so-called exclusive decays
and inclusive decays.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.340
So exclusive is
making transitions

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.580
between the meson
states and inclusive

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.710
is making a transition where you
allow any charm state, not just

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.750
the lowest order
ground state charm,

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.530
but you could have in
this state here, XE, you

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.710
could have a D pi or a D star
pi pi or other things like that.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:37.300
So it doesn't even have to
be a single hadron state.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.600
So exclusive refers to
a particular channel.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.350
Inclusive refers to
some overall channels.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.360
So the theory in these
two is quite different.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.960
In this one, you would have
form factors for the current

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.490
between the states.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.250
And I already mentioned to
you that heavy quark symmetry

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.810
reduces the number
of form factors.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.210
You get this single
Isgur-Wise function.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:06.270
And so heavy quark symmetry
is very powerful here.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:11.760
And you can actually also work
out 1 over MQ corrections.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.240
And people have done that.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.547
And it turns out
there aren't any.

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.270
So there's something called
Luke's theorem, which actually

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.160
was a result derived,
I think, when

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.390
Luke was a graduate student that
proved there was no 1 over m Q

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.400
corrections here.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.470
And then you can work
out alpha s corrections.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.530
And so this kind of--
you can just keep going.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.350
People have worked out 1
over m Q squared corrections.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.360
And this kind of
formalism is used

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.010
to measure V c b because
these decay rates would depend

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.170
on V c b, and that's
kind of what you're

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.180
after if you're doing this.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.160
So you'd like to
parameterize and figure out

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.230
the hadronic physics
as much as possible,

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.110
and aid the experiments
in getting V c b,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.480
and exactly this
framework is used.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.790
People nowadays-- what
they do is, the 1 over m Q

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.950
squared corrections need to
be computed on the lattice.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.195
So lattice QCD computes
those corrections.

00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:03.570
The perturbative
corrections need

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.460
to be computed by
continuum people like me,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.793
so those are computed.

00:21:07.793 --> 00:21:09.210
And they put these
things together

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.260
to get V c b from these decays.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.500
You could also do it
with this inclusive guy.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.210
And here it's more interesting
because you can basically do

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.337
everything with pen and paper.

00:21:27.337 --> 00:21:29.670
So here, you can use an
Operator Product Expansion, OPE.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.780
And actually, HQET constrains
the form of the operator

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.330
product expansion, as well.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:59.110
And indeed, when you work out
the leading power corrections,

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.520
they turn out to not enter
until two orders down.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.370
So again, you're protected
from first-order corrections,

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.380
so you just get corrections that
occur at 1 over m Q squared.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.403
And furthermore, they depend
only on the two parameters

00:22:15.403 --> 00:22:16.195
we already defined.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.830
So it's not like you even get
any new nonperturbative matrix

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.330
comments.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.288
You just get the two we
were talking over here,

00:22:26.288 --> 00:22:28.180
were the masses.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.680
OK?

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.497
So there's perturbation
corrections,

00:22:30.497 --> 00:22:32.580
and there's power corrections,
but you're actually

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.080
not even getting
any new information

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.230
relative to the masses,
any new matrix elements.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.180
OK?

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.100
So we'll talk a little bit
more about this second one

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.642
with the OPE.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.060
There's a lot of
work that's gone

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.850
into this one, both
from the theory side,

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.397
as well as from experiment.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.060
So when you think about
the decay rate for this B

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.780
to X sub c l nu bar, it's a
doubly differential decay rate

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:17.540
in Q squared over the lepton
pair, so that's Q mu, E l--

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.520
because you can pick it
as a second variable--

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.260
and then you don't know
the mass of the state

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.130
X sub c because it could
be different things.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.650
It could be a D. It
could be a D star.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.442
It could be a D pi.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.798
So that's another variable.

00:23:34.798 --> 00:23:36.590
So you have a triply
differential spectrum,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.223
and you can compute it with
an operator product expansion.

00:23:49.638 --> 00:23:51.930
I'm not going to go through
the details of carrying out

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.180
the operator product expansion.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.555
If you want to do
reading about that,

00:23:56.555 --> 00:23:57.930
there's some
supplemental reading

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.712
that I haven't
assigned to you where

00:23:59.712 --> 00:24:01.170
you can read about
that in the book

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.990
Heavy Quark Physics
by Manohar and Wise.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.470
So for our purposes here, let's
think of what operator product

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.817
expansion means.

00:24:15.817 --> 00:24:17.400
It is simply that
we want to carry out

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:35.370
an expansion in
lambda QCD over m Q.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.130
And if you go into
the details, there's

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.630
an important role
played by the fact

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.130
that you're summing
over all states,

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.110
and that's allowing
you to connect

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.350
the partonic calculations to
the hadronic calculations,

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.740
basically by probability
conservation,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.380
but I'm not going to
go so much into that.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.370
So when you do this
operator product expansion,

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.470
you can think of it
in terms of diagrams.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.100
And usually, you draw these
diagrams as forward diagrams.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.380
So here's kind of the
matrix elements squared.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.970
Here is the final state.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.543
There's the b quark going in
and another b quark going out,

00:25:16.543 --> 00:25:18.210
so that's like a
matrix element squared.

00:25:22.194 --> 00:25:24.698
The amplitude squared.

00:25:24.698 --> 00:25:26.990
And you think about doing an
operator product expansion

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.490
for that.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.420
And you match onto operators
in the effective theory.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.790
Just to give you a schematic
structure for those operators.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.860
So there's a
leading-order operator.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.660
There's a
subleading-order operator

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.000
that has an extra
covariant derivative in it.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.560
That's kind of
what you would do.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.780
And then you have
Wilson coefficients.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.600
The leading-order operator
here is just b bar b.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.540
That's what it turns out to be.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.540
This operator here
would look familiar

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.360
because it's D
transverse squared,

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.040
so that's like our
lambda 1 operator,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.520
and that's where the lambda
1's are going to come from.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.187
And then there would
be a lambda 2 term,

00:26:22.187 --> 00:26:24.770
and I just didn't write it.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.852
So there's a magnetic
guy here, too.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.910
So when you look at the
leading-order operator,

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.570
b bar b, that counts the
number of b quarks, OK?

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.930
That's just a number operator.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.680
So to all orders in perturbation
theory, b bar b is 1.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:50.920
Yeah?

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.960
AUDIENCE: How do you cut these--

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.567
like, you're
actually calculating

00:26:58.567 --> 00:26:59.900
[? B to A, right? ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.733
IAIN STEWART: Right.

00:27:00.733 --> 00:27:02.660
So you should think
of actually looking--

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.920
so this is a charm quark.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.160
And so you would write
down that propagator,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.770
and then you have a large
injection of momentum

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.600
from the b quark, right?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.780
Use momentum conservation
and expand the propagator.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.700
Thinking about the
propagator, if you like,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.410
thinking about this
guy here having--

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:27.110
so you could write this guy's
momentum as m b v plus k,

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.650
all right?

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.177
And you would expand in k.

00:27:30.177 --> 00:27:32.510
So at first order, you just
drop all the k's, and that's

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.520
basically giving you this term.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.230
At second order,
you'd keep the k's,

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.970
so the k squared
would be identified

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.130
with this D t squared.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.880
AUDIENCE: Right, but how do you
cut the effective [INAUDIBLE]??

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.850
IAIN STEWART: The effective
theory diagram, it's

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.830
already been cut, if you like.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.260
So this is just a real
thing, and I've already

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.190
taken the imaginary part.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.760
So this is all real.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.140
There's no cut to make
in the effective theory.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.970
The thing I'm
integrating out here--

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.280
so this is a good comment.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.580
The thing I'm integrating out
here is hard and off-shell.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.680
So when I go over to
the effective theory

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.080
and I get rid of the off-shell
stuff, I have a real part here.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.210
There's nothing to cut
in the effective theory.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.657
Sometimes, as you
know, there are

00:28:17.657 --> 00:28:19.240
things to cut in the
effective theory,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.640
but here there's nothing
to cut on this side.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.790
OK, so this is one tall order.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.770
So that actually means
that we don't even

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.750
have a nontrivial
matrix element here.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.790
We just have a
Wilson coefficient.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:44.640
So everything in the first-order
term is completely calculable.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:54.540
No nonperturbative parameter
because of symmetry.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.997
And this guy here is
the power correction.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.630
And if you look at what
the Wilson coefficient is--

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.465
so it's a function of alpha s.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.440
You could think of it
like this, if you want.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.090
And all the kinematic variables,
like kinematic variables

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.070
like these guys--

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:41.890
and it is equal to the free b
quark decay, including the loop

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.750
corrections, of course.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.490
So not only the
tree-level result,

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.170
but adding loop corrections
to the right-hand side here.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.960
If you add the loop
corrections and you

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.300
drop all the k squared's, then
you get just the free b quark

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.923
decay, no nonperturbative
matrix elements,

00:30:00.923 --> 00:30:03.340
so you can just calculate that
first term, order by order.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.380
Just doing a
[? partonic ?] calculation

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.840
gives you the right thing
to describe this decay.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.295
And the OPE is telling
you that that formally

00:30:13.295 --> 00:30:14.420
is exactly the right thing.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.070
Even if you just
started to do it,

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.130
it's actually technically
the right thing to do here.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.360
It wouldn't be the right thing
to do for the exclusive decays,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.510
but it is the right thing to
do here for the inclusive.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.130
So what is the range of
validity of this sort of--

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.740
is there any restrictions on
these kinematic variables?

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.000
And there is.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.505
We're treating the kinematic
variables as if they're hard.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.770
And that means
basically that we're

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.740
thinking that they scale like
powers of the heavy quark mass.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.540
So there can be
regions of phase space

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.820
where that wouldn't
be true, but as long

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:10.210
as we stay away from
those corners, edges, then

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.130
what I said is right.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.980
And it's a little more
powerful than that.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.690
So stay away from edges.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.180
Or there's another way
of thinking about it,

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.890
and that is that you
can integrate over

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.045
regions of the Dalitz plane
for the phase-space variables.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.670
That includes all the
way up to the edges.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:53.770
And as long as the size
of your integration region

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.600
is order m Q, then
you're also fine.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.540
So think of, like,
something with,

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.777
like, m B squared up here,
d m x squared, for example.

00:32:05.777 --> 00:32:08.110
And you can-- it doesn't have
to be exactly m B squared.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.652
It could be m B squared over 2,
m B squared over 4, something

00:32:10.652 --> 00:32:12.880
that you're counting
as order m B squared.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.410
And again, you would be
fine with doing this type

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.207
of operator product expansion.

00:32:20.207 --> 00:32:22.040
So what happens is, if
you restrict yourself

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.347
to be close to the
edges, then restricting

00:32:24.347 --> 00:32:26.180
yourself to be close
to the edges introduces

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.952
new scales in the problem.

00:32:27.952 --> 00:32:29.660
And if there's new
scales in the problem,

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.160
just having a power counting
that separates out lambda, QCD,

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.070
and m B would not be enough.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.670
You would have to
do more detail.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.860
And there is actually
some interesting things

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.737
that happen there,
and we probably

00:32:41.737 --> 00:32:43.820
will talk about at least
one example later on when

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.840
we talk about [? SCT. ?]

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.870
OK, so I already said it,
that there's a nontrivial fact

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.570
happening at NLO.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.840
Well, I already
implied that there's

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.800
no 1 over m b
corrections, and so that's

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.950
an important outcome
from this result.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.430
If you want to derive this,
you need the effective theory.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.280
You basically use the
equation of motion

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.420
to get that to be true.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.610
So this is NLO in the
power corrections,

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:34.520
and then NNLO as I said, is
just lambda 1 and lambda 2

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.880
at order lambda QCD
squared over m b squared.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.180
So phenomenologically, this
is actually wildly successful.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.670
This is-- as far as I
know, this is the case

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.490
in QCD or in any theory
where people have actually

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.140
carried out the operator product
expansion in the most detail.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.170
So people have gone up
to 1 over m Q to the 4th.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.440
So they calculated
at least two loops

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.870
for everything and maybe even
three loops for the [? NF ?]

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.070
pieces.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.969
And experimentally it's
been explored to death.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:17.050
You have these three
variables, and they've

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.050
constructed of order 80
moments from these three

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.690
different kinematic
variables, sliced

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.900
and diced the decay
rate in all sorts

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.742
of imaginative and crazy ways.

00:34:28.742 --> 00:34:30.909
And they've really tested
that this OPE [? always ?]

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.219
works beautifully, OK?

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:36.850
So you can think of that you're
getting a consistent picture,

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:41.270
80 different observables, just
from a few simple predictions

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.520
and your perturbative results.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.570
You also get v c b.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.070
So everything fits together
with the framework agreement

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.840
I've discussed with you, and
you get a result for v c b,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.070
which I'm not going
to write on the board.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:23.580
OK?

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.570
So that gives you--

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.130
I didn't go through the details.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.890
I will give you some reading
to learn more about this OPE

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:32.090
if you're interested, and
sort of [? seize ?] how

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.840
some of the things I
mentioned, like using

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.390
the equation of motion, how
that actually works out.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.840
It's all done very nicely in
this book, Heavy Quark Physics.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.150
But I just wanted
to give you a flavor

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.010
with this effective
theory that there's

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.230
something very useful you can
do with it once you have it.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.280
And in this case, kind of the
main phenomenological thing

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.580
that you're after is v c b and
what I've described to you,

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.560
but you could also
think about b decays,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.210
where you're looking
for new physics.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.900
And again, if you can construct
how the decay rate is looking,

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.660
then you can have
a hope of finding

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.540
new physics in the coefficient
of those decay rates,

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.830
effectively in the Wilson
coefficients of decay rates.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:10.330
OK?

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.760
So we're going to turn
to something else,

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.780
but let me pause and see
if there's any questions.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.660
AUDIENCE: Is this the best
way to [? get ?] [? v c b? ?]

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.910
IAIN STEWART: The two are
actually pretty competitive,

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.770
the exclusive and inclusive.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.320
Basically because
the lattice is doing

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.270
a good job of the
matrix elements

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.210
that you need in the exclusive.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.640
And again, you have a lot
of kinematic information

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.113
you can use from the
experiment on the shape.

00:36:35.113 --> 00:36:36.780
So they're pretty
competitive, actually.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.067
AUDIENCE: Do they agree?

00:36:38.067 --> 00:36:39.150
IAIN STEWART: They agree--

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.690
I think the disagreement is
at, like, kind of the 1.8 sigma

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.980
level, so they agree.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.650
There's an interesting
story in v u b.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.590
So you could do the same kind
of thing, not for a charm quark,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.990
as we did here, but
for a light quark.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.183
And then actually, if
you do b to pi l nu

00:36:57.183 --> 00:36:59.100
and you look at the
inclusive version of that,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.785
and you can do the
same type of OPE--

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.160
a little bit
different, actually,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.248
but you can do it in
OPE there, as well.

00:37:04.248 --> 00:37:05.790
Then you go through
and you get a v u

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.915
b in the two different
ways, and the disagreement's

00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:11.760
at the 2 and 1/2 sigma
level, maybe even-- yeah.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.180
It fluctuates with time, but on
average it's 2 and 1/2 sigma.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.290
[CHUCKLES]

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.320
So that's interesting.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.900
There's not an understanding
of what's going on there.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.220
That's more interesting than--

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.000
this one basically agrees.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.610
OK, so rather than
go further into this,

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.300
I want to turn now to my
promised topic to you,

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.760
to tell you about renormalons.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.260
Actually, renormalons
have something

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.640
to do with power
correction, so it's not

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.820
disconnected from what
we've been talking about.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.560
So what are the ideas here?

00:38:02.523 --> 00:38:04.940
So we've already seen in our
discussion of renormalization

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.340
that there is a
freedom in defining

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.120
the perturbative series.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.570
And we kind of focused
on the m s bar scheme

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.740
as being the simplest thing.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.603
But I told you about some
subtleties with m s bar,

00:38:19.603 --> 00:38:21.020
and now we're going
to address one

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.170
of them that's related to
this thing called renormalons.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:41.090
So we have some freedom, if you
like, in adjusting the cutoffs.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.712
And we had this
cutoff, mu, and it

00:38:42.712 --> 00:38:44.420
was dividing up what
was perturbative and

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.695
nonperturbative in m s bar.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.863
But we could have
done something else.

00:38:51.863 --> 00:38:53.780
We could have used a
different type of cutoff.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.987
We could have used
a Wilsonian cutoff,

00:38:55.987 --> 00:38:58.070
and that would have divided
up things a little bit

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.490
differently.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.940
And you should ask the
question, are any possible way

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.803
of dividing things
up equivalent?

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.790
We've already saw when we
were doing calculations

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.300
that, for the logarithms,
they were equivalent.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.790
But it turns out
that, if you don't--

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:23.270
that the powers, sort
of the power separation

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.080
of power divergences can
actually have an impact.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.830
And that's related to
what renormalons are.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.780
And m s bar and
dim reg basically

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.800
avoids thinking about
power corrections.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.710
You just set them to zero.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.650
And so what can
happen is, in m s bar,

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.500
your matrix elements are
having a little bit too much UV

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.690
physics, and your Wilson
coefficients are actually

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:57.753
sensitive to the IR.

00:39:57.753 --> 00:39:59.420
They're not sensitive--
you don't really

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.087
see it when you look
at the coefficient.

00:40:01.087 --> 00:40:03.230
You just see a number,
and it looks pretty good,

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.455
but there's actually
an asymptotic structure

00:40:05.455 --> 00:40:06.830
to those Wilson
coefficients that

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.050
comes from higher orders
of perturbation theory.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.590
There's things hiding there.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.980
That's what this discussion
is going to be about.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:29.490
So if you do actually
not make a good choice,

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.080
then it can be
the case that when

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.470
you go to higher orders in
the perturbative expansion,

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.210
you get lousy convergence.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:44.280
And that goes
hand-in-hand, actually,

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:50.550
with kind of another thing,
which is harder to visualize,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.180
but I'll explain it.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.640
And that is that you
have trouble extracting

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.476
the nonperturbative parameters.

00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:16.960
And the reason that
you're having trouble--

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.000
so you could think about
doing some calculation

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.710
like that OPE over there.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.650
And you extract a value for
lambda 1 from all your fits

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.652
to all these moments I
was describing to you.

00:41:25.652 --> 00:41:27.610
And then you go to one
higher order in alpha s,

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.420
and you extract another
value, and all of a sudden,

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.795
this guy changes
by a factor of 2

00:41:30.795 --> 00:41:33.050
and you wonder what's going on.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.170
And you wonder, well,
what's nature telling you

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:37.180
about the kinetic
energy if I change

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.638
the order of my perturbation
theory and all of a sudden I'm

00:41:39.638 --> 00:41:43.060
extracting a factor of 2
different value for that matrix

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.170
element.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:47.150
And that's related actually
to this poor convergence.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.520
These things go hand in hand.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.010
If there's pure
convergence in the series,

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:54.940
then when you extract
matrix elements

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.722
you can get different values.

00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:58.180
Phenomenologically,
you can imagine

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.790
how that would be related, but
it's physically related, too.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.730
It has to do with the fact that
there's a poor convergence here

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.740
because you haven't
divided up the IR physics

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.820
and the UV physics
fully correctly,

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.898
and that's reflected
in this inability

00:42:09.898 --> 00:42:11.815
to extract these guys
in a convergent fashion.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.700
And we can actually quantify
that using something

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.670
called renormalon techniques.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:30.010
So one way of saying it is
that, if you make a poor choice,

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.050
you're plagued by something
called renormalons,

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.467
so they're actually something
bad and you don't want them.

00:42:47.932 --> 00:43:02.510
So what goes wrong is that the
short distance of coefficients

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:14.390
have hidden power law
sensitivity to the IR.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.880
You wanted these
to be UV things,

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.520
but they are
sensitive to the IR.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.940
And it comes in dimensional
regularization in the powers.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.030
We've been very careful about
separating out logarithms,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.190
but we weren't as
careful about powers,

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.860
and it comes back to haunt
us if we look carefully

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.490
at the theory.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:44.040
And there's a
corresponding sensitivity

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.020
to the UV in the
matrix elements.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.520
So let me give you
an example that's

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.620
not working through
formalism, but just numerics.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:44:01.040
So let's look at b to u
e bar nu at lowest order.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.460
The up quark is massless.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.522
And we'll think
about this-- like we

00:44:07.522 --> 00:44:09.230
were talking about
for the OPE for charm,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.772
we'll think about it inclusively
so that we can actually just

00:44:11.772 --> 00:44:13.615
look at this and it
makes physical sense.

00:44:13.615 --> 00:44:15.740
The same thing that I told
you about the charm case

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.240
applies for the up quark case.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.790
The lowest-order prediction
is just calculate this guy

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.470
and include loop corrections.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.870
The leading power
prediction is the same story

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.730
as for the charm.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.130
So that means that
physically it's

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.490
relevant to think
about this decay rate.

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.580
So what does it look like?

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.220
There's some G Fermi.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.310
Integrating out the W boson.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.220
There's some factors of pi.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.940
The mass dimensions
of this guy are 1.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.780
G Fermi squared is minus
4, so you need 5 powers,

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.300
and the thing that's the
setting the mass dimensions

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.310
is m b, so you get
5 powers of m b.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:02.480
And if you look at the
perturbative series

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.830
and you said set mu to equal m
b, this is what it looks like.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.340
So epsilon-- I'm
just introducing

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.960
something which is a counting
parameter, and it's 1.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.297
I could also make alpha
s the counting parameter,

00:45:26.297 --> 00:45:28.505
but I actually want to stick
a number in for alpha s,

00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:31.767
so alpha s is going to
disappear in the next line,

00:45:31.767 --> 00:45:34.100
and I'll just keep the epsilon,
which is just telling me

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.310
the contribution is
coming from this order.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:41.090
So you have some choice here
for how you define the b quark

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.370
mass, OK?

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:46.820
You could use the pole mass,
pole in the b quark propagator.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.650
Or you could use
the m s bar mass.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.660
Or you could use some
other definition.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.040
And it's raised
to the 5th power.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.040
So whatever definition
you pick, it

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.243
can be pretty sensitive to that.

00:45:57.243 --> 00:45:58.910
So let me tell you
what the results look

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:04.142
like in three different
schemes for that mass.

00:46:04.142 --> 00:46:06.530
So let's first do
the pole scheme.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.540
This is the same.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.155
We have m b pole
to the 5th power,

00:46:12.155 --> 00:46:14.030
and then we'd write out
what the series looks

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.386
like in that scheme.

00:46:23.427 --> 00:46:25.010
You look like you're
doing pretty good

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.010
when you're at one loop.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.555
You went down by a factor of 5.

00:46:27.555 --> 00:46:29.180
But then you go into
two loops, and you

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.040
find that your
correction at two loops

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.540
is pretty much the same size
as your correction at one loop.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.730
So you say, well,
let's use m s bar.

00:46:44.703 --> 00:46:46.245
That changes the
perturbative series.

00:46:59.993 --> 00:47:02.160
And maybe you think you're
doing a little bit better

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.510
because at least, well--

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.010
(CHUCKLING) but
this guy got bigger,

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.850
and this guy is
bigger than that guy,

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.030
so it's also not really working.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:23.860
Well, if the phenomenology
is as accurate as I told you,

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.840
you must imagine that
there is something that

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.722
does work better than that.

00:47:27.722 --> 00:47:30.190
Indeed there is.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:37.150
So there's other mass games,
and I'll talk about one of them,

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:54.360
continuing this table,
where we switch to something

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.950
called the 1S mass.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.840
Now [INAUDIBLE] looks like that.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.310
We're very happy.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.560
Or at least we're much happier
than we were over here.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.960
So what is the 1S mass?

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.880
The 1S mass is
basically that you

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.470
take half the perturbative
mass for the epsilon system.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:25.350
So the 1S mass is m b
b bar system calculated

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.170
perturbatively, divided by 2.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:39.260
OK, we'll talk more about why
this is working in a minute.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.760
Let me also write down--

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.360
these are conversion formulas
because you calculate the decay

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.955
rate once and for all, so
you calculate the first line.

00:48:48.955 --> 00:48:50.830
Then you know how to
convert between schemes,

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.190
and that's what's causing the
perturbative serious to differ.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:49:02.800
So m b pole is equal
to m b m s bar,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.210
and there's a
series that relates

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:18.220
them that looks like that.

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:24.970
And I could put in numbers here.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.290
And so that's what's
changing the numbers when I

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.040
go from this line to this line.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.353
Basically, kind of the 5
hours of 0.09 that you get

00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:42.520
takes you from here to here.

00:49:50.327 --> 00:49:52.660
We could also think about
switching from the pole scheme

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.680
to this m b 1S scheme.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.805
We have a different series.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.963
It still doesn't
look very convergent.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.170
The numbers look small, but--

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.040
this is supposed to be a 6--

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.040
but this number here is
bigger than that number.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.550
So that when I stick this
series and combine it together

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.130
with this series
for the pole mass,

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.430
then I get that series
at the top of the board.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.160
And the problem is
not in the m b 1S.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.073
The problem is in the m b pole.

00:50:32.073 --> 00:50:33.490
And the problem
in the m b pole is

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.282
being reflected in this
series that relates

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:38.781
them and its poor convergence.

00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:40.948
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
[? what ?] [? m ?] [? b ?]

00:50:40.948 --> 00:50:43.156
[? bar ?] [? being ?]
[? perturbative ?] [? means? ?]

00:50:43.156 --> 00:50:44.740
IAIN STEWART: Yeah,
so you calculate--

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:48.520
so you can think of calculating
the Coulomb potential between b

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.020
and b bar, and that will
give you alpha s corrections

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.610
to just the mass.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:57.700
So you have 2 m b plus Coulomb
potential plus, you know,

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.010
radiative corrections to that.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.750
And you keep dressing it
up and just perturbatively

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:06.910
calculate as if it was a
Coulomb problem, a QED problem,

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:11.942
the mass of the b b bar state,
and then you divide by 2.

00:51:11.942 --> 00:51:15.295
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:15.295 --> 00:51:16.270
IAIN STEWART: Yeah

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:18.060
AUDIENCE: But you just pretend?

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.102
IAIN STEWART: There's
nonperturbative corrections

00:51:20.102 --> 00:51:23.960
to it, but what we're extracting
from it is the series.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.930
OK?

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.990
I'll explain more why
it's going to work,

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:31.330
why this is, like, a reasonable
choice, and we'll come to that.

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:37.270
OK, so the lesson here is simply
that the choice of mass scheme

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.680
has a big impact on the
perturbative series.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.075
And we haven't yet figured
out why some things work

00:51:50.075 --> 00:51:51.700
and why some things
don't, but we will.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.867
It's absolutely crucial
to use the right one.

00:51:58.867 --> 00:52:00.700
Otherwise, the predictions
will not be good.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.730
Well, physically,
we can actually

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:09.250
argue right away why m
b pole is not so good.

00:52:12.928 --> 00:52:14.970
And that's because,
physically, there is no pole.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:20.670
There's no pole in
the quark propagator.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.026
And that is because
of confinement.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.750
So we use this notion of
pole and a quark propagator

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.620
when we're doing
perturbation theory.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.330
But nonperturbatively, it's
not a well-defined notion,

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.340
or at least there doesn't
really exist poles

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.825
in quark propagators.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.460
So it's only perturbatively
a good notion.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.320
So I'll say it's only
perturbatively meaningful.

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:39.290
And in reality, it's ambiguous,
it's an ambiguous notion.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.690
And you can think that the
amount by which it's ambiguous

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:43.460
is related to
hadronization, which

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:47.090
is set by the scale lambda QCD.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.890
So there's an
ambiguity in what you

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:54.230
mean by a pole mass physically
due to nonperturbative effects.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.960
Now, when we set up HQET,
we actually used m pole.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:10.800
So we're using a questionable
physical parameter.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.230
So when we did these
phase redefinitions,

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:18.050
we were actually using
the pole mass scheme

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.249
because we were expanding
about mass shell.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.580
So if you were to
do other things,

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.230
you can think about
getting to other choices

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:42.230
and implementing
them in the HQET.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.790
No problem with doing that.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:54.240
But there does exist
another operator

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.470
that we sort of dropped without
thinking too hard about it.

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:02.580
So if we switch to using
a different mass scheme,

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.860
there's some delta
m, which you can

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:10.560
think of as a series in
alpha s, which we wrote

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.150
on the board a moment ago.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:20.370
And where that delta
m would show up

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:25.410
is that you would have kind of
an L delta m operator, which

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:32.580
would just be exactly delta
m, and then Q v bar Q v.

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.550
That would be left over
when we cancel the masses

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.670
in the Lagrangian, if you like.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.170
That's one way of
thinking about it.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.810
So we have an extra term
in the Lagrangian in HQET.

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:50.360
And now you can ask, well,
if we have an extra term,

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.940
we'd better worry
about power counting.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.440
And it turns out
that the way we can

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.630
understand why m s
bar wasn't working

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:57.890
is related to power counting.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:08.260
So in m s bar, if you
look at what delta m is,

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:13.120
delta m is m bar
itself times alpha.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.100
But by power counting,
you don't want

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.860
something that's growing
with m b in the Lagrangian.

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:25.395
m b is suppressed by alpha,
but it's alpha at m b that is

00:56:25.395 --> 00:56:27.020
providing [? some ?]
[? suppression, ?]

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.840
but that's only 0.2, and
that's actually just not enough

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.600
suppression to get rid
of the big m b here.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.955
You don't get--
you go from 5 GV--

00:56:35.955 --> 00:56:37.580
you know, there's
some number in front.

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.280
Maybe you get down
to 1 and 1/2, 2 GV,

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.130
but you're not getting down
to a small enough value.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:51.830
So parametrically, this is just
not good, both parametrically,

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:57.810
because it grows with m b,
and numerically it's too big.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.470
It's not order lambda
QCD, which would be OK.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.420
So parametrically
and numerically,

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:20.040
delta m is just too big for
HQET power counting in this m

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:20.700
s bar scheme.

00:57:24.268 --> 00:57:27.930
You'd include an operator
that effectively is on average

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:32.720
larger and more important than
your kinetic term because the v

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.930
dot D operator-- v dot D is
counting like lambda QCD,

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.690
and it had v dot D with two Q's.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.360
Now you have something delta
m with two Q's, and if it's

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.790
on average larger,
then you're messed up.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.480
So that's why actually
physically the m b bar

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.440
is not a good choice.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.200
You can think about it from the
effective theory from that way.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:01.213
m b bar is actually
a mass that's--

00:58:01.213 --> 00:58:02.880
you're supposed to
think of it as a mass

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.422
that you use for
high-energy physics,

00:58:04.422 --> 00:58:07.740
for physics really high energy,
above the b quark mass scale.

00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:10.210
Then it's a good parameter.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:13.510
We're now doing physics
below the b quark mass scale,

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:15.880
and this is just
one way of seeing

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.490
why it's not such a
good parameter there,

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:20.740
because the perturbative
corrections are just too big.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.494
So what about this 1S mass?

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.370
So here, it turns out that
if you calculate delta m,

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:37.320
you get--

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.820
in the same way that you think
about corrections to hydrogen

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:44.320
being order alpha squared,
you get m b 1s alpha squared.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.290
And numerically,
that's small enough

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.840
when you put the coefficient in.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.340
So it still doesn't make us
feel very good because it grows

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.655
with m b, but if I just
care about numerics

00:58:56.655 --> 00:58:58.030
and I'm doing b
quark physics, it

00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.870
works because the alpha
squared is enough suppression

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.820
that this is a good
mass scheme, and that's

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.520
why the perturbation theory
treating as order lambda

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.050
QCD numerically, if
not parametically.

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:15.580
Is OK.

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:22.330
Now, if that doesn't
sit pretty with you,

00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:25.008
you can do something
even more fancy,

00:59:25.008 --> 00:59:27.550
and we'll talk about one example
of more fancy a little later

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:31.480
on, where you basically, instead
of having m show up there,

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:36.132
you have some parameter
R, and you have something

00:59:36.132 --> 00:59:37.090
that you can just pick.

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:43.000
And so you could
pick a scheme here

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.990
where R is of order
lambda QCD-- by however,

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:52.600
maybe you pick it be 1 GV or
500 MeV or whatever you like.

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.880
So you can make up a
scheme where this is true,

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.330
and then both parametrically
and numerically you're OK.

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.300
And these schemes also work
just as well as the 1S scheme.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.750
So we can get more
fancy and also satisfy

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:10.290
our formal requirement.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:14.190
All right, so that's kind
of phenomenological numbers

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.300
and a bit of physics.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.140
Let's come back to some
mathematics and talk about what

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.985
renormalons are mathematically.

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:26.418
Is there a mathematical
way of characterizing

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:27.210
what's going wrong?

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.730
What if I didn't think
about this physics?

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:33.550
Could I do a calculation and see
that something's going wrong?

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.900
And the answer is yes.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.030
So first I have to
teach you a few things,

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:43.500
if you don't know them
already, about the asymptotics

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.820
of perturbative series
in quantum field theory.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.335
And these are actually
not convergent series.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:05.580
So they are what are
called asymptotic series.

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:16.020
So what's the definition
of an asymptotic series?

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:22.310
So we say a function has
an asymmetric series, which

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:24.170
I'll write as follows.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.000
Some coefficients.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.100
And we'll just call the
expansion parameter alpha.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.600
You can think of it as
alpha s, if you like,

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.533
but this is just
math, so you don't

01:01:32.533 --> 01:01:34.700
have to think about it as
anything but the expansion

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.720
parameter.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.860
And we say that a function
has an asymptotic series if

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.820
and only if the
following is true.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:52.730
f of alpha minus the partial
sum up to some level n

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:57.110
is less than kind of
the scaling that you

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:04.610
would get from the next term in
the series, which is n plus 2,

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:11.300
for some numbers K N plus 2.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.050
So that's actually a
quite different definition

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.593
than what you would have
for a convergent series.

01:02:20.593 --> 01:02:22.010
For a convergence
areas, you would

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:24.820
say that you could pick
any epsilon you like here.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.660
You could make the N
big enough that this

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.730
would get close to that.

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.520
Here, I'm just saying
that it's less than this

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.480
with some power of alpha.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.100
So imagine that I
pick alpha to be 0.1.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.130
The thing is that this K
here could still grow with N,

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.470
and that actually will happen.

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:43.970
So the truncation
area in some sense

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:46.400
is not being bounded in
these asymptotic series.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.780
And perturbation theory
and quantum field theory

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.370
is generically of
this structure,

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.610
and I'll show you
some examples of that.

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:02.378
It's asymptotic rather
than convergent.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.615
So when you do a
QFT calculation,

01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:19.810
a kind of typical result if
you work out some asymptotics

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:23.080
is that you would have
these fn coefficients that

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.720
are some power of a, and
then times an n factorial.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.510
And that's kind of how they're
scaling as n is getting large.

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:37.930
You can think about the number
of diagrams as just growing,

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:40.180
but even when diagrams
are not growing

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.490
you can get these n factorials.

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:49.630
So that means if you're
fixing alpha as some value

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:53.710
of the parameter, and no
matter how small you take it,

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:56.230
at some order in
perturbation theory,

01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:00.340
you're basically running out
of gas, and your truncation--

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.890
you start to--

01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:08.810
your predictions start
to grow and diverge.

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:11.050
So the corresponding
values of these K's,

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.030
if you had these f's
that were of that form,

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:15.700
would be that the K's
are basically growing

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:18.770
in the same way.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:20.860
So you'd need larger and
larger numbers in order

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.680
to satisfy the definition
of asymptotic over there,

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.660
and having these large
numbers you're never

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:29.320
able to satisfy convergent.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.830
So the series has zero
radius of convergence.

01:04:40.063 --> 01:04:41.980
And then you wonder, why
have we been teaching

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.022
you quantum field theory?

01:04:43.022 --> 01:04:44.920
[CHUCKLES] That's true.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.400
So what do we know?

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.440
Even though these
series are asymptotic,

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.500
we can still make use of them.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:00.500
So typically what happens is
that the series will decrease.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.390
For a while, it'll look
like it's convergent,

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:04.760
and then it'll start diverging.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.770
And you can characterize
where it starts to diverge.

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:12.770
And I'm not going to go
through all the algebra,

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:15.075
but I'll just tell
you some facts.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.220
And so you could
imagine that you're

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.803
doing some perturbation
series, and it

01:05:21.803 --> 01:05:24.240
looks like it's going well.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.050
Things are converging.

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.340
But then, [? some ?]
[? things ?] don't start to go

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.520
so well.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.130
So think of what
I'm plotting here

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.440
as the partial sum
of your perturbation

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:40.180
theory at N-th order.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.860
I sum up all the connections up
to N, so it's like the series

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.620
that I was writing over here.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.730
It's this thing.

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:53.760
Now, in perturbative
QED, perturbative QCD,

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.150
we're never getting
more than a few terms.

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:58.920
So you could say,
well, OK, maybe I

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.840
don't care so much about this.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.460
And in QED, that's
actually the case.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.310
You don't really care
so much about that.

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.020
But in QCD, actually,
the turnover

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.538
happens already around
three loops, and so as soon

01:06:10.538 --> 01:06:13.080
as you start including two loop
corrections this is something

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.038
you have to care about.

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.720
Now, you can say, well,
the best thing I can do

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.990
is stop doing perturbation
theory at some N star

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:24.270
because that's kind of
where it looks the best.

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:27.430
Like, I've gone toward
something in it.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.410
And that actually is
not such a bad thing.

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:32.490
And it turns out you can
characterize actually

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:35.160
the mistake you're
making by stopping there,

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.050
and the mistake you're
making by stopping

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:40.140
there is of the following form.

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:51.670
So it's an exponential
in 1 over alpha.

01:06:55.690 --> 01:07:00.360
So you would never be able
to see kind of the correction

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.420
that you'd need to get to
the correct value, which I'm

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.690
imagining is on the axis
here, in perturbation theory

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.450
because this doesn't have
a perturbative expansion.

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:12.570
And I'll actually show you
that kind of the bad behavior

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:15.990
here and this gap are
related to power corrections.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.390
And they're exactly
related to this connection

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:21.180
that I was telling you between
perturbative corrections

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.510
and large-order asymptotics
and power corrections.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:27.073
This type of
exponential is something

01:07:27.073 --> 01:07:28.740
that we can relate
to power corrections,

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:31.830
and we'll see how that pans
out, although we might--

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:35.110
probably won't get
there until next class.

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:37.950
OK, so this is
kind of a prelude,

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:40.230
and now we're going to
go into more detail.

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:43.050
And it turns out, in order
to go into more detail here,

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:46.050
that, much as you make
Fourier transforms

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:48.240
to explore another
space, we're going

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.045
to do a transform to
something called Borel space.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.940
So it turns out
that, when you have

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:07.870
a divergent series or
an asymptotic series,

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:10.930
there's still degrees
of divergence.

01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:12.940
And we can classify
how divergent

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.479
it is by using something
called the Borel transform.

01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:30.340
Yeah?

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:36.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] will the
series still be asymptotic?

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:39.580
IAIN STEWART: So no, it's not.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.950
Yeah, so 1S mass--

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:43.420
let's see.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:49.902
Yeah, it is still
asymptotic, but it's--

01:08:49.902 --> 01:08:51.819
in a way that I'll
describe once we understand

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:55.960
what this Borel is,
it's much less divergent

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.623
than the other series,
than the pole series.

01:08:58.623 --> 01:09:00.040
If you think about
the pole series

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.479
as being degree-0 divergent,
then this is like a few orders

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.880
down less divergent.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.976
So once we define less
divergent of a divergent series,

01:09:10.976 --> 01:09:12.809
then I'll be able to
make that more precise.

01:09:18.477 --> 01:09:20.560
It's a question of when
power corrections come in.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.420
And if you look at,
like-- so physically,

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.800
the 1S mass is a physical
thing for an epsilon state.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.970
If you look at how power
corrections come in,

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:31.330
then they're suppressed
because there's

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.580
an ambiguity between power
corrections in perturbation

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:33.850
theory.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.260
If the power corrections
are suppressed,

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.069
you have less ambiguity in
the perturbation theory.

01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:38.930
That's another way
of thinking about it.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:41.359
But the answer to your question.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:45.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.430
IAIN STEWART: It
basically affects this a.

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:56.070
All right, lots
of good questions.

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:58.860
Let's see how we get there.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.200
So when I transform, I'm going
to call the transform function

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.920
capital F, and I'm going to
call its argument B for Borel.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.760
And so what's the definition
of the Borel transform?

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.740
We're going to
define it as follows.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.790
There's a first-order
term, and I'm just going

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.220
to put a delta function there.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.080
The real thing that
matters is the series

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.510
of terms that come next.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:27.080
And instead of having F
to the n alpha to the n,

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.970
I'm going to divide by
an extra n factorial,

01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:31.910
and that's the
definition of, given

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.310
a set of F's, how
I construct what's

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:36.410
called the Borel transform.

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:44.980
And because of the n factorial,
I get improved convergence,

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.980
so the n factorial is
making it converge better.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:54.610
So if there's a transform, there
should be an inverse transform.

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:57.820
So here's the inverse transform.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:04.325
It's an integral from 0 to
infinity, b over alpha F of b.

01:11:16.546 --> 01:11:19.930
And that would get
me back to the F.

01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:22.990
So if you have a
convergent series

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:24.650
and you think of
this transform, then

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:26.650
you just can go back and
forth, and you get back

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.930
to the original-- the function
that you started with.

01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:38.000
So if you have some
series that's like that,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.090
you get back--

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:42.920
you could calculate
that series, and you

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.400
get some F of alpha just
before Borel transforming.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.930
If you do this Borel
transform, then

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:51.110
you calculate this
integral, you get back

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:56.510
the same F of alpha from
the inverse transform.

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:08.990
Let me give you an
example that shows you

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:12.710
that, if you have
a divergent series,

01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:15.890
it's not too crazy to define
the sum of the divergent series

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:19.160
by using these transforms.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.430
So I claim that, for
a divergent series,

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:27.825
where F of b and the
inverse transform exist--

01:12:27.825 --> 01:12:29.450
so if we start with
a divergent series,

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:35.480
but these things exist,
then we could just

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.110
use this transform as a
way of defining F of alpha.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.520
So let me give you
a simple example

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.350
of that to convince
you that it's not

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.160
such a bad thing to do.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.785
So let's consider
the following series.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:12.570
Just an alternating
series, but alpha

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:13.820
is a parameter greater than 1.

01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:19.438
That series doesn't converge.

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:21.605
Of course, for alpha less
than 1, it would converge.

01:13:27.368 --> 01:13:28.910
And if I asked you
what it should be,

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:31.202
you would say, well, I
calculate for alpha less than 1,

01:13:31.202 --> 01:13:34.970
I analytically continue,
and it's 1 plus alpha.

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:36.840
Well, that's one way
of getting there.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.890
Another way of getting there
is using this Borel transform.

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:47.600
So if you calculate
it here, F of b,

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.585
you sum up 0 to infinity
minus b to the n--

01:13:52.585 --> 01:13:53.960
once you put the
minus 1 in there

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.820
and there's an
extra n factorial.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.020
So that's e to the minus
b, perfectly well-behaved

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.460
function.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.380
And then you have to do an
interval, 0 to infinity, db.

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:09.500
You could have e to the minus
b over alpha times the F of b,

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.860
which is e to the minus
b, and that just gives

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.020
you alpha over 1 plus alpha.

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:20.580
And this is a perfectly
well-defined interval

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.600
for large alpha.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.670
Large alpha is even
making it better.

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.600
So the integral is
perfectly well-defined,

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.240
and we get an
answer that we like.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:48.960
OK, so this Borel
transform is a useful way

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.095
of dealing with
divergent series.

01:15:01.033 --> 01:15:02.450
The real question
is, what happens

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:04.310
if the inverse
transform doesn't exist?

01:15:13.202 --> 01:15:16.100
And that's what's going
to be the thing that we're

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:16.910
most interested in.

01:15:34.122 --> 01:15:36.330
So if the F of the integral,
integral over the F of b

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:43.620
doesn't exist,
then the integrand

01:15:43.620 --> 01:16:02.820
can tell us about the severity
of the singularities, I.e.,

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.697
the severity of the divergence.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:12.020
And that's the real power
of this Borel method.

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.390
So let's do another example,
where actually things

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:15.830
will diverge.

01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:21.580
So let me take F n to be
a to the minus n, n plus k

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.050
factorial.

01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:26.140
And if we do that Borel
transform of that--

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:32.653
if you have a series,
you can do it.

01:16:32.653 --> 01:16:34.820
And there's only one piece
of it that we care about,

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.403
so I'm just going
to write that piece.

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:52.130
So there's this piece that has
a kind of pole-like structure,

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.840
and it has a pole at b equals a.

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:59.760
And what you say is you
call this pole a renormalon.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.450
This is the renormalon.

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:05.778
You call it a b
equals a renromalon.

01:17:09.235 --> 01:17:10.860
So you're characterizing
the renormalon

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.120
by where that pole is.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.940
A renormalon is a
flavor of a particle.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.998
This has nothing to
do with a particle.

01:17:16.998 --> 01:17:18.540
Usually, you think
of poles as having

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.890
something to do with
particles, and that's

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:21.000
where the name comes from.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.780
It's due to 't Hooft.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.290
Blame him.

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:26.360
[CHUCKLES]

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.780
So if a is less than 0,
your integration contour

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.550
is positive, and the pole
is on the other side,

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:34.340
so you don't have a problem.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.840
The inverse transform exists.

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.945
These are called UV renormalons.

01:17:44.945 --> 01:17:46.820
They still can guide
the perturbation theory,

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.650
and they can be
important for thinking

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:50.150
about why the
perturbation theory is

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:53.420
behaving the way it is, but you
can do the inverse transform.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.300
The real ones that are
kind of problematic

01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:00.080
are a greater than 0
because then the pole

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.505
is on the integration contour,
and we can't do the transform.

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:14.987
So we're integrating d
b from 0 to infinity,

01:18:14.987 --> 01:18:17.570
and we just have a pole sitting
on the axis, so what do we do?

01:18:42.175 --> 01:18:43.800
So you could think
about characterizing

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.200
how poorly behaved a
perturbation theory is

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.330
by looking at these
poles, and that's

01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:51.570
kind of what I meant by having
some kind of notion of how

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:53.730
divergent a series is.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:19:01.215
So you look in this Borel space,
and you look at the real axis,

01:19:01.215 --> 01:19:06.300
and those poles actually
can be on both sides.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:11.490
The most severe pole is the one
that's closest to the origin,

01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:14.130
and that has the
smallest value of b.

01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:17.310
And you can see if you
have a small value of b,

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:20.200
then you're multiplying here
with some large numbers.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.180
So if a was 0.1, you'd be
multiplying by 10 to the n.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.770
So these guys are more severe.

01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:29.100
As you go to larger values,
you get additional suppression

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.860
from this a to the
n, so if a was--

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:34.860
if you went all the way out to
100, then you'd have 1 over 100

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:35.550
to the n.

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:39.100
That's good, but
factorial eventually wins.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.640
So it's still divergent, but we
look like it was a lot better.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.140
OK?

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.530
So you can characterize how
severe the series is diverging

01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:49.540
by the location of these poles.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:55.770
And you can characterize
the ambiguity

01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:58.650
in doing an integration by--

01:19:58.650 --> 01:20:00.972
if you just think
about one pole,

01:20:00.972 --> 01:20:02.430
you can characterize
the ambiguity,

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:05.010
so let's just imagine
there's one pole.

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.570
You can characterize
the ambiguity

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:09.420
by going above or below.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.770
So you have two possible ways
of defining the interval.

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:15.720
You don't know which to pick.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.710
One is to go above.

01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:21.270
The other is to go below.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.140
And then you can think
about what the ambiguity is.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:36.990
And the ambiguity
is the contour 1.

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:38.620
Call this c1.

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:39.972
This is c2.

01:20:39.972 --> 01:20:45.570
The ambiguity is c1 minus c2,
and that is circling the pole.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.220
So you can look at the
residue of the pole,

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.750
and that gives
you the ambiguity.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.440
So what we'll do
next time is we'll

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.900
look at an example
in perturbative QCD.

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:09.780
We'll see that there's a
series that has a renormalon,

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.752
and we'll find it.

01:21:10.752 --> 01:21:12.210
And then we'll look
at the residue,

01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:16.710
and we'll find actually that
out will pop lambda QCD.

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:20.490
So we'll see, we'll calculate,
for some perturbative series,

01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.100
that the pole mass really has
an ambiguity of order lambda

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.460
QCD by using this
technique of going around

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.360
a residue of a pole.

01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:33.258
OK?

01:21:33.258 --> 01:21:35.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] when we
say that the b quark has a 4 GV

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.940
mass, what's the mass?

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:38.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.810
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, so if
you say the b quark has,

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:43.600
like, 4.2 GV mass,
that's the m s bar mass.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.770
If you say it has
a 4.73 GV mass,

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:49.660
that's like the m b 1S mass.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.325
And if you look at how the
PDG measures the b quark mass,

01:21:52.325 --> 01:21:53.950
they measure it in
one of these schemes

01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:55.690
that I'm telling you
about, like the 1S scheme.

01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:57.190
They [INAUDIBLE]
result for that.

01:21:57.190 --> 01:22:00.970
You can convert between the
1S and the m s bar mass.

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:03.550
The m s bar mass is a
perfectly well-defined quantity

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:07.390
it doesn't actually
have a renormalon, OK?

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.530
That's not its problem.

01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:10.420
The pole mass has a renormalon.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.960
The m s bar mass, its problem
is related to power counting

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.730
in the low-energy theory.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.560
It's a good mass for
high-energy physics.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.257
It's a bad mass for
low-energy physics.

01:22:19.257 --> 01:22:20.590
That's the problem with m s bar.

01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:23.050
It's not it's not a technical
problem, that it has a--

01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:27.100
[INAUDIBLE] severity
of renormalon.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.870
It can have a
higher-order renormalon,

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:30.995
but it doesn't have the
same severity of renormalon

01:22:30.995 --> 01:22:32.230
as the pole mass.

01:22:32.230 --> 01:22:34.180
The pole mass basically
has the most severe

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:39.240
possible renormalon, which
is, in some units, 1/2,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.707
so there's an extra 2 to the n.

01:22:40.707 --> 01:22:42.040
We'll talk about that next time.

01:22:45.972 --> 01:22:48.430
So basically, it's the u equals
1/2 renormalons that really

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.677
are causing a problem in
perturbative [? QCD ?]

01:22:50.677 --> 01:22:52.510
because they're the
most important-- there's

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:53.990
higher-order ones.

01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:58.060
Even alpha s actually
has a normalon,

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.760
alpha s in the m s
bar scheme, I suspect.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.420
[CHUCKLES] But even up to
five loops you won't see it,

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.710
or it's very hard to see.

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:09.500
Let's stop there.

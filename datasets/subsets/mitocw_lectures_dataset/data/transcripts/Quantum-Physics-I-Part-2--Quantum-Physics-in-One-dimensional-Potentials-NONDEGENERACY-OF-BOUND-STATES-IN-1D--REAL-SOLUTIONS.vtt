00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.730
PROFESSOR: You first are facing
the calculation of the energy

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.130
eigenstate with some
arbitrary potential.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.110
You probably want to know some
of the key features of the wave

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.670
functions you're
going to calculate.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.770
So in fact, all
of today's lecture

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.900
is going to be devoted to this
intuitive, qualitative insights

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.020
into the nature of
the wave function.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.650
So we will discuss
a few properties

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.830
that help us think clearly.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.210
And these are two
of those properties.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.310
I want to begin with them.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.550
Then we'll do a third one
that we have already used,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.820
and we will prove it completely.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.490
And then turn to the classical
and semi-classical intuition

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.800
that lets us figure out how
the wave function will look.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600
And that's a great help for you.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
Even if you're solving for
your wave function numerically,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.750
you always need to know what
the answer should look like.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.860
And it's ideal if before you
calculate, you think about it.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
And you realize, well, it
should have this t properties.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.170
And if you find out
that those are not true,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.110
well, you will learn
something about your intuition

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.650
and see what was wrong with it.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.810
So we're talking about one
dimensional potentials, time

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.670
independent potentials.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.340
And a first statement
that is very important,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.140
and you will prove in an
exercise after spring break,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.010
and that is the fact that one
dimensional potentials, when

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.280
you look at what are
called bound states,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
you never find degeneracies,
energy degeneracies.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.070
And this is when x extends from
minus infinity to infinity.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.270
You've seen already, in the
case of a particle in a circle,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.210
there are degenerate
energy eigenstates.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.560
But if the potential
extends to infinity,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
there is no such things.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Now what is a bound state?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.590
A bound state sounds like
a complicated concept.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.750
But it is not.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.310
It really means an
energy eigenstate

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.380
that can be normalized.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.900
Now if an energy eigenstate
can be normalized

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.360
and you live in
the full real line,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.670
that the wave function
must go to 0 at infinity.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.000
Otherwise you would never
be able to normalize it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.880
And if the wave function
goes 0 at infinity,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.190
the bound state is some sort
of bump in the middle region

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.740
or something like that.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.490
And it eventually decays.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.900
So this is bound by the
potential in some way.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.680
And that's basically what we
use to define a bound state.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.690
We'll take it to
be that generally.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.090
So this is something,
this property,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.090
which is very important, is
something you will prove.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.040
But now we go to
another property.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.760
We've emphasized forever
that the Schrodinger equation

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.100
is an equation with
complex numbers.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.800
And the solutions
have complex numbers.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.300
And suddenly, I wrote
a few lectures ago

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.830
a wave function was real.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.040
And I was asked, well,
how can it be real?

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.545
Well, we've discussed stationary
states in which the full wave

00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:57.015
function, capital PSI, is
equal to a little psi of x

00:03:57.015 --> 00:04:02.056
times the exponential of e
to the minus i et over h bar.

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:04.405
And there in that
exponential, there

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:08.040
is complex numbers
on this little psi

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.715
of x in front of that
exponential, which

00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:16.380
is what we called basically
those energy eigenstates.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.240
The e to the minus
i et over h bar,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.200
it's understood
that little psi of x

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.320
is the thing we've
been looking for.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.560
And this psi of x solves the
time independent Schrodinger

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.257
equation h psi equal e psi.

00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:37.780
And that equation has
no complex number in it.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.880
So little psi of x can be real.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.200
And there's no contradiction.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.110
Because the full
solution to the time

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.870
dependent Schrodinger
equation is complex.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.340
But here is a statement.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.840
With v of x real, the
energy eigenstates

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.700
can be chosen to be real.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.360
And the words can be chosen
are very important here.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.110
It means that you may find
a solution that is complex,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.630
but you need not stick
to that solution.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.070
There is always a possibility
to work with real solutions.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.050
And what is the
way you prove this?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.250
This I will put
this in the notes.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.730
You don't have to
worry about the proof.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.670
You consider the Schrodinger
equation for psi.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.850
And you show that psi star,
the complex conjugate of psi,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.550
solves the same equation
that psi solves.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.350
And therefore, if
psi is a solution,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.320
psi star is a solution
with the same energy.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.380
That part is very important.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.360
Therefore, if you have
two energy eigenstates

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.510
with the same energy,
you can form the sum.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.300
That's still an
energy eigenstate

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.750
with the same energy.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.970
Even formed in
difference, that's

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.930
still an energy eigenstate
with the same energy.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.890
And the sum of psi
plus psi star is real.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:26.030
And the difference psi minus
psi star, if you divide by 2i,

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.500
is real as well.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:35.720
Therefore you can construct two
solutions, the real part of psi

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.510
and the imaginary part of psi.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.940
And both are solutions to
the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.240
So I've said in words what is
the proof of the first line.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.890
It's that if you have a psi,
psi star is also a solution.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.070
Therefore, psi plus psi
star and psi minus psi star

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.850
are solutions.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:12.100
So given a complex
psi, then psi psi of x.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.102
Then psi real of x that
we define to be psi

00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:24.330
of x plus psi star of x over 2.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.070
And the imaginary
part of the wave

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.500
function 1 over 2i
psi of x minus psi

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:43.660
star of x are both solutions
with the same energy

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.830
as this one has.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.510
So these are the two solutions.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.500
So far so good.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.260
You don't like to
work with complex psi?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.050
No need to work
with complex psi.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.730
Work with real psi.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.820
But here comes the second
part of the argument,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.080
the second sentence.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.260
I want you to be alert
that the second sentence is

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.270
very powerful.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.920
It says that if you have
a bound state of a one

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.050
dimensional potential,
more is true.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:27.540
There are no genuinely complex
solutions in this case.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.890
Any solution that you will
find, it's not that it's complex

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.309
and then you can find the
real and imaginary part.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:40.770
No, any solution that you will
find will be basically real.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.840
And how can it fail to be real?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.930
It just has a complex
number in front of it

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.030
that you can ignore.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.050
So it is a very
strong statement.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.670
That the wave function, it's not
that you can choose to work it.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.400
You're forced to do
it up to a phase.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.470
So how is that possible?

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.310
How is that true?

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.490
And here is the argument
for the second line.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:16.270
If we're talking bound
states, then these two

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:25.656
are real solutions
with the same energy.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:42.380
So now suppose these
are bound states.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.430
There is a problem if there
are two real solutions

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.890
with the same energy.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.330
They would be degenerate.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.680
And property number
1 says there's

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.380
no such thing as degenerate
energy bound states.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.970
So they cannot be degenerate.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.610
So if you start with a complex
psi, and you build these two,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.130
they must be the same solution.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:20.770
Because since there are no
degenerate bound states,

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:26.805
then psi, I will write
it as psi imaginary,

00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:33.510
of x must be proportional
to psi real of x.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.810
And both are real, so
the only possibility

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.300
is that they are equal
up to a constant,

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.160
where the constant
is a real constant.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.110
You see there cannot be
degenerate bound states.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.310
So the two tentative
solutions must be the same.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.510
But that means that the
original solution, psi,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.325
which is by definition
the real part plus i

00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:05.295
times the imaginary
part, is now equal to psi

00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:11.340
r plus i times c
times psi r again,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:17.170
which is 1 plus ic times psi r.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.150
And that is basically the
content of the theorem.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:27.570
Any solution is up to a
number, just the real solution.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.290
So you're not going to
find the real solution has

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.630
non-trivial different
real imaginary parts here.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.550
No, just the real solution
and a complex number.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.270
Now if you want,
you can just write

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:48.460
this as e to the i argument of
1 plus ic times square root of 1

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.540
plus c squared psi r.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.810
And then it's literally
the way it's said here.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:04.620
The wave function is
proportional to a real wave

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.638
function up to a phase.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.000
So that's a very neat situation.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.100
And therefore, you
should not be worried

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.140
that we are going to
have to assume many times

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.470
in our analysis that
the bound states were

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.760
trying to look for are real.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.840
And we plot real bound states.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.430
And we don't have to worry
about, what are you plotting?

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.100
The real part?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.970
The imaginary part?

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.830
Many times we can just
work with real things.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.560
PROFESSOR: So we have
organized three lectures.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.520
And the basic idea
of the lectures

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.120
are to cover some of
the major current issues

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.940
in nuclear arms control
and nonproliferation.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.020
So we have the first lecture
today on India and Pakistan,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.170
which is one of the world's
possible flash points,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.380
meaning that there's a path to
a possible nuclear war, which

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.190
I won't go into Vipin Narang
will certainly spell out

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.440
the case.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.170
But in my view in trying to
decide what to talk about,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.630
this was a golden opportunity
because Vipin is here,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.700
and he's an expert
on these issues.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.440
And I consider this, as I
say, one of the possible flash

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.860
points in the world, one of
the possible conceivable paths.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.610
No path is super likely, if
you want to put it that way.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.740
But the effects of
a nuclear exchange

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.080
are catastrophic both for the
people who get hit, obviously,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.350
because a nuclear weapon--
I don't have to tell you--

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.690
is incredibly destructive.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.260
In Hiroshima, something
like 40% of the population

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.480
was killed, more or less
instantly, burns or blasts.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.890
And probably another
20%, 30% died

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.480
within a year of radiation.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.250
So in addition,
people have realized

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.260
that there are severe climate
effects of a nuclear exchange.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.330
One of the things that happens
with all the burning that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.800
goes on is that soot is
emitted into the atmosphere.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.950
This is the opposite
of global warming.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.290
This is global cooling.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.410
This is like a
volcanic explosion.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.030
And in about 1815, 1816,
there was a volcanic explosion

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.460
in Asia.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.380
And there was a
winter without-- there

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.320
was a summer-- excuse me--
there was a summer without crops

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.560
in Europe.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.380
And there was actually
starvation in Europe

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.155
due to this explosion.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:57.170
It was a one time thing.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.060
The climate models, for
even a limited nuclear war

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.370
in Southeast Asia, show that
this effect would probably

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.870
last 5 to 10 years
and be global,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.810
from roughly 100
nuclear weapons.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.760
So there are papers.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.260
I can give people
references if they want.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.970
There is a paper
in Physics Today

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.470
a few years ago about this.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.370
But there are many
papers on the subject.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.400
So one of the things I want
to say-- so the second lecture

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.850
will be on proliferation
and uranium enrichment

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.140
and the implications.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.310
So these lectures will combine
both technology and policy.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.420
And finally, the last
lecture I will give--

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.320
and it's kind of an overview of
where we stand on nuclear arms

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.120
control and
proliferation-- I'll try

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.230
to fill in some of the gaps.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.440
I'll talk about the
nonproliferation review that's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.260
coming up at the UN next spring.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.033
I'll talk about the outlook
for arms control as I see it.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.990
I want to talk a few
minutes to the students

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.769
because one of the things
that's happened over

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.660
the last few decades, since
the collapse of the Soviet

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.560
Union in about 1990,
people stopped worrying

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.090
about the bomb, so to speak.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.810
Before that, there
was a lot of concern.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.080
Students were asked to duck
under their desks and things

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.780
like that to protect themselves,
which, of course, was totally

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.666
ridiculous.

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:50.700
A wooden desk wouldn't do you
much good in a nuclear war

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700
as you can well imagine.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.880
It'll just probably knock you
on the head with something.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.504
God knows what it would do.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.510
But the issue has
fallen off the table.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.840
And the thing that
concerns people

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.450
more on campus when-- if they
think about global issues,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.740
is climate change
and global warming.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.750
But this is an issue
which has not gone away.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.950
If anything, the probability
of a nuclear exchange

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.420
is higher now than a
decade ago unfortunately.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.300
And we have not
solved these problems.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.170
And there are political
and economic problems.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.130
And I just want
to say a few words

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.950
about some of the
intellectual problems that

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.910
need to be solved.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.550
For example, on a
technical basis,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.220
there are inspection issues.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.850
For example, how do you
inspect whether or not

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.080
a country is cheating on its
nonproliferation obligations?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.080
How do you look for
weapons production

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.680
or enrichment production?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.940
These are very difficult issue,
and they're very difficult

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.380
technical issues.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.350
And then there are
issues in which

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.460
you have to combine
technical issues with policy.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.850
For example, if we're
going to go down

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.720
to a very small
number of weapons--

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.110
as you want to do
for nuclear arms

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.934
control-- then cheating
with a small number--

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:37.350
particularly if
you're going to go

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.310
to 0-- cheating with a small
number becomes a bigger issue.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.620
So verification issues are
very important, reinventing

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.730
the bomb, if you
really want to zero.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.020
So there are all kinds
of intellectual issues

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.410
that need to be worked out,
both historical, technical,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.950
and political.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.370
And there are many opportunities
for research in these areas,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.190
UROP, some theses.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.060
So I just want to
point that out.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.470
And there are also positions
in government and NGOs.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.860
In the last semester, we
had several major arms

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.870
control negotiators
in the US government,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.300
including Rose
Gottemoeller who was

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.880
the chief negotiator on the US
side for the New START Treaty,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.110
said she was particularly
excited to give a talk at MIT

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.810
because we really needed a
generation of technically

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.410
trained people to go into
nuclear arms control.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.960
And she made a special plea,
so I want to pass that along.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:58.110
So I'm going to get
to today's lecture.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:04.110
Vipin Narang, he's a professor
at the MIT political science

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.960
department and the
Security Studies program.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.760
He's got a BS and MS in
chemical engineering.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.120
He's got a degree
from Balliol College,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.250
where I spent a very
happy semester at Oxford.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:29.517
And he's written extensively
on nonproliferation and issues

00:08:29.517 --> 00:08:35.740
of arms control, deterrence,
particularly with respect

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.179
to Southeast Asia.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.049
And he's got a book
recently published

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.720
on regional powers and
international conflict.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.677
So Vipin?

00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:46.510
VIPIN NARANG: Great.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.051
Thanks Aaron.

00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:51.400
Thanks for the kind introduction
and for organizing this.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.880
So as Aaron said,
I'm a professor

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.830
at the political
science department,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.270
and I work primarily on nuclear
strategy and proliferation.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.310
And so what I
thought I'd do today

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.480
was talk about--
give an overview

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.810
of nuclear proliferation and the
consequences of proliferation

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.030
in South Asia, between
India and Pakistan, which

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.030
is-- as Aaron mentioned-- an
active and ongoing conflict

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.560
where the threat of
conventional war is persistent.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.920
And there are periodic
militarized crises

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.260
between India and Pakistan
that put both countries

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.290
at a risk of conventional
conflict every now and then.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.160
And now that both sides, both
states, have nuclear weapons,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.680
the question is what the
likelihood of escalation

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.740
to nuclear level is.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.810
Just as a preview of my
own thinking and writing

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.010
on the subject, I think India
and Pakistan have so far

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.470
been lucky in that the
conventional conflict is not

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.020
yet escalated to
the nuclear level.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.160
But that's not a foregone
conclusion going forward.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.440
I'll talk a little
bit about that.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.100
And it's one of
the regions where

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.130
there is still
active arms racing

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.194
between India and Pakistan.

00:10:03.194 --> 00:10:04.860
And so I'll talk a
little bit about that

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.550
and what the dynamics have been
with the nuclear strategies

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.640
and what the effects on the
relationship between India

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.400
and Pakistan are.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.010
If you have any questions
at all during lecture,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.461
don't hesitate to stop me.

00:10:15.461 --> 00:10:17.210
I know there are diverse
backgrounds here,

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.410
people from different
departments, undergraduates,

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.250
graduate students.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:26.420
I'll go through some basic
theoretical material first.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.072
If everybody's OK
with that, we can

00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:31.780
move through that
pretty quickly and talk

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.417
about India and Pakistan.

00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:35.750
So as I said, India and
Pakistan are both in the process

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.560
of building up their
nuclear delivery systems

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.190
and their nuclear arsenals.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.670
This is a picture of a
Shaheen missile, which

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.860
is a Pakistani long-- it's a
medium range ballistic missile

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.740
in the Pakistani inventory.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.910
And it's based off of a Chinese
export missile, the M-class

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.320
exports.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.490
And both are actively testing
short and long range cruise

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.420
and ballistic missiles as
their inventories are growing.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.750
And that is one of
the concerns, I think,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.790
as we talk about South Asia.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.720
The basic puzzle
though is-- does anyone

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.900
know what these
pictures are from.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.672
So in November, November
26, 2008-- two weeks

00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:19.380
before my wife and I
got married in Delhi

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.615
actually-- a group nominally
a sponsored and based

00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:27.250
in Pakistan, the
Lashkar-e-Taiba,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.890
orchestrated a pretty
daring sea-launch attack

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:37.760
against Bombay where about a
dozen militants, led by the one

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.790
survivor from the militant
group Ajmal Kasab pictured here,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:50.410
sieged the Taj Hotel, the
Oberoi Hotel, the Chabad

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:57.000
House in Bombay and killed over
170 Indians and Westerners.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.012
And the Indian government
was faced with the decision

00:12:00.012 --> 00:12:01.220
about how to respond to this.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.200
This was the third provocation
that the Indian government

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.400
believe was sponsored
by Pakistan since 1998,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.080
the year in which they
tested nuclear weapons.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.390
And the question
facing Indian leaders,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.200
how do we respond
to a state that

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.130
sponsors militant attacks
against our metropolitan--

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.450
or metropoles,
targets our hotels

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.497
and our financial center, when
they have nuclear weapons?

00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:28.080
And the worry in the
Indian government

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.790
was that nuclear weapons had
emboldened Pakistan to sponsor

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.320
these groups who were
perpetrating more daring

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.840
and audacious attacks
against India.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.650
And because Pakistan
had nuclear weapons,

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.649
India didn't have a
conventional retaliatory option

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:43.190
to punish Pakistan
for these attacks.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.024
And so the Indian
government, for a decade,

00:12:45.024 --> 00:12:46.940
has been trying to deal
with what they believe

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.580
is a policy paralysis about
dealing with a Pakistan that

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.390
is more willing to support
militant organizations

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.752
to attack India now that
it has nuclear weapons.

00:12:59.752 --> 00:13:00.960
So brief outline of the talk.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.290
I'll talk a little bit about
basic deterrence theory.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.530
In political science
and in economics,

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.385
the core of nuclear strategy,
both in the Cold War and now,

00:13:10.385 --> 00:13:11.260
is deterrence theory.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.843
So we'll talk a
little bit about that.

00:13:12.843 --> 00:13:14.450
Hopefully, it's not too basic.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.280
I don't need to talk about
the basics of nuclear weapons

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.010
to a physics audience.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.160
We'll go through
it really briefly,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.060
and some of the choices
states have to make

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.059
and how they operationalize
their arsenal, which

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:24.700
are really important in the
India and Pakistan context.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.010
I'll talk about the
causes of and the process

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.930
of nuclearization in South Asia,
how and why India and Pakistan

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.542
acquired nuclear weapons.

00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:33.250
And then I'll close
with the consequences

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.860
and where we are
today, focusing mostly

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.260
on the period since 1990.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.140
May 1998 is the break point
in the India, Pakistan

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.290
nuclear equation.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.510
That's when India, led by
the then BJP government,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.010
tested nuclear weapons,
followed three weeks later

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.696
by the Pakistani government.

00:13:52.696 --> 00:13:54.070
I'll close with
some conclusions.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.280
So basic deterrence theory.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.552
The definition of
deterrence, very simple--

00:13:58.552 --> 00:14:00.010
this is a definition
of deterrence.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.340
This is all inspired by guys
like Tom Schelling, Herman

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.860
Kahn, Albert Wohstetter.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.860
Anybody familiar with
Cold War nuclear strategy,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.068
this will be familiar to you.

00:14:08.068 --> 00:14:11.420
So basic deterrence
theory, in any context,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.040
is trying to preserve
the status quo

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.680
by threatening unacceptable cost
to an opponent or an adversary

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.710
if they do x, some
specified action.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.240
So if you do x, I will do y.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.320
And the idea is we
preserve the status quo.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.460
And the idea is that y, the
punishment that you impose

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.210
on your adversary
opponent, should

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.250
be greater than the benefits
of them achieving whatever

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.380
their objective is,
x, such that they

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.590
are deterred from
undertaking the action.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.150
Tom Schelling used to love
examples with children.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.330
So I have an
18-month-old son myself,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.190
and he's starting to
understand things.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:56.310
And as children get
older, deterrence

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.810
by punishment example
that Tom Schelling used

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.070
was if your child
does something bad,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.480
you punish them by
sending to their room,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.420
denying them dinner, time out.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.640
So there's some punishment
after the fact if they do x.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.760
In another example is if you
hit me, I will kill your mother.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.230
So there's a punitive aspect
to the deterrence threat

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.370
such that the punishment exceeds
the benefit of whatever am

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.950
adversary's objective would be.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.470
So in the Cold War, the
deterrence by denial threat

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.080
was counterforce.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.179
We were going to disarm and
target their own nuclear forces

00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:44.970
to make it impossible
for them to carry out

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.920
their first strike.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.792
So in a case where
somebody's attacking me,

00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:50.250
a deterrence by
denial threat would

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.666
be instead of
killing your mother,

00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:54.290
I cut you're arm off
so you can't attack me.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.040
And presumably, the cost
of cutting your arm off,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.042
so you cannot achieve your
objective in the first place,

00:16:01.042 --> 00:16:03.000
is sufficient to deter
you from undertaking it.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.280
So a good way to think about
this deterrence by punishment

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.660
is we will punish you
with such severe cost,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.987
after you undertake the
action, such that you'll

00:16:14.987 --> 00:16:16.570
have no incentive--
rational incentive

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.280
to do so verses we will
ratchet up the costs

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.760
while you try to achieve the
objective such that you won't

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.950
be able to in the first place.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.825
So I think it's an
important distinction when

00:16:26.825 --> 00:16:30.040
we think about nuclear strategy
even in the South Asia case.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.540
But in the Cold
War, the distinction

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.840
was counterforce
versus countervalue.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.530
So for those familiar with
Cold War nuclear strategy,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.060
when we threatened to
target Soviet cities

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.080
or their economic or
industrial capacity,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.900
that was largely a deterrence
by punishment strategy.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.590
So in the event
that they launched

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.380
a conventional or a first
nuclear strike against us,

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.844
we would retaliate
against their cities.

00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:54.760
The alternative was, and
this was a big debate

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.250
early in the Cold War, in a
case of a conventional conflict,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.312
we would launch nuclear weapons
at their nuclear weapons

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.020
such that they would
not have the ability

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.630
to launch those weapons at the
United States or its allies.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:12.459
So the deterrence theory has
several basic requirements.

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:15.490
We call them the three C's.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.030
So you need to
have the capability

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.010
to impose the threat
that you're promising.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:27.562
So if you're threatening to
destroy an adversary's cities

00:17:27.562 --> 00:17:29.020
in the event they
do something, you

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.519
need to have the
capability do that.

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:33.460
So you need some
explosive capability,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.720
but you also, most importantly,
in the nuclear sense,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.844
need a delivery capability.

00:17:36.844 --> 00:17:38.920
You need to be able
to hit their cities.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.502
And it needs to be
transparent to the adversary.

00:17:43.502 --> 00:17:45.790
It needs to be credible.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.500
And this term credibility and
the concept of credibility

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.470
is what dogged Cold War strategy
and still dogs nuclear strategy

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.910
today.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.730
Credibility is the
hardest part of this.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:02.840
How could you threaten what was
tantamount to mutual suicide

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.000
and have it be credible
by your adversary?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.400
So in the event of-- so in
the Cold War, a good example

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.975
is if the Soviet Union
took West Berlin,

00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:20.100
was it really credible that
the United States would

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.210
threaten to launch
hundreds of nuclear weapons

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.640
at Soviet cities?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.837
The Soviet Union
probably didn't think so.

00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:30.920
So in a deterrence by
punishment versus deterrence

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.260
by denial trade off, which one
do you think is more credible?

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.530
So in the case where an
attacker is coming at you,

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.154
is it more credible
to threaten to kill

00:18:39.154 --> 00:18:43.180
their mother in response
or to cut off their arm?

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.030
What is an attacker
more likely to believe?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.940
It is disproportionate
to threaten

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.600
certain punitive action, and
so it is often more credible--

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.560
and this is where the trade
off between-- the debate early

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.230
in the Cold War about deterrence
by punishment versus deterrence

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.660
by denial turned on the
credibility differences

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.717
between the two.

00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:05.105
That deterrence by denial
seemed to be more credible.

00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:06.730
The adversary is more
likely to believe

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.620
that you would try to stop them
from achieving their objectives

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.680
than to kill millions
of innocent civilians

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.310
that had nothing to do with
the fight in the first place

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.810
after something had
already happened.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.500
And so the United States
ended up threatening both.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.650
And part of it was that
the size of the US arsenal

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.030
made it possible
to threaten both.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.042
But I think there were
many strategists who

00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:34.000
believed that the deterrence
by denial missions

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.100
were still more credible
to the adversary.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.845
But at the heart of deterrence
is this issue of credibility.

00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.220
And the third C
is communication.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.720
The adversary needs
to know that you

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.540
have the capability
and the credibility

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.990
to threaten the punishment or
deterrence by denial threat

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.852
that you make.

00:19:53.852 --> 00:19:55.060
So you have to make a threat.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.945
IT has to be public.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.170
The adversary has to
know what the threat is.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.390
The adversary needs
to know what objective

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.451
you are laying a red line
down for and that you

00:20:05.451 --> 00:20:07.700
have the capability to inflict
the punishment that you

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.200
threaten.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.030
So there's a huge
amount of transparency

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.650
that is required for
deterrence to operate.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.520
Has anyone seen Dr.
Strangelove, the movie?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.410
What's the problem
with the doomsday

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.840
machine in Dr. Strangelove?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.846
There's a great line.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.720
What's the point of a
doomsday machine if you

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.850
don't tell anybody about it.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.790
The adversary needs to know
that undertaking certain actions

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:35.220
will result in some punishment
for deterrence to operate.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.190
So nuclear weapons and--
deterrence, as a concept,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.969
pre-dated nuclear weapons.

00:20:40.969 --> 00:20:42.510
The concept of
ratcheting up the cost

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.000
to trying to deter an adversary
predates nuclear weapons

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.640
by centuries, since
the dawn of warfare.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.470
But nuclear weapons
fundamentally

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.690
alter deterrence equations
for several reasons.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.040
One, the explosive yields,
and as Aaron mentioned,

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.540
even the Hiroshima
bomb, 20 kilotons

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.130
could kill 100,000 people.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:10.760
You could kill cities, entire
cities, with a single warhead.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.430
But more than that,
the missile age really

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.020
changed how deterrence
could operate because, prior

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.000
to nuclear weapons,
what was the most

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.810
destructive military technology
in States' inventory?

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.210
Does anyone know?

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.140
Before nuclear weapons
in World War II,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.214
how did the United States and
Allies and Germany attack?

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:32.380
AUDIENCE: Strategic bombing.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.570
VIPIN NARANG: Strategic bombing
and fire bombing, right?

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.153
And the problem was that you had
to send hundreds of airplanes

00:21:37.153 --> 00:21:42.350
and sorties into enemy territory
to inflict that kind of damage.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.460
So your own pilots and
air force was a risk.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.543
Now, with the missile age,
you can launch warheads

00:21:46.543 --> 00:21:49.350
at no risk to your pilots.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.910
The numbers that
you were required

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.530
to destroy entire cities
were much smaller.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.080
So you could ratchet up
the cost really quickly

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.810
without incurring much
cost yourself in the way

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.850
the strategic bombing and fire
bombing required of a state

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.617
prior to the advent
of the nuclear age.

00:22:08.617 --> 00:22:10.950
And one shouldn't underestimate
the psychological impact

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.320
of an adversary being able
to destroy entire cities

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.250
with a single
warhead, from afar,

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.850
at very low risk to itself.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.930
So nuclear weapons
ratchet up the ease

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.500
of imposing punishment
in ways that didn't

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.970
exist prior to the nuclear age.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.553
So nuclear weapons fundamentally
changed deterrence equations.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.970
Is everyone familiar with
the basics of uranium,

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.053
plutonium nuclear weapons?

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:36.060
So I don't need to go
through enriched uranium.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.682
plutonium from reprocessing.

00:22:38.682 --> 00:22:41.140
Those are basic fission weapons
and boosted fission weapon.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.660
So what is important,
I think, is

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:49.190
most regional powers are
operating-- so India, Pakistan,

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.215
South Africa when they
had nuclear weapons.

00:22:51.215 --> 00:22:52.590
A little known
fact, South Africa

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:57.760
had nuclear weapons
from 1979 to about 1991.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.010
Most states start with
fission weapons, move

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.175
to boosted fission weapons.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.220
The advanced nuclear
powers have fusion weapons.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.700
Most of the United
States' nuclear inventory

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.430
is composed of thermo-- these
are thermonuclear weapons.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.090
So when you think of
the A-bomb, that's

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.590
fission and boosted
fission weapons.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:25.220
The H--bomb are fusion weapons.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.100
The United States has extremely
advanced dial up, dial down

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.890
yield nuclear weapons.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.170
But they're all
thermonuclear weapons

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.720
where there's a primary that
ignites a fusion secondary.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.360
But most regional powers
are operating here.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.030
So North Korea, India, Pakistan.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.250
Israel is assumed to have
boosted fission devices.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.369
But it's possible they
have fusion weapons.

00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:48.910
It's unknown.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.493
They have never
tested or acknowledged

00:23:50.493 --> 00:23:51.525
their nuclear forces.

00:23:54.995 --> 00:23:56.786
Well, Britain is
basically an adjunct force

00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:57.660
of the United States.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.450
They lease their
weapons from the United

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:05.080
States for their tridents, so
those are basically US weapons.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.700
The French have fusion weapons.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.330
But India and Pakistan are
operating in boosted fission

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.000
range.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I mean that's important.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.459
When you can get
to megaton yields,

00:24:14.459 --> 00:24:16.541
you are talking about
characteristically different

00:24:16.541 --> 00:24:17.150
weapons.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.525
The number that
would be required

00:24:18.525 --> 00:24:20.712
to destroy an entire
city are much lower

00:24:20.712 --> 00:24:21.920
once you have fusion weapons.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.650
But obviously, a fission
or boosted fission device

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.160
could do a lot of
damage as well.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.350
But once you have
nuclear warheads,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.784
you're only halfway there
in terms of operationalizing

00:24:33.784 --> 00:24:34.450
nuclear arsenal.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:35.949
I think this is
often forgotten when

00:24:35.949 --> 00:24:38.230
we talk about the
proliferation process.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.380
States need more than
just nuclear weapons

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.517
and warheads-- functional
and reliable warheads--

00:24:42.517 --> 00:24:43.600
to have a nuclear arsenal.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.330
They need delivery
capabilities, right?

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.560
So the first
question you have is,

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.980
how many and what type
of nuclear weapons

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.892
do I want to have?

00:24:50.892 --> 00:24:53.100
India and Pakistan are still
answering this question.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.190
It is unclear how much is
enough for India and Pakistan.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.060
It is unclear how much
is enough for China.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.320
China has about-- it's
estimated in the 200 to 400

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.170
thermonuclear weapon
range arsenal size.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.560
But faced with US
missile defenses,

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.550
conventional counterforce
capabilities,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.300
it's unclear how much
is enough for China.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.400
You need to be able to--
a big piece of answering

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.730
this question is-- a big
concept in the Cold War

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.459
was secure second
strike capability.

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:27.000
So we were worried
about-- the United

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.860
States was worried about a bolt
out of the blue first strike.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.500
You would lose n
number of weapons.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.830
You needed to have enough that
would be able to survive that

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.034
not only in terms of numbers,
but in deployment modes,

00:25:38.034 --> 00:25:39.950
where they were based
and how they were based,

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.060
to be able to retaliate
back with certainty

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.260
against the Soviet Union such
that it deterred the Soviet

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.590
from trying to
undertake what is known

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.590
as the splendid first
strike in the first place.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.070
A splendid first strike being
the ability to fully wipe out

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.660
your nuclear arsenal.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.070
So secure second strike
capability for states is when

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.620
they achieve a level of numbers
and deployment modes such that

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.880
an adversary cannot be confident
that it could fully disarm that

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.280
state's nuclear arsenal.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.440
Other question is, how
do you deliver them?

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.930
So most states
start with aircraft.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.230
You've got aircraft.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.390
You rig them to carry
nuclear weapons.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.855
But what's the problem with
aircrafts as a nuclear delivery

00:26:24.855 --> 00:26:25.355
capability?

00:26:28.805 --> 00:26:30.138
AUDIENCE: You have to get inside

00:26:30.138 --> 00:26:30.950
VIPIN NARANG: Yeah.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.280
You have to penetrate
enemy defenses, right?

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.196
You're not going to get
there without a fight.

00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:38.710
And so it's not the ideal
type of delivery capability.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.140
We have strategic bombers
with huge complements

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.400
of escort aircraft.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.310
They were not survivable.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.820
The advantage to aircraft
is you can recall them.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.540
They're piloted so you
can bring them back.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.570
The disadvantage is they still
have to penetrate enemy air

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.170
forces-- air defenses.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.530
Sorry.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.800
So then the United States
and most regional powers

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.319
are attracted to ballistic
missiles of various types.

00:27:03.319 --> 00:27:04.860
Ballistic missiles
have the advantage

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.840
that you can launch
them from afar.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.730
They have different ranges,
liquid fuel, solid fuel.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.000
It's not risky for the user.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.522
They can't be recalled though.

00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:20.980
But they're different
basing modes,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.580
so you can have land-based
ballistic missiles.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:29.072
We have ICBM silos in
Wyoming and North Dakota.

00:27:29.072 --> 00:27:31.030
You can have mobile
ballistic missiles on land.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.630
The United States
moved quickly to

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.610
sea-based ballistic
missiles, SLBMs.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:41.110
Why?

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.190
Why do you think
sea-based is attractive,

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.690
at least for the United States?

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.820
AUDIENCE: The enemy can't
find them hopefully.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.530
VIPIN NARANG: So in theory,
if your subs are quiet enough,

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.230
they are virtually
100% survivable

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.070
because they're very
difficult to track

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.320
if your subs are quiet enough.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.700
And this was something--
there's an assumption

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.980
that once a state acquires
a sea-based capability,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.360
it has a survivable
second strike force.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.950
That's true probably
in the US case,

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:22.060
but other states' SSBNs, the
sea-based ballistic missile

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.687
nuclear submarines, are not
quiet as the United States is.

00:28:24.687 --> 00:28:27.020
There is increasing evidence
to show that we were pretty

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.330
good at tracking Soviet SSBNs.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.394
We're pretty good at tracking
subs during the Cold War.

00:28:32.394 --> 00:28:34.060
I don't know how much
we track them now.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.900
I mean you have to
assume-- Soviet SSBNs,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.272
as the later generations
became quieter,

00:28:41.272 --> 00:28:43.230
and we're still pretty
good at attracting them.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.980
You can imagine first
generation Chinese SSBNs,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.499
Indian SSBNs are
going to be so loud.

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:51.040
Some of them are
not nuclear powered.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.360
They're diesel
powered, which actually

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.651
helps with the noise signature.

00:28:53.651 --> 00:28:57.825
But it is not
necessarily the case

00:28:57.825 --> 00:28:59.950
that all states that acquire
sea-based capabilities

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.741
are going to have
survivable second strike.

00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:06.080
But this is the attraction
of a sea-based force.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.190
A submarine-based
nuclear force is

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.950
more survivable than land-based
force because land-based force,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.200
with all the [INAUDIBLE]
out there now,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.170
you can track-- you know
where launch sites might be,

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.270
where they may flush
out land-based forces,

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.900
so then you can target them.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.954
Increasingly, some states
led by the United States

00:29:25.954 --> 00:29:28.120
are attracted to cruise
missiles as nuclear delivery

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.530
capabilities, Tomahawks.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:36.320
We have a Tomahawk land and
air-based nuclear version.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.820
The French have an air
launched cruise missile,

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.130
which is a mainstay of their
nuclear force structure.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.240
India and Pakistan are also
looking at cruise missiles

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.210
because they can-- what's the
advantage of cruise missiles?

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:55.689
What's the worry now
with ballistic missiles?

00:29:55.689 --> 00:29:57.230
AUDIENCE: They might
shoot them down.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.230
VIPIN NARANG: So missile
defenses and the advent

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.820
of missile defenses is starting
to threaten the survivability

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.130
of ballistic
missiles, so one shift

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:09.060
is to cruise
missiles, which fly--

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.420
they have lower altitudes.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.410
They can be more
easily controlled,

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.037
so there's more
recallability, I think,

00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:19.120
with cruise missiles than
with ballistic missiles,

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.828
but primarily to defeat
missile defenses.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.140
Third question is, how
do you manage them?

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.920
Some states put their nuclear
forces under military control.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.996
Some states put them under
very firm civilian control.

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.870
This is a question the
United States wrestled

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.510
with during the Cold War.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.300
Initially, the Department
of Atomic Energy

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.744
managed the nuclear pits
in the United States.

00:30:42.744 --> 00:30:44.410
It was under very
firm civilian control.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.530
And then as it became clear
that the United States would

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.960
have to delegate some actual
nuclear forces to the Army

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.390
in Western Europe for
tactical nuclear weapons,

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:01.630
the US arsenal came under
military management,

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.890
but still under
civilian authority.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.040
Other states like
Pakistan are completely

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.414
under military
control, and we'll

00:31:08.414 --> 00:31:11.070
talk a little bit about that.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:14.100
But fundamentally, the
question that regional powers

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.920
in particular have
to face, in ways

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.920
that the superpowers
didn't as much as,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.270
is what are you trying to
deter with nuclear weapons?

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.260
Why are you attracting
nuclear weapons,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.370
and what are you using
them for in your larger

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.450
strategic policy?

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.570
So some states need
nuclear weapons

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.150
just to deter nuclear
use against them.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.320
States, like China for example,
which have huge geographies,

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.210
3 million men under arms,
defense in depth strategy

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.230
aren't really facing
conventional threats

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.380
on land the way that the US and
Soviet Union were facing off

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.870
in Western Europe.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.019
So China and India
both primarily

00:31:53.019 --> 00:31:55.310
have nuclear weapons to deter
nuclear use against them.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.030
So you are worried about
a nuclear armed adversary.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.620
You don't want your adversary
to have nuclear weapons

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.732
and you not have the
ability to retaliate.

00:32:01.732 --> 00:32:03.190
You're really using
nuclear weapons

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.900
to deter nuclear
use against you.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.550
You can then rely on what we
call an assured retaliation

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.980
strategy.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.352
You just need to be
able survive what

00:32:12.352 --> 00:32:13.810
might be a first
strike against you

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.226
and retaliate with
nuclear weapons

00:32:15.226 --> 00:32:18.680
against your adversaries
population centers.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.200
This is your classic deterrence
by punishment strategy.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.232
Nuclear weapons don't
need to be on high alert.

00:32:25.232 --> 00:32:26.940
Retaliation doesn't
need to be immediate.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.452
It just needs to
be certain, and you

00:32:30.452 --> 00:32:31.910
don't need tactical
nuclear weapons

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.820
because you're not using nuclear
weapons on conventional forces

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.000
that might be attacking you.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.380
So this allows for much
more centralized, recessed

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.860
management if that's your aim.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.060
If your aim is to deter
conventional aggression--

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.290
this was the US and NATO
during the Cold War.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.080
We had conventional
inferiority in Europe.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.130
In order to offset the
conventional capability

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:02.050
of the Warsaw Pact
and the Soviet Union,

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.270
the United States
needed nuclear weapons--

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.140
the threat of tactical
nuclear weapons

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.379
to offset that differential.

00:33:09.379 --> 00:33:11.670
And we needed to threaten to
use nuclear weapons first.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.314
If Warsaw Pact nuclear
conventional forces

00:33:14.314 --> 00:33:15.730
came crashing in
a Western Europe,

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.781
the United States
very explicitly

00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:19.530
threatened to use
tactical nuclear weapons

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.860
against advancing
Warsaw Pact forces.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.540
Unlike in the assured
retaliation case,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.220
you can say, look, I have
a no first use policy.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.178
I won't use nuclear
weapons unless you use them

00:33:29.178 --> 00:33:34.370
against me, primarily strategic
weapons, compared to here

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.280
you have a very forward,
aggressive tactical nuclear

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.034
weapons capability
where you have

00:33:40.034 --> 00:33:41.700
to threaten to use
nuclear weapons first

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.074
right because you're trying
to deter conventional attacks

00:33:44.074 --> 00:33:46.040
against you.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.890
And it looks like a
denial and punishment

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.605
mission at the same time.

00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:51.980
And now regional powers are
faced with the same question.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.575
Now, can anyone guess
where India falls?

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.620
Did I say it already?

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.850
Yeah.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.460
Assured retaliation.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.695
They have conventional
superiority against Pakistan.

00:34:04.695 --> 00:34:06.278
They're not really
worried about China

00:34:06.278 --> 00:34:08.780
invading India and marching
all the way to Delhi.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.670
They're primarily trying
to deter nuclear use

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.269
against its own cities.

00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:16.310
Where does Pakistan fall?

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.949
What is Pakistan worried about?

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:21.429
So Pakistan is primarily worried
about Indian conventional

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:22.420
superiority.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.500
And having been at the
receiving end of dismemberment

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.300
from India in 1971,
which I'll talk about,

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.909
Pakistan has
operationalized a posture

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:34.830
that is very aggressive, very
oriented towards battlefield

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.530
nuclear weapons against any
conventional forces that might

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.260
cross the international border.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.310
And so they have a first use--
I call it asymmetric escalation

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.075
doctrine.

00:34:44.075 --> 00:34:46.116
They threaten to escalate
a conventional conflict

00:34:46.116 --> 00:34:52.520
to the nuclear very quickly
because-- or earlier than India

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.570
would-- before any other
nuclear weapons are used

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.760
because they're worried about
Indian conventional superiority

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.920
against it.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.590
Pakistan actually started
its nuclear program

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.720
before India tested the
so-called PNE in 1974

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.720
because on the
heels of the 1974--

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.160
I'll talk about this,
actually, right now.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.190
So India security environment,
historically, so it

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.970
has the 1962 war
with China in which

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:27.527
its conventional performance
shocked even the Indian army

00:35:27.527 --> 00:35:28.610
and the Indian leadership.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.100
The Chinese performed so
much better than the Indians

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.810
in the '62 war, and India
decisively lost the '62 war.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.260
Two years later, China
tested its nuclear weapons.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:49.530
So the Indian military program
gets its motivation, initially,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:54.230
from its experiences in
'62 and '64 with China.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:59.760
And to avoid nuclear coercion
in the future against China,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.870
India hedges under
the Nehru years

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:05.940
and then the subsequent
leadership under Indira Ghandi.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.320
It does also have these
persistent wars with Pakistan.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.390
But it has conventional
superiority,

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.730
and there was really
never any talk

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.720
about needing nuclear weapons
to deter the Pakistanis.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.450
So India had a civilian
nuclear program.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.860
It got a CANDU reactor Canada.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.590
Some of the heavy waters was
supplied by the United States,

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.570
and 54 reprocessing
facilities in '64.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.870
And then in 1974,
Indira Ghandi authorizes

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.480
what's known at the time-- under
the Atoms for Peace program,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.570
there was a category known as
a Peaceful Nuclear Explosion,

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:49.230
which was-- I mean there
are legitimate uses, it

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.710
was believed at the
time, for nuclear.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.900
Like, if you needed to
clear large swaths of land

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.190
for dams for example.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:01.654
And India had some
potential uses for this,

00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:03.070
but it didn't
really fool-- I mean

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.486
a peaceful nuclear explosion
is still a nuclear explosion.

00:37:05.486 --> 00:37:06.970
It wasn't, however, a warhead.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.300
I mean this thing
was a rickety--

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.000
I think was it was eight
meters in diameter device.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.211
I mean it was a hulking,
unstable, rickety fission

00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:19.710
device that they
tested in 1974-- it

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.610
wasn't suitable for
a military program.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.850
It wasn't miniaturized.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:28.600
It didn't have-- it was
even suitable for delivery

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.280
by aircraft.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.010
You'd have to throw it out
the back of a cargo plane.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.960
I mean it still gave
them, certainly,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:44.610
the physics of being able
to sustain fission and have

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.770
spherical compression.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.330
All of that was-- and it
was a plutonium device,

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.630
so it wasn't trivial.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.210
But it wasn't a nuclear
weapon in the sense of the way

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.550
that we think of.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.000
So a lot of work was still
yet to be done after 1974,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.790
but it demonstrated that Indian
scientists had the ability

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.797
to at least design
rudimentary nuclear weapons.

00:38:04.797 --> 00:38:06.380
There are several
explanations for why

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.840
it tested in '74, as
a general security

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.160
environment-- I talked about
China-- persistent wars

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.743
with Pakistan.

00:38:11.743 --> 00:38:15.630
They had just won the 1970
war with Pakistan-- 1971 war

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.696
with Pakistan, which
split Pakistan in two.

00:38:17.696 --> 00:38:18.570
I'll talk about that.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.340
That was the real motivation
for the Pakistani program.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.230
But the real explanation
is a combination

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.750
of domestic politics
and the power

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:27.210
of the scientists in India.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.330
So Indira Ghandi was
facing a potential series

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.120
of losses in state governments.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.350
She wanted a big win.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:41.000
There were several very
prominent Indian physicists

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.200
and engineers who promised a big
boost in her electoral fortunes

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.777
if she tested a nuclear
weapon, and they really

00:38:50.777 --> 00:38:52.610
wanted to test a nuclear
weapon because they

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:53.526
had bee working on it.

00:38:53.526 --> 00:38:55.740
Scientists like to test the
things that they work on.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.740
And they had been doing this
persistently for several years.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.910
And she then found her
opportunity in 1974

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:04.250
when, right before a
series of state elections,

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:05.290
she authorized the test.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.920
Empirically, the
test didn't actually

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.400
help her that much electorally,
but there was a belief

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.712
that it might.

00:39:15.712 --> 00:39:17.920
And so that was some of the
motivations for the test.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.310
From 1974 until about
1989, for about 15 years,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.770
India's nuclear program went
into effective dormancy.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:27.480
There was no high
level authorization

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.890
from Indira Gandhi, or her son
who later became prime minister

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:35.800
after her assassination in
1984, for the militarization

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.150
of the program.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:42.130
So India's scientists
worked on some of the--

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.760
did some of the theoretical
work for miniaturization,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.930
getting India in a place
where if it had to militarize

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.270
a program, it could.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:56.740
But there was no actual physical
worked done on that after 1974.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.610
Pakistan faced a somewhat
different security environment.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.610
So where as India lost
the '62 war and then

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.130
faced China's nuclear test--
but never really faced

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.430
the threat of a massive
conventional invasion

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.470
from China, really
wanting nuclear weapons

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:12.510
to deter the Chinese
nuclear threat, not

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.230
the Chinese
conventional threat--

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.750
Pakistan was really
scarred by the 1971 war.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:26.010
So the 1971 war was the
war in which East Pakistan

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.590
was birthed into Bangladesh.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.750
So there was a refugee
crisis the West Pakistan

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.410
and East-- so Pakistan
at birth, in 1947,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.790
was split non-contiguous
with India in the middle.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.130
You had East and West Pakistan.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.065
West Pakistan was
dominated by Punjab.

00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:43.150
East Pakistan was dominated
by Bangladeshis-- Bengalis.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.780
Sorry.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.670
Later Bangladeshis.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.490
Bengalis.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:51.020
So there was ethnic tension
between Punjabis and Bengalis.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.390
The Punjabis dominated
the politics of Pakistan.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.640
Bengalis felt like
they were second class

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.550
citizens in Pakistan.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.450
That created political tension.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.870
And there was an
uprising in 1971.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.810
India intervened on
behalf of the Bengalis

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.370
to split East Pakistan
off of a West Pakistan.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.090
Now, if you're India, this is a
huge strategic victory, right?

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.950
You had two flanks of
Pakistan surrounding you,

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:19.650
and you were able to make
them two independent countries

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:25.090
with the benefit that you helped
birth Bangladesh from Pakistan.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.590
So it's not like
they would be allies

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.730
against you in a conflict.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:35.080
So strategically this worked
out pretty well for India.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.060
But for West Pakistan,
now present day Pakistan,

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.420
this was a pretty scary moment.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:45.580
Your east wing is
amputated, and it was

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.360
at the hands of the Indians.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.830
So as early as 1965,
when it became clear

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.239
that India might look at nuclear
weapons because of China,

00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:56.780
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was
the prime minister that ended up

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.780
authorizing the program
through the 1970s,

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.032
said "we will eat grass or
leaves or even go hungry,

00:42:03.032 --> 00:42:04.490
but we will get a
bomb of our own."

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.739
It's one of his famous quotes.

00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:08.920
Remember, this was
said as early as 1965.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.030
But after the 1971
war-- in January 1972,

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:16.380
so right after 1971 war, Bhutto
authorizes the nuclear weapons

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.450
program with express intent of
a militarized nuclear weapons

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.520
program to deter Indian
conventional power.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:29.460
So it wasn't because of the
Indian PNE, which was 1974.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.760
Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.830
predates India's 1974 test.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.530
The real motivation
was the 1971 war.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.040
Pakistan could not suffer
the conventional defeat

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.550
at the hands of
the Indians again.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.080
And so Pakistan's nuclear
program was triggered.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.780
For a state that was essentially
desperate for nuclear weapons,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.030
Pakistan tried all
possible avenues.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.985
So you had the uranium pathway,
which was led by AQ Khan.

00:42:58.985 --> 00:43:00.360
Everyone's familiar
with AQ Khan?

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.670
Yes we Khan?

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:03.880
Horrible, horrible joke.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.640
I apologize.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.130
So he essentially stole
the URENCO designs.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.850
URENCO is a European consortium.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.480
He stole it from
the Netherlands.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.520
He worked at URENCO.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.186
From the inside, he
stole the blueprints

00:43:17.186 --> 00:43:20.210
for what ended up being the P1.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.390
And then he modified it
later to be P2 designs.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.170
So he stole the
URENCO centrifuge

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:29.207
designs from URENCO itself
where he was an employee.

00:43:29.207 --> 00:43:30.790
He went back to
Bhutto and said, look,

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:35.590
I can deliver a nuclear
weapons program.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:42.270
And they set up cascades
of the P1s at Kahuta,

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.180
which Pakistan would
deny through the 1980s,

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.510
was a uranium
enrichment facility.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.640
The then president,
General Zia, referred to it

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.300
as a goat shed repeatedly in
interactions with the United

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.230
States.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:03.160
The problem was what
happened in 1979?

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.866
Charlie Wilson's War, anyone?

00:44:05.866 --> 00:44:06.850
AUDIENCE: Iran.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:08.100
VIPIN NARANG: Well, also Iran.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.025
OK, that's true.

00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:12.876
You had the Iran Hostage Crisis
and the revolution in Iran.

00:44:12.876 --> 00:44:16.947
But you also had what
else, December 1979?

00:44:16.947 --> 00:44:18.030
AUDIENCE: Soviet invasion.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:19.730
VIPIN NARANG: Yes,
Christmas invasion.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.810
So the Soviets
invade Afghanistan.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:27.080
And all of a sudden, Pakistan
is America's-- one of the most

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.930
useful countries in the
world for the United States

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.590
because the United
States decides to supply

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.950
the mujahideen in Afghanistan
to fight the Soviets.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.810
How do you get supplies
to the mujahideen?

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:39.520
You have to route
them through Pakistan.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.420
That's when the relationship
between Pakistan and the United

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.320
States flourished because
we really had no option.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.840
History doesn't repeat
itself, but it rhymes.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.210
We did the exact same
thing in the 2000s.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:55.880
And when we were at
war in Afghanistan,

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.790
we needed the ground lines of
communication through Pakistan.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:05.487
And the relationship between the
ISI and the CIA in the 1980s,

00:45:05.487 --> 00:45:07.070
because of the US
role in Afghanistan,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:13.270
became-- what's the right
word for it-- blossomed.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.340
But there was always tension
in that relationship.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:23.570
But due to US nonproliferation
legislation in Congress,

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.720
the United States would
have been obligated

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.750
to sanction Pakistan
and cut off all aid

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:32.934
if Pakistan were to
assemble a nuclear weapon.

00:45:32.934 --> 00:45:34.350
Remember, Pakistan
and India never

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.870
signed the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:40.660
US legislation required
that a state that was not

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.070
a member of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:48.950
found with nuclear weapons--
or who had nuclear weapons,

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.740
would face immediate
sanctions cut off of US aid.

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.700
But that threatened US
operations in Afghanistan,

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.180
so that couldn't happen.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.470
So there was a lot of tension
between the nonproliferation

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.690
hawks at the state
department and the executive.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:07.090
So the Reagan administration
went to great lengths

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:10.430
to play fast and loose
on where Pakistan

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.580
was with its nuclear program.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.230
Everybody knew that Pakistan
had a nuclear weapons program.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.930
But the wording of the
language of the legislation

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:22.930
required-- and it
later embodied in what

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.490
was known as the
Solarz Amendment

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.560
that the US presence
certify that Pakistan

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.610
doesn't have nuclear weapons.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.920
So as long as the
executive-- and the executive

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.030
defined nuclear weapons as the
assembly of a nuclear weapon.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.760
So as long as Pakistan
did not cross that line,

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.640
the executive could
certify that Pakistan

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.000
was a non-nuclear weapon state.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.140
And therefore, the aid and the
relationship between the US

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.340
and Pakistan could continue.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.630
AUDIENCE: When you say
Pakistan, is this so east

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.830
and west are actually
separate countries?

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:57.890
VIPIN NARANG: So
Bangladesh, at this point,

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.431
is an independent country after
1970-- so this is west-- this

00:47:00.431 --> 00:47:02.460
is Pakistan, Pakistan,
present day Pakistan.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.860
And this is with Zia.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.960
Zia is the president general.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:11.740
He executed Bhutto in 1979
I think also, '77 or '79.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:17.240
And he's the present of
Pakistan during the 1980s.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.070
And we'll get through
the-- there's a slow march

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.250
to nuclearization
So '83, there's

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:25.100
some Chinese assistance to
the Pakistani nuclear program.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.530
In fact, on precedent, I think,
in the annals of proliferation,

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:33.070
China transferred--
is now, I think, out

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:38.177
in declassified documents,
the United States believes,

00:47:38.177 --> 00:47:40.510
and i think Pakistan has
admitted, that they received 50

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.610
kilograms of HEU from Pakistan.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:49.230
That's effectively two
bombs worth of HEU.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:54.110
Assuming 25 kilograms
a per bomb--

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:57.900
two bombs worth of HEU
from China plus the design

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:04.300
for uranium core warhead,
known as CHIC-4 design.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.800
It was the fourth test in
the Chinese test series.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.510
So that's 1983.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.370
By 1986, the US is
essentially convinced

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.555
that Pakistan is a
nuclear capable state.

00:48:13.555 --> 00:48:14.930
But remember, it
had it certified

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.150
as a non-nuclear weapons state.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.410
So they were two
screwdriver turns away,

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.660
you could certify them as a
non-nuclear weapons state.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.420
And the executive
continued to do that.

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.269
In March 1987, Zia
complicates all

00:48:27.269 --> 00:48:29.560
of this when he claims that
Pakistan has the capability

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.910
to make a bomb in Time magazine.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.790
So all of the nonproliferation
hawks go nuts.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.950
Here, you have the
president of Pakistan

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:43.810
saying to Time magazine that
Pakistan-- he literally said,

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.360
you could write Pakistan has
the capability to make a bomb,

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360
and they did.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:52.450
And it was then that
congressman Stephen Solarz

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.854
passed the Solarz
amendment where

00:48:54.854 --> 00:48:56.770
the president had to
actually certify Pakistan

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:57.670
not a nuclear weapon state.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.290
But the language he
put in there made

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:03.310
it easier for the president
to be able to say that and not

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:07.404
be lying because the language
is basically nuclear device.

00:49:07.404 --> 00:49:08.820
So if the device
wasn't assembled,

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:12.750
the executive could legitimately
claim that Pakistan did not

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.550
have a nuclear weapon.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.360
Even though it had
the pit over there,

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.480
the explosive package over
here, the assembly over here,

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.210
but it would all be on
three sides of the room.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.670
But you could certify
that it wasn't assembled,

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:29.250
so it wasn't a nuclear weapon.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:32.380
And so by 1988, the
nonproliferation hawks

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.930
had given up, and Solarz
quipped that it had a Saturday

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.760
night special capability.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.610
It may not be elegant,
but it'll do the job.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:46.410
And one of the advantages to
the Pakistani nuclear weapons

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.980
program was, given
the fact that they

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.550
had a tested design
from the Chinese,

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.810
they conducted a series of
cold tests in the 1980s.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.060
But they didn't have to
necessarily conduct a hot test

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.390
to know that their
weapons would work,

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:00.070
unlike the Indians who
were indigenously designing

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.202
their plutonium devices.

00:50:02.202 --> 00:50:04.660
So by the late 1980s, Pakistan
is a nuclear weapons capable

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.160
state.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:11.010
In fact, the War in Afghanistan
ends around 1989, 1990.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.810
President George H
W Bush is president.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:19.210
And as soon as the US stops--
as soon as the Cold War

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.980
collapse-- sorry-- the
Soviet Union collapses,

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.640
President H W Bush
refuse to certify

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.640
Pakistan as a non-nuclear
weapon states anymore.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.955
AUDIENCE: You talk
a out cold test.

00:50:29.955 --> 00:50:31.394
What constitutes a cold test?

00:50:31.394 --> 00:50:33.810
VIPIN NARANG: A cold test is
without the fissile material.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:35.160
So you--

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.760
AUDIENCE: Do they really
know that it works?

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.450
VIPIN NARANG:
Especially in this case,

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.477
it's a spherical compression.

00:50:41.477 --> 00:50:44.060
So they wanted to, as they were
testing the explosive charges,

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.965
make sure they get a
uniform compression wave.

00:50:46.965 --> 00:50:49.090
Because they weren't using--
it's a uranium device,

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.790
but they weren't
designing contact devices.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.205
It was still an implosion.

00:50:53.205 --> 00:50:55.610
It was a uranium
implosion device.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:59.190
And so you could do a cold test
without the fissile material

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.230
to make sure that you had
a uniform compression.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:04.842
So you can do a
sufficient number of tests

00:51:04.842 --> 00:51:06.050
without the fissile material.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:12.400
And since the design itself
was tested in a hot test,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.210
I think the Pakistanis
were quite confident

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.687
that once they had enough
fissile material in the design,

00:51:17.687 --> 00:51:18.270
it would work.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:25.080
So in this period, remember,
India is in dormancy.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:30.920
But there's a-- in response to
Zia's claim in Time magazine

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.820
and several other statements,
India brings its program out

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.740
of dormancy in
response, actually,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.720
to Pakistan's program.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.630
So there's a narrative--
the conventional wisdom

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:45.740
is that India's
nuclear program beget

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.710
Pakistan's nuclear program.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.110
But it's the other way around.

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.710
So Pakistan's
program is triggered

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:52.920
by Indian conventional power.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.780
India has this rudimentary
nuclear hedging program

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.300
in the 1970s.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.030
It was only when
Pakistan claimed publicly

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.010
that it had a nuclear weapons
capability that India brings

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.620
its program out of dormancy.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:09.550
So it was only in 1988, 1989--
it was actually winter of 1989.

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.780
Then Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi orders

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.170
work on weaponization,
miniaturization, production

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.940
line, all the things you need
to have a military program.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.470
And India only is starting
then, at that point, racing

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.940
to develop delivery capability.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.380
So they had indigenous
missiles, the Agni

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.170
and the Prithvi missile.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:30.479
And so India was playing
from behind in this period.

00:52:30.479 --> 00:52:32.520
So it would take India
another four or five years

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.210
before they would have
a militarized program

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.480
that they could test.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.540
Once they reached
that point, there

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.030
were several aborted tests.

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:46.180
1995, Prime Minister Rao
of the Congress Party,

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.710
he is on the brink of tests.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.090
And the US Ambassador,
Frank Wisner

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.912
goes to Prime
Minister Rao and says,

00:52:53.912 --> 00:52:55.120
we know you're about to test.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.142
Don't do it.

00:52:56.142 --> 00:52:58.100
The weight of American
sanctions will kill you,

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.151
and Rao backs off.

00:53:01.151 --> 00:53:04.310
A couple months later, the
BJP, which is the opposition

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.700
party-- the main opposition
party at the time,

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.222
when's office for
the first time.

00:53:08.222 --> 00:53:09.680
They're in office
for only 13 days,

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.305
so they have to pull
back from the test

00:53:11.305 --> 00:53:13.270
that they were
planning to conduct.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.060
When they return to
power in May 1998,

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.930
the BJP, in its
manifesto, says it's

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:19.100
going to test nuclear weapons.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.850
Yet the CIA claims it
was caught off guard

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.475
when they came back
to power after they

00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:24.420
had ordered tests in 1996.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.690
Everyone claims that the
CIA was caught off guard

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:28.550
by the May 1998 test.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:31.595
But the BJP had said it publicly
that if they came into office,

00:53:31.595 --> 00:53:33.780
they were going to test
nuclear weapons again.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.210
And they did take
steps to camouflage

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.450
the activity in the test sites.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:41.730
But as soon as they come back
to office, two months after they

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:46.457
win office in a
permanent majority,

00:53:46.457 --> 00:53:47.540
they test nuclear weapons.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.830
It was five fission devices.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.330
They cited everything
under the sun,

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:53.480
but primarily,
China's the reason

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.646
for testing nuclear weapons.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.674
And then the question
was, how does India, now

00:53:59.674 --> 00:54:01.340
that they overly
tested nuclear weapons,

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.120
operationalize its
nuclear capabilities?

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.250
As I mentioned before, India has
an assured retaliation posture.

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:08.800
So it tested nuclear
weapons in 1998,

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.210
and then the question is, how
do we manage these things?

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.650
India very quickly decided to
have a no first use policy.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.240
And they were going to have
a very assertive management

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.460
of their nuclear forces and
rely on an assured retaliation

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.960
capability, so no tactical
nuclear weapons, just

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.160
strategic weapons.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.680
The capability is
under civilian custody,

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.960
and the aim of their doctrine
is to deter nuclear use

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.789
against Indian
population centers.

00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:34.580
So it's a deterrent by
punishment strategy.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:38.794
And they have long range
ballistic missiles.

00:54:38.794 --> 00:54:40.210
They had some
aircraft capability,

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.900
but they're primarily moving
a missile capability now.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.300
And they have very
recessed posture,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.490
very few weapons on alert.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:52.336
Most of the arsenal is actually
disassembled during peace time.

00:54:52.336 --> 00:54:54.210
Some subset is at higher
states of readiness,

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:58.129
but it's primarily-- it
would take several steps

00:54:58.129 --> 00:55:00.170
up the alert ladder before
India is in a position

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.128
to use nuclear weapons.

00:55:01.128 --> 00:55:05.160
So they're not on
hair trigger alert

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.970
as American and
Soviet weapons were.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:13.020
Pakistan, on the other hand--
so it tests shortly after India.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.660
They have moved away
from uranium enrichment

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.457
to plutonium.

00:55:16.457 --> 00:55:18.915
For the physicists here, what's
the advantage of plutonium?

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.712
Plutonium weapons.

00:55:25.712 --> 00:55:27.107
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:27.107 --> 00:55:27.940
VIPIN NARANG: Right.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.773
So the yield-to-weight
ratio is much better.

00:55:29.773 --> 00:55:34.190
So if you want battlefield
nuclear weapons or higher yield

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:37.770
strategic weapons, and you
have payload constraints--

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:39.820
you're trading off
range for payload,

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.760
so a plutonium gets you much
better yield-to-weight ratios.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.630
So it is about 4 to 1 advantage.

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:51.520
And once they had
the uranium devices,

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.320
they're worried--
Pakistan was always

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.780
worried that India would
attack its nuclear facilities.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.840
Once it acquired basic
nuclear weapons capability

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.264
through the uranium pathway, now
it doesn't fear that as much.

00:56:02.264 --> 00:56:04.680
And so most of the plutonium
production is out in the open

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.626
and with Chinese help.

00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:07.250
So there are series
of Chinese reactors

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.170
and reprocessing facilities
that are coming on line.

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:13.850
And Pakistan is shifting
to plutonium production,

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:17.392
primarily for its battlefield
nuclear weapons capability.

00:56:17.392 --> 00:56:19.100
It's delivery capabilities
were initially

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.020
bought from China
and North Korea,

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:24.000
so there were missiles for
uranium enrichment capability

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.800
trade that Pakistan had with
China-- sorry-- with North

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.721
Korea.

00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:30.720
So it got the No-Dong
missiles from North Korea.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.430
In exchange, North
Korea got some basis

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:37.670
for its uranium enrichment
capability that it now has.

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:44.390
And China also sold
Pakistan some MX-4 missiles,

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:48.137
which are the Shaheen and
Gaznavi missiles for Pakistan.

00:56:48.137 --> 00:56:50.553
AUDIENCE: What's the motivation
for China to sell and give

00:56:50.553 --> 00:56:52.110
this aid to Pakistan?

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.026
VIPIN NARANG: Well, so
if you're China, what's

00:56:54.026 --> 00:56:55.920
the advantage of having
Pakistan be nuclear

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.220
and-- who's in the middle?

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.920
Look at thee-- They can
sandwich India, right?

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.610
So the enemy of my
enemy is my friend.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:08.485
AUDIENCE: I mean it seams China
had their own nuclear weapons,

00:57:08.485 --> 00:57:11.922
so anything from Pakistan
would be trivial.

00:57:11.922 --> 00:57:13.395
Pakistan's a little unstable.

00:57:13.395 --> 00:57:17.570
You never quite know if the
government collapses, what

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:18.820
might happen to those weapons.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.430
VIPIN NARANG: No, I mean these
are all reasonable questions.

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:22.430
And I think they're raised
of the Chinese a lot.

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.530
Like that you provide a
state a nuclear capability

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:29.320
or assist them, but you don't
want to take responsibility

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.250
if there's a fracture in the
state and nuclear weapons

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.350
fall into extremist hands.

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:37.050
And the Chinese
will always-- you

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:39.330
go to some of these Track
IIs and China has always

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:40.800
washed their hands of it.

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.787
But you can think from
a strategic perspective

00:57:42.787 --> 00:57:45.370
why it makes sense for them to
have India focused on Pakistan,

00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:46.453
and this is one way to do.

00:57:46.453 --> 00:57:50.090
And I think that's the
Chinese motivation.

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:54.010
So Pakistan,
because it is trying

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:56.120
to deter Indian
conventional power,

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.510
has an explicit
first use doctrine.

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:04.460
And this has evolved in
the past 15, 16 years.

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:07.635
First of all, it's
credible because all

00:58:07.635 --> 00:58:10.290
of Pakistan's nuclear weapons
are under military custody.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.450
Unlike India where the
civilian custody and control

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:15.340
of nuclear weapons, Pakistan
is a de facto praetorian state.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.300
The Army is a dominant
decision making body.

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.010
And so all the nuclear weapons
program, from cradle to grave,

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.060
is under army management.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.910
So they control the
nuclear weapons program.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.870
There's been a shift to
battlefield nuclear weapons.

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:30.460
There's a capability
known as the NASR missile.

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.650
If anyone's been following
this, it's a 60 kilometer,

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:40.340
short range nuclear
weapon system

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.965
that will be fielded at the
rear edge of battle that

00:58:42.965 --> 00:58:44.970
would target Indian
forces if they

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:46.772
cross the international border.

00:58:46.772 --> 00:58:48.980
They have a series of cruise
missiles, which are also

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.188
designed to be battlefield
nuclear weapons, the Ra'ad

00:58:51.188 --> 00:58:51.880
and the Babur.

00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.435
And they have an explicitly
deterrence by denial mission.

00:58:54.435 --> 00:58:56.560
They're trying to deter
Indian conventional attacks

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.270
across the international border.

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:06.690
So there are some--
any questions

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:11.770
about where we are in terms of
how India and Pakistan think

00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:13.870
about nuclear weapons
in their force postures?

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.160
Yeah?

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.435
AUDIENCE: Around that time
was India suggesting at all

00:59:16.435 --> 00:59:19.454
that that they were
interested in traditional war

00:59:19.454 --> 00:59:20.110
with Pakistan?

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:20.970
VIPIN NARANG: So this is
an excellent question.

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:23.660
Why would Pakistan-- I'll
skip through some of this

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:28.480
because the crux of the
problem now is India

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.040
doesn't have any territorial
designs on Pakistan.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.320
Why would India want to
dismember Pakistani further?

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.410
It prefers a stable Pakistan.

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.400
It has no territorial
ambitions in Pakistan.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.230
There are some-- Kashmir
is a disputed-- there's

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:42.610
a dispute over Kashmir.

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:45.540
But frankly, the line
of control on both sides

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.860
is effectively the
de facto border.

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.171
There won't be much territorial
revision over Kashmir.

00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.670
And certainly, if you're worried
about a conventional attack

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:58.180
across the international
border, how do you get there?

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:02.290
I'll get to that in one second
after very quickly talking

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:05.080
about, in the
nuclear sense, what

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.640
the difference is between
South Asian the Cold War.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.810
So both sides now
have nuclear weapons.

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:12.200
Some of the key differences
between India, Pakistan,

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.990
and the United States
and the Soviet Union

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:18.300
are, one, rudimentary
capabilities still,

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.860
organizational
command and control

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.830
is not as mature in either
country as in the Cold

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:27.630
War, especially in the later
years the Cold War obviously.

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:30.540
But the other big difference
is they border each other.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.500
So the flight times
between India and Pakistan

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.700
is on the order of
a couple minutes.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.990
The US and Soviet
Union was 30 minutes.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:42.504
So you had a half hour to
figure what was going on.

01:00:42.504 --> 01:00:45.540
In India and Pakistan,
you have two minutes--

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.040
if you had any early warning--
and early warning systems are

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.720
very rudimentary-- if you
had any early warning,

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.610
or indication that the
other side is launching

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.160
a potential nuclear strike,
you have two minutes

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.800
before that thing
is going to hit.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.860
So your reaction times
have to be much quicker.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.790
The other big difference
is-- I'm going

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.800
to skip through this here.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.380
The other big difference
is, as you mentioned,

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.820
why would India be interested
in conventional attacks

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.154
against Pakistan?

01:01:12.154 --> 01:01:13.820
Well, it wouldn't be
ab-- it wouldn't be

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.180
the first to initiate conflict.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.070
The Indian problem
right now is it

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.580
is facing a Pakistan that is
more aggressively emboldened

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.880
to launch militant attacks
in India using organization--

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.990
proxy organization
sponsored by the state--

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.830
or believed to be
sponsored by the state,

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.340
like Lushkar-e-Taiba,
Jaish-e-Mohammed.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.722
And the strategy has
changed since Pakistan

01:01:33.722 --> 01:01:34.680
tested nuclear weapons.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:40.020
Prior to 1998, Pakistan--
there was a strategy,

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.410
coined by Zia and
General Aslam Baig,

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:46.040
known as bleeding
India by 1,000 cuts.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.730
So there's a strategy of
cutting India at the periphery.

01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:51.495
In the line of control in
Jammu Kashmir in the mountains,

01:01:51.495 --> 01:01:53.370
you couldn't have a real
conventional battle,

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.120
but you could have
terrorist infiltration.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.800
There would be some attacks
and just small cuts.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.720
But the strategy has shifted
since 1998, it seems.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.860
The frequency of
over infiltration

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:09.250
by regular forces in
the Kargil War in 1999

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:13.200
and then multiple attacks on
Indian metropolitan cities

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.892
with these Pakistan-based
militant organizations.

01:02:16.892 --> 01:02:18.350
It leads to a
condition where India

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.820
wouldn't be starting a war,
but it would be retaliating.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.620
So India's mainstay threat
prior to nuclearization

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.512
was if you try the strategy of
bleeding us by a thousand cuts,

01:02:27.512 --> 01:02:29.220
we're going to punish
you where it hurts.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.720
We're going to
destroy your army.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.169
If you're an army led state,
an army controlled state,

01:02:34.169 --> 01:02:35.710
we'll cross the
international border,

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.890
and we will attrit your army.

01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:39.609
And that will punish Pakistan.

01:02:39.609 --> 01:02:41.650
So that was the deterrence
by punishment strategy

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:45.050
India had at the conventional
level prior to nuclearization.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:48.520
But post-nuclearization
now Pakistan is doing what?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.530
It threatens-- well, it's going
to stand and fight for a while.

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.290
But in extreme, it threatens
tactical nuclear use

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.780
on Indian forces if
India tries to retaliate

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.570
across the international border.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.900
And so that's the scenario
that India finds itself now.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.310
And that's the
scenario in which India

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:04.560
would think about conventional
conflict with Pakistan.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.129
It's not for
territorial ambition

01:03:06.129 --> 01:03:07.170
or any territorial gains.

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:10.810
It would be for retaliation
after a provocation.

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:14.070
So there are a couple examples.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.470
The first is the Kargil War.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.450
Does anyone remember
this, May 1999?

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:24.320
So this was a year after
they tested nuclear weapons.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.920
General Pervez Musharraf,
who ended up being president

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.630
during the first phase of
the Afghan war in 2000-- this

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:36.540
was right before September--
two years before September 11.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.760
Nawaz Sharif-- man history
does repeat itself.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.190
Nawaz Sharif was then
the prime minister.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:46.230
He is again the prime
minister today by the way.

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:48.230
He claims he had no
knowledge of this operation.

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:50.040
But then General
Pervez Musharraf,

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.750
who was the chief of army
staff, orchestrated an operation

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:56.780
where un-uniformed regular
Pakistan forces, known

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.610
as the Northern Light Infiltry--
the Northern Light Infantry,

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:04.190
infiltrated into several sectors
in to Indian held Kashmir,

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:05.240
into Indian territory.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.610
And India responded
with trying to dislodge

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:11.460
the Pakistani forces.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.800
Previously, this exact operation
had been attempted in 1965.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.070
India launched air strikes
across the line of control

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:21.270
and opened a second front
across the international border.

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.850
This, time the BJP
responded very differently.

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.870
Because of Pakistan's
nuclearization,

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:32.510
the BJP was much more restrained
and sustained heavier losses

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:36.510
because the threat of
escalating the conflict

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.920
deterred the BJP from
the same kind of response

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.230
that it had in 1965--
that India had.

01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:44.950
So it refused to
allow air operations

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:46.650
across the line of control.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.860
So Indian aircraft could not
cross the line of control

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.064
in hot pursuit of
Pakistsani infiltrators.

01:04:53.064 --> 01:04:54.480
And most importantly,
they did not

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.021
threaten to open up
the second front.

01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:59.990
The place where India's
conventional advantage really

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:05.496
comes to bear is on the
international border, here.

01:05:05.496 --> 01:05:06.870
So most of the
fighting was here.

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.760
This was where the
infiltration was.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.350
But India has a huge advantage
in this plane sector, which

01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:12.516
is the international border.

01:05:12.516 --> 01:05:14.842
So any time there has been
a previous provocation,

01:05:14.842 --> 01:05:17.050
India has always mobilized
forces here and threatened

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.925
to open up a second
front where it can really

01:05:18.925 --> 01:05:21.080
bring its conventional
power to bear on Pakistan.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.570
This time, the BJP
refused to threaten

01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:26.150
to open-- it did
not mobilize any

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:27.820
of its mainstay
conventional forces

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.915
on the international
border and didn't threaten

01:05:29.915 --> 01:05:31.120
to open up a second front.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.620
And so it took Indian
forces a lot longer,

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.630
and they sustained much heavier
losses in the Kargil War,

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:41.460
because they had to expel
Pakistani forces symmetrically.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.840
So they didn't have the
virtue of air power hitting

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.510
behind Pakistani lines.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:52.250
And there wasn't any ability to
take pressure off of this front

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:56.200
by opening up a second front
in the international border.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.740
So already you can see
India's response is restrained

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.190
because Pakistan
was a nuclear power.

01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:06.380
So shortly after September
11 here, two months later--

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.740
three months later,
there was an attack

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.920
on the Indian parliament.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.294
So you had about half
a dozen gunman break

01:06:14.294 --> 01:06:16.460
through the barriers of the
Indian Parliament house.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.670
I mean imagine an
attack on Congress here.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:19.800
It would be the equivalent.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:26.510
So you had Jaish-e-Mohammed and
Lushkar-e-Taiba joint attack

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.530
on the Indian
parliament in Delhi.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:31.780
Never heard of before that
they-- these militant groups,

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.280
which are nominally supported
by the Pakistani state,

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.150
would attack the Indian capital.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.380
So you had this
attack in December.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.381
The BJP is furious.

01:06:42.381 --> 01:06:43.880
Imagine what the
United States would

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:48.680
do if a militant organization
attacked the US Congress.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.670
So you can imagine the
outrage in India at the time.

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:55.000
So the BJP contemplates
limited war here

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.320
across the line of control,
so destroying terrorist camps

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.720
across the line of control.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.675
Under a lot of pressure
from the US government

01:07:03.675 --> 01:07:05.050
because remember
what's happened?

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:07.492
We were mobilizing for war
on Afghanistan at this point.

01:07:07.492 --> 01:07:08.200
We need Pakistan.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.210
The United States
needs General Musharraf

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:14.080
to not be distracted by a
conventional war with India.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.690
Can you imagine how that
would have affected the US

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.571
war in Afghanistan if
India and Pakistan got

01:07:18.571 --> 01:07:20.070
into a conventional
war at the time.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:23.000
So a lot of pressure on
both sides to not go to war.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.051
So Deputy Secretary of State
at the time, Dick Armitage,

01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:26.800
gets on the phone.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.710
He's on the phone, he said,
twice a day with the BJP

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:33.690
urging them to show restraint.

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.250
And India backs off
actually for a while.

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.940
But then there's
a secondary attack

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.390
in a small town called
Kaluchack in Jammu,

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:43.440
which is an army town.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.670
And the Jaish militants killed
36 Indian army families.

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:49.480
And so the BJP, at
this point-- this

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.049
is the second peak
of the crisis.

01:07:52.049 --> 01:07:53.590
And so the BJP says
enough is enough.

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:57.730
So they mobilize India's three--
they call them the three Strike

01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:58.640
Corps.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.560
These are the main offensive
components of the Indian army.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.940
800,000 forces in total.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.430
And they're mobilized in
their assembly boxes, which

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:10.490
are much larger than shown
here, 60 kilometer breadth,

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:13.960
in these three positions,
poised for attacks

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.863
across the international border.

01:08:15.863 --> 01:08:17.279
So this is where
the threat of war

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:19.660
becomes real for South Asia.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.520
SO the BJP, you don't mobilize
these forces just as a bluff.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.870
And so there's a real
concern that the BJP

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:29.040
would authorize attacks.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.829
And at this point,
Pakistan engages

01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:32.120
in some serious nuclear signal.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.520
They test three nuclear
capable missiles,

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.910
without the warheads of course.

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:40.240
President Musharraf makes
very explicit nuclear threats

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.656
to the Indians that if they
cross the international border

01:08:42.656 --> 01:08:45.810
that Pakistan may have no option
but to use nuclear weapons.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:48.500
The US and the United
Kingdom evacuate

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.640
their nonessential
personnel from India.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.348
I mean it was very
serious at this point.

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:01.330
After these nuclear
threats, and again,

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:05.140
a lot of pressure from the
United States on India,

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.529
Prime Minister Vajpayee
orders, several months later,

01:09:08.529 --> 01:09:11.210
the Strike Corps back to their
peacetime cantonments, which

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:12.970
are in the interior of India.

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:15.910
And later on, he
said, look, I don't

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:17.660
think that a risk of
nuclear war was high,

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.200
but I didn't want to be
responsible for starting one.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.881
And so there was a
real palpable threat

01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:24.380
that if India engaged in this
kind of conventional operation

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.840
against Pakistan and
defeated the Pakistan army,

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.340
that there's a real risk that
nuclear weapons would be used.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.650
The third instance was
the Bombay attack in 2008

01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:40.270
that we already talked
about at the beginning.

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:45.040
So here, this was even more
audacious, in some ways,

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.439
than the parliament attack.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:49.880
This wasn't a ragtag group
of six guys in a car.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.689
This was a dozen well-trained,
heavily armed militants coming

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:56.140
by sea from Karachi,
quarterbacked-- it now turns

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:02.480
out-- by retired ISI handlers.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.830
The United States picked
up signals intelligence

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:10.320
and intercepts between
handlers in Pakistan

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.560
who were former ISI officers
quarterbacking the operation

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.090
as they attacked Bombay.

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.680
And it killed 170 civilians.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.580
So the media tends to downplay
the number of Westerners that

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.600
were deliberately
targeted by the militant--

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.640
by the LeT militants.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.530
And India was justifiably
outraged at this attack.

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:42.022
But the government
was again paralyzed.

01:10:42.022 --> 01:10:43.730
So this time it's the
Congress government

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:46.210
not the BJP government
that's making decisions.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:48.270
And it doesn't mobilize
forces this time.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:49.900
The prime minister,
Mahmud Hussein,

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.660
said he did not want a
repeat of 2001, 2002.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.080
We don't want to mobilize
forces and not do anything.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.560
So what do we do?

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.230
And here we have the paralysis
that the Indian policy

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:05.609
community faces is any serious
conventional retaliation risks

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:06.400
nuclear escalation.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.320
I think this is where
India finds itself.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.520
And this is from
a cabinet meeting.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.460
So this is a report
from the cabinet meeting

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.950
where the prime
minister and the defense

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:21.090
minister, foreign minister,
finance minister, home minister

01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:22.710
are meeting.

01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.810
And the conclusion was,
when the dust settled,

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.660
all the principles agreed
that the unpredictability

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.610
on the Pakistan side and the
fear that its decision-makers

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:30.900
could offer a disproportionate
response, including

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.260
the nuclear option,
stymied any possible chance

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.630
of military action on India'a
behalf after-- 26/11 is their--

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:39.310
is what they call
the Bombay attacks.

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:43.270
It happened on the
26th of November.

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:47.180
So there's real
paralysis now about how

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.150
do you deter-- see
nuclear weapons can't

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:52.929
deter militant attacks
against the Indian state.

01:11:52.929 --> 01:11:54.470
But you lost your
conventional option

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:56.261
to punish Pakistan,
which was how you tried

01:11:56.261 --> 01:11:58.370
to deter it in the first place.

01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:01.460
And Pakistan has
successfully deterred

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.700
Indian a conventional power by
lowering the nuclear threshold,

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.100
taking a play right out
of the NATO playbook,

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.335
threatening early nuclear use if
Indian forces threaten to cross

01:12:11.335 --> 01:12:14.170
the international border.

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:16.260
So now, after
nuclearization 1998,

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.320
what we have is more
frequent and intense

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.024
crises triggered by Pakistan.

01:12:21.024 --> 01:12:22.690
There's a belief that
they're emboldened

01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:25.740
by the shield of
early nuclear use,

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:30.087
knowing that India can't really
retaliate with ground power.

01:12:30.087 --> 01:12:32.170
We can get into-- we have
some time for questions.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:35.130
We can get into why India hasn't
tried to develop an air strike

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:36.074
option.

01:12:36.074 --> 01:12:38.240
That gets into the politics
of the Indian military--

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.020
the service rivalries
that India has.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:47.360
The Air Force has always
refused to think about options

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.710
that don't involve
the army mobilizing

01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:52.630
because the belief is that
Pakistan would retaliate

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:53.610
on the ground.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:57.030
And so the Air Force doesn't
believe that standalone air

01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:00.590
options are possible without a
ground option being mobilized.

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:02.115
AUDIENCE: So what
is Pakistan trying

01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:03.366
to achieve with these attacks?

01:13:03.366 --> 01:13:05.823
VIPIN NARANG: So this is an
interesting strategic question.

01:13:05.823 --> 01:13:07.830
What does Pakistan hope--
so if your Pakistan,

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.371
you're facing a
conventional-- you're

01:13:09.371 --> 01:13:11.720
facing massive conventional
inferiority, which is only

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.180
growing because the size
and growth rates of the two

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.460
countries are so
disproportionate that India's

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.420
gap is just going-- it's
going to be a yawning

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.130
gap at this point.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:23.130
So going forward, how
do you slow India down?

01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:25.580
So there's one theory
out there, which

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:30.400
is these periodic attacks on
India's financial and political

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.690
hubs create these
periodic crises to get

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:36.900
foreign investors skittish.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.210
So you get periodic slowdowns
being triggered by this,

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:41.730
and you can slow down
India's economic growth

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.609
potential if you make it
risky to invest in India.

01:13:44.609 --> 01:13:45.900
So that's one theory out there.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:50.030
The other theory is Pakistan
has always had crazies

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.870
that is trained to attack.

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.680
Good crazies kill Indians.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.430
Bad crazies kill Pakistanis.

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:58.017
And so they need-- there's
a safety valve theory.

01:13:58.017 --> 01:13:59.600
And they've always
had a safety valve.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.020
Before it was Kashmir.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.310
Now, Kashmir is locked
down because Indian army

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:06.387
knows how to prevent
infiltration at Kashmir.

01:14:06.387 --> 01:14:07.720
For a while, it was Afghanistan.

01:14:10.827 --> 01:14:13.160
US military has to be asked,
why are these guys speaking

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.320
Punjabi in Afghanistan?

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.410
Because these are the Punjabi
trained militants, the LeT,

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:20.420
that have gone now to
Afghanistan to fight,

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:21.860
and they're killing Americans.

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:24.690
And now if you can turn them
against the Indian state,

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.611
great.

01:14:26.611 --> 01:14:28.360
As long as they're not
killing Pakistanis,

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.360
they are good militants.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.600
And so there's one
theory out there

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.400
that the Pakistan state still
views these militant groups

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.100
as strategic assets
of the states

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:44.160
to perpetually attack and
bleed India by 1,000 cuts.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.920
And if you can't get
in through Kashmir,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.740
if you could infiltrate
by sea to Bombay, great.

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.170
If you can hit Delhi, great.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.460
Before nuclear weapons,
hitting Bombay or Delhi

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.389
really risked serious
conventional retaliation.

01:14:59.389 --> 01:15:00.930
But now that you
have nuclear weapons

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:03.000
and operational
nuclear capability

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.960
and tactical nuclear
weapons to deter

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.650
that conventional
retaliation, those kinds

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:09.820
of audacious attacks
are more possible.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.070
And so these are the two
kind of theories out there,

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:13.560
and they're not
mutually exclusive.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:18.286
AUDIENCE: What [INAUDIBLE]
in Afghanistan.

01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:20.161
What are they called
the thieves, the rebels,

01:15:20.161 --> 01:15:24.369
or whatever-- they were fighting
[INAUDIBLE] in Afghanistan?

01:15:24.369 --> 01:15:26.660
VIPIN NARANG: I mean I think
that there are people here

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.749
who can say more
about this who had

01:15:28.749 --> 01:15:30.040
firsthand experience with this.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.410
But there are a lot of reports
that you had Punjabi speaking.

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:40.670
I mean most of the Afghan
mujahideen are Pashto speaking.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.050
There's a Haqqani network.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:46.140
A lot of these
networks predate 9/11.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:50.160
And they were supported,
funded, and there

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.120
are strong relationships
between the ISI

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.227
and some of the mujahideen
groups in Afghanistan that

01:15:56.227 --> 01:15:58.310
ended up being the Taliban--
remember the only two

01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:59.935
states that recognized
the Taliban were

01:15:59.935 --> 01:16:01.500
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.900
So the networks that
Pakistan had in Afghanistan

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.880
were very strong.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.870
And they had these
other groups also,

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:11.800
so if they needed militants
to go help fight what ended up

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.750
being the Americans as
well as Karzai's ANA,

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:19.100
it would be the LeT and
the Jaish-e-Mohammeds.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.490
So there were reports of
Punjabi speaking militants,

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:24.480
well-trained Punjabi
speaking militants,

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.420
fighting in Afghanistan
alongside Pashto

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.290
speaking Haqqani
network militants.

01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:32.180
So that was a safety
valve for a while.

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.230
And now, I think
this is why Pakistan

01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:36.727
may have an
incentive for a fight

01:16:36.727 --> 01:16:38.310
to continue in
Afghanistan for a while

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.477
so it has someplace
to send its crazies.

01:16:40.477 --> 01:16:41.810
It's a safety valve for a while.

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.185
And they're worried about
Indian influence in Afghanistan

01:16:44.185 --> 01:16:47.600
so that there would
be-- those militants

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.870
would be boxed into Pakistan.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.250
On the one hand,
Pakistan faces--

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:55.730
there was this awful
school attack recently.

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:58.775
There's a real terrorist
problem in Pakistan also.

01:16:58.775 --> 01:17:00.150
So bad militants
kill Pakistanis.

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:01.405
Good militants kill
Indians and Americans.

01:17:01.405 --> 01:17:01.905
Steph?

01:17:01.905 --> 01:17:04.100
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask that question as

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.980
to whether [INAUDIBLE]
are all bad.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:09.380
But initially, that
comes out maybe

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.670
to supporting the
militants out there.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:16.576
Do you think that that is--
that initial rhetoric is

01:17:16.576 --> 01:17:17.310
going to stick?

01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:19.337
Or do you think they
will then go back

01:17:19.337 --> 01:17:20.803
to what they've
always done which

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.002
is we're going to support
whoever destablizes people

01:17:23.002 --> 01:17:23.350
we don't like?

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:25.766
VIPIN NARANG: So I think the
evidence suggests the latter.

01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:32.200
I mean it is remarkable that
the LeT-- so after 2001, 2000,

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.180
the LeT was nominally banned.

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.490
But they just renamed
themselves to Jamaat-ud-Dawa.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:41.780
And Hafiz Saeed who is
the head of the LeT lives

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.930
openly, not out in
the tribal areas.

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:46.070
He lives outside Lahore
in a town called Muridke.

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:47.484
Everybody knows where they are.

01:17:47.484 --> 01:17:48.650
They're openly fund-raising.

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:54.330
He goes on TV calling for
the death of Indians openly.

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:58.720
And the fact that he--
it's an open question

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.880
whether it's active
support or passive support.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.930
But at least the evidence
suggest-- the evidence suggests

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.425
at least passive support.

01:18:06.425 --> 01:18:08.920
He is allowed to freely operate.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.240
He is allowed to
freely raise funds.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240
The organization exists.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.340
It could be shut
down very easily.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.790
It's in the heart of Pakistan.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.450
It's like 30 kilometers
from the Indian border.

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:19.060
The Indians could hit it.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.610
But they have refrained
from doing so.

01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:24.724
But the network is allowed to
recruit and operate openly.

01:18:24.724 --> 01:18:27.390
And we're not talking about like
the Northwest Front, the Khyber

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:30.180
Pakhtunkhwa, the tribal areas.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.220
This is the heartland
of Pakistan.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:41.210
And so it offends credibility
to think that it's not--

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:45.670
there isn't some state policy to
allow certain groups to operate

01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:49.179
to some extent while thinking
you could target the rest.

01:18:49.179 --> 01:18:51.720
But there's also that suggests
these guys were different hats

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.210
on different days.

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:57.580
But the sectarian groups, I
think, are allowed to operate.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.980
Those are the ones that--
the other good militants seem

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.105
to be those that kill Shia.

01:19:01.105 --> 01:19:03.170
As long as they don't
kill Sunni, it's fine.

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:05.960
So some of those groups
have been very, very fierce

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.590
and are allowed
to operate still.

01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:11.890
In the Haqqani
network and the LeT,

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:14.780
as long as they're not
killing Sunnis in Punjab,

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.540
it seems like the
Pakistani state

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:19.929
is willing to tolerate
their existence.

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:21.470
And so that's an
active state policy.

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:22.920
And this is different
from the Cold War.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.670
We didn't have-- I don't
think the United States

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:27.390
and the Soviet Union had to deal
with that kind of proxy level

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:29.412
militancy where you have
two strategic assets.

01:19:29.412 --> 01:19:30.870
You have the militant
organizations

01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:33.119
to try and weaken the other
state plus nuclear weapons

01:19:33.119 --> 01:19:34.989
to deter the retaliation.

01:19:34.989 --> 01:19:36.530
So that combination
is, I think, what

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:41.090
makes it particularly dangerous,
which is what I conclude here.

01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:44.970
So you have-- India is
extremely frustrated.

01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:46.770
And I think the worry
in the United States

01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:49.070
is that if there's another
mass casualty terrorist

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:53.180
attack in India, how
will the BJP-- now

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.740
you have a new prime minister
who is, by all accounts,

01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.890
a little more aggressive than
his predecessors, a little more

01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:01.200
hawkish.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.100
And right now, the
stability in South Asia

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.230
is predicated on Indian
restraint following

01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:10.530
one of these mass casualty
terrorist attacks.

01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:14.625
So if there's another Bombay,
how will the BJP respond?

01:20:16.609 --> 01:20:18.650
We can talk-- if anybody
has heard of Cold Start,

01:20:18.650 --> 01:20:19.330
we talk about that.

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:21.246
You guys can all email
me if anyone ever wants

01:20:21.246 --> 01:20:22.510
to get into some of the weeds.

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:27.840
But the basic idea is India
has conventional superiority.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.510
It has not used it yet.

01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:33.370
There's some belief that
Pakistan's nuclear threat is

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:35.760
a bluff and that
India could execute

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:38.990
certain conventional objectives
below the nuclear threshold.

01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.830
Maybe, maybe not.

01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:40.800
It's pretty risky.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.030
Particularly, we talk about
tactical nuclear weapons

01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:44.488
that would, at
least at some point,

01:20:44.488 --> 01:20:48.540
be devolved to the
brigadier level maybe.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.920
And so you'll have-- it's not
just one nuclear threshold,

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.590
but nine.

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:56.187
And so you have
to worry about one

01:20:56.187 --> 01:20:57.770
of them deciding
that this is the end,

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.370
and they use nuclear weapons.

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:03.430
I think the Pakistani strategy
is actually quite rational.

01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:06.089
It's deterring with
the rational threatened

01:21:06.089 --> 01:21:07.880
that we might use
tactical nuclear weapons,

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.535
but also through a
madman mechanism.

01:21:09.535 --> 01:21:11.160
We're going to develop
nuclear weapons,

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.576
and hey, one of our brigadiers
might use them if you come.

01:21:13.576 --> 01:21:17.770
And that reinforces the rational
deterrent threat as well.

01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:22.860
And so, so far, both
in Kargil-- sorry.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.460
In three instances, Kargil,
Parakram, and Bombay,

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.470
India has relatively restrained
its conventional retaliation

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:31.800
and its response.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.300
And so far, that has
taken India and Pakistan

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.504
off the escalatory highway.

01:21:38.504 --> 01:21:40.920
But it's no guarantee that
that'll continue going forward.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.400
I think the emotions in India
are running very high vis-a-vis

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.420
Pakistan.

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.260
Particularly, there's
increased shelling

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:51.330
across the line of control
in the past several months.

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:54.940
And if there's a significant
attack in a major city that

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.660
involves the death of
many Indian civilians,

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.830
there'll be a lot of pressure
on Prime Minister Modi

01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:02.690
to do something about it.

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:05.030
And then all bets are
off because you'll

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:06.640
have nuclear weapons
potentially mixed

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.849
with conventional
conflict, and that

01:22:08.849 --> 01:22:10.140
would be the escalation ladder.

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.598
I think that's
something that we're

01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:14.415
likely-- it's this element of
terrorist attack mass casualty

01:22:14.415 --> 01:22:16.790
terrorist attacks that didn't
exist in the Cold War, that

01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:19.510
makes South Asia quite
different, I think,

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:22.520
from the US and Soviet balance.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.480
And so it's that
combination of proxy forces

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.870
and the arms race that, I think,
makes it particularly unstable.

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:30.010
So I'm going to stop there.

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:31.300
We are almost out
of time, but I'm

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.570
happy to take
questions for a while

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.100
if anybody has any further
thoughts or anything.

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:34.420
Yeah?

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.586
AUDIENCE: Does Pakistan
have strategic weapons aimed

01:22:36.586 --> 01:22:37.494
at Indian cities or--

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:38.410
VIPIN NARANG: It does.

01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:39.050
Yeah.

01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:41.039
AUDIENCE: --weapon
also reach [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:41.830
VIPIN NARANG: Yeah.

01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:46.650
So this gets into a concept
known as escalation dominance.

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:50.360
Pakistan also has
strategic weapons

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.120
that put most of India's
matrices in reach.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:57.330
The idea being that that
deters Indian retaliation

01:22:57.330 --> 01:22:59.065
for tactical
nuclear-- so Pakistan

01:22:59.065 --> 01:23:01.420
views tactical nuclear
use as a war terminating

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.430
strategy because of
the strategic weapons.

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:05.180
So the idea is if any
conventional forces

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.740
attack, Pakistan stands
and fights conventionally.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:08.240
Fine.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:08.690
They start losing.

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:10.980
They use tactical nuclear
weapons on Indian forces.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.980
But now I have a secure
second strike capability

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.210
also if I'm Pakistan.

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:17.750
So India has no incentive to use
its strategic nuclear weapons

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:23.770
against Pakistani cities because
nuclear use on your forces

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:26.680
operating on Pakistani soil,
that's already happened.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.630
Am I willing to risk Delhi
and Bombay for retaliating.

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:30.624
Probably not.

01:23:30.624 --> 01:23:32.790
Now absent the strategic
capabilities, you're right.

01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:34.950
Then, India could
easily retaliate,

01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:38.062
and there would be no
reciprocation from Pakistan.

01:23:38.062 --> 01:23:39.520
But Pakistan is
trying to establish

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.237
what it calls escalation
dominance so that it could

01:23:42.237 --> 01:23:43.820
use tactical nuclear
weapons, and that

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:44.778
would be the end of it.

01:23:44.778 --> 01:23:46.760
So India would have no
incentive to retaliate

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.950
with strategic nuclear
weapons against Pakistan.

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:50.658
There is some belief
that India's looking

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:53.350
at lower order use options.

01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:55.371
India has no tactical
nuclear weapons itself.

01:23:55.371 --> 01:23:56.870
But there are some
capabilities that

01:23:56.870 --> 01:24:01.370
could be used for softer
targets than just cities.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.510
And it may be that
India tries to develop

01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:05.900
tit-for-tat capabilities.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:11.580
And then that's basically your
escalation ladder as well.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:12.290
In the back?

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:14.250
AUDIENCE: So if
India is so paralyzed

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:18.170
and Pakistan realizes
this, why hasn't Pakistan

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:20.587
increase the
frequency of attack?

01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:23.170
VIPIN NARANG: I think part of
it is you can't do it too often.

01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:25.500
You do it too often, and
then the core world opinion--

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:29.110
I think there's a limit to
how often you can do it.

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:32.460
But once every two, three
years is not nothing.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.830
And there's always chatter.

01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:37.687
There have been several
instances where the Indian home

01:24:37.687 --> 01:24:40.270
ministry claims-- now, I don't
know how good the evidence is--

01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:46.400
that they've disrupted several
attacks by LeT on Indians--

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.720
on India.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.350
But every several years, I
think that's not nothing.

01:24:54.350 --> 01:25:01.900
And they also choose relatively
strategic moments to do it.

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:08.130
So if you look at the timing of
the attack on the parliament,

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:11.410
two months after 9/11, just as
the Pakistani US relationship

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:12.665
is growing again.

01:25:12.665 --> 01:25:14.290
Maybe there's a belief
you can get away

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:18.300
with it because the US
is going to protect you.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:25.460
The Bombay attack was just
as then President Musharraf

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:28.740
was-- there was discussion
of concluding a back channel

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:31.380
final agreement over Kashmir.

01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:35.290
And the LeT and the
India-focused militants

01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:38.160
acted as veto
players, as spoilers.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.930
And so there was
a comp-- something

01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:43.260
known as the composite
dialogue ongoing between India

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:47.470
and Pakistan in 2008 where
literally everybody knew

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:50.700
what the final solution peace
deal between India and Pakistan

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.200
would like.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.010
And President Musharraf
was very serious about it.

01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:56.754
This was spoilers within
Pakistan vetoing that deal

01:25:56.754 --> 01:25:57.920
and disrupting the dialogue.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.880
So India had no option
but to terminate

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.230
the composite
dialogue after Bombay.

01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:03.860
And it hasn't really restarted.

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:06.800
And so those strategic
moments, I think,

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:13.380
are chosen by Pakistani
militants to attack India.

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:13.880
Yes, sir?

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.544
So what's the story-- I've heard
bits and pieces about Khan.

01:26:17.544 --> 01:26:18.414
How did he evolve?

01:26:18.414 --> 01:26:19.372
Where did he come from?

01:26:19.372 --> 01:26:21.140
What was--

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:29.176
VIPIN NARANG: Yes, so that's
a whole other-- AQ Khan,

01:26:29.176 --> 01:26:30.050
he stole the designs.

01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:32.240
He provided the uranium
enrichment capability

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.180
to Pakistan.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.180
He orchestrated a network
of global suppliers

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:40.940
for the components
for the centrifuges,

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.710
which he then leveraged
for both state policy.

01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:47.100
So he used that network
to get North Korea

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.640
its centrifuge capability.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.190
But whether, with complicit
state support or acting

01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:57.650
on his own, he also
decided to make

01:26:57.650 --> 01:27:01.070
some money by moonlighting,
maybe, with Iran and Libya.

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:03.262
And there's believed to
be a fourth customer.

01:27:03.262 --> 01:27:04.220
Don't know who that is.

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.650
But there's a big debate also in
the Pakistan nuclear community

01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:09.930
about how influential
AQ Khan really was.

01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:13.280
I mean they're moving to the
plutonium designs anyway.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.450
PAEC, which is the Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission.

01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:22.500
They're responsible for
plutonium production pathway.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:27.210
They're competing for
designs and for ownership

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:28.320
of the Pakistani program.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.936
So in Pakistan, he
still-- he claims

01:27:31.936 --> 01:27:33.560
to be the father of
the Pakistani bomb.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.476
That's up for dispute.

01:27:34.476 --> 01:27:39.767
But some of the
proliferation activities, it

01:27:39.767 --> 01:27:41.600
is unclear whether they
were state sponsored

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.800
or whether there was
some state complicity,

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.258
and he just acted on his own
or whether he acted completely

01:27:46.258 --> 01:27:46.974
on his own.

01:27:46.974 --> 01:27:49.522
AUDIENCE: But he served this
thing, I mean is it true?

01:27:49.522 --> 01:27:52.366
I mean did he have this
business that basically

01:27:52.366 --> 01:27:56.039
sells nuclear technology to
anyone who will pay the money?

01:27:56.039 --> 01:27:57.580
VIPIN NARANG: I
mean, like I said-- I

01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:02.230
mean he-- there was a catalog.

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:05.280
You could get a
brochure for-- yeah.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.370
And so it is true
that there was--

01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:14.060
he definitely had really
significant dealings

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.230
with Iran, which is interesting
because Iran and Pakistan

01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:19.870
aren't natural allies--
are the ones who made Shia,

01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:26.060
Sunni-- they're not natural.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.845
Iran has also been involved
with the Balochistan insurgency

01:28:29.845 --> 01:28:30.800
in Pakistan.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.590
So that he would sell
centrifuges to Iran

01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:34.590
seems a little puzzling.

01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:36.673
May be it was for-- seems
like personal gain would

01:28:36.673 --> 01:28:38.590
be a very strong explanation.

01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:44.050
There's some evidence
that he approached Iraq

01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:49.150
in the late 1980s to see if
they're interested in uranium

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:49.740
enrichment.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.600
Saddam Hussein thought it was
a trap, so he passed on it.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.660
But, yeah, I mean
there's no question

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.276
that there was-- this is a
big nonproliferation failure.

01:28:58.276 --> 01:28:59.776
AUDIENCE: I can't
remember if I read

01:28:59.776 --> 01:29:05.958
about it on [INAUDIBLE]
media or [INAUDIBLE],

01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:07.422
but I remember
reading about this.

01:29:07.422 --> 01:29:11.330
And what they said was that he
was doing it for personal gain.

01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:12.530
VIPIN NARANG: Yeah, there's no
question he made a lot of money

01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.650
from it.

01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:14.400
But you would have to
leverage some assets

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.676
from Pakistan military
to do some of this stuff.

01:29:16.676 --> 01:29:18.550
There's no way that they
didn't-- some people

01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:20.980
didn't know about unless
they were in on the take,

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.669
which is entirely possible.

01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:24.460
I mean I find it hard--
certainly the North

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.200
Korean deal, I mean they
flew Pakistani C-17,

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.704
so it was military transport
that took the first centrifuge

01:29:31.704 --> 01:29:32.870
cascade over to North Korea.

01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:34.370
So that was definitely
state to state.

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:35.953
Some of the other
stuff is just really

01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:37.810
murky as to the level
of state complicity.

01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:38.900
Were there people in
the Pakistan government

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:39.910
who knew he was doing it.

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:41.630
I'd probably-- it would be hard
for me to believe that they

01:29:41.630 --> 01:29:42.520
didn't.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.990
But it may not have
been state policy.

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.850
Yes, sir?

01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:48.706
Last question, I
think, then we got to--

01:29:48.706 --> 01:29:52.650
So I think that the
influence of the US support

01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:54.129
is, perhaps, understated.

01:29:54.129 --> 01:29:59.552
If we ignored Pakistan,
didn't like them anymore,

01:29:59.552 --> 01:30:03.496
and the entire international
community turned on them,

01:30:03.496 --> 01:30:05.961
it might be devastating
for them, especially

01:30:05.961 --> 01:30:08.679
economic sanctions [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:08.679 --> 01:30:10.720
VIPIN NARANG: So we imposed
sanctions after 1998.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.000
But then after September
11, we needed Pakistan.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.920
AUDIENCE: How long
will we need them?

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.745
[INAUDIBLE]

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.870
VIPIN NARANG: There are a
couple good books on this

01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:20.490
out recently.

01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:21.590
I'm not a Pakistan expert.

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:25.220
And this gets into very
like-- the empirical evidence

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:29.017
for this is-- we don't know.

01:30:29.017 --> 01:30:30.600
But Pakistan could
be very vulnerable.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.740
I mean I think a nontrivial
proportion of their revenue

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.370
comes from US and
international aid.

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:43.480
But on the other hand,
given the militancy problem,

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.910
I think most countries
prefer a stable Pakistan

01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:48.000
to an unstable Pakistan.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.210
And heavy sanctions
could really disrupt

01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:52.320
the fabric of that state.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:56.434
And say so it's a very
thin line you walk.

01:30:56.434 --> 01:30:58.850
And part of it is, I think the
opportunity that the United

01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:00.720
States had was in the 1980s.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.995
And there was a belief in
the Reagan administration

01:31:01.995 --> 01:31:03.203
that it was one or the other.

01:31:03.203 --> 01:31:06.740
It was either we needed to
Pakistan against the Sovs

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.930
or it's the nuclear program.

01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:10.640
But we couldn't deal with
both at the same time.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.432
The United states wasn't happy.

01:31:12.432 --> 01:31:14.890
It wasn't like the US was happy
about the Pakistani nuclear

01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:16.790
program.

01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:19.220
But it is certainly
true that the executive

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.687
was willing to
look the other way

01:31:20.687 --> 01:31:22.520
and tolerate certain
movement up to a point,

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.930
probably on the belief
that it was inevitable.

01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:25.510
There's nothing much
you can do about it.

01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:26.280
I'm not sure if that's true.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.560
I actually think that there were
a lot of leverage points we--

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.454
the United States could
have had in the 1980s

01:31:30.454 --> 01:31:31.870
and didn't take
advantage of them.

01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:34.530
But that's also--
an administration

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:36.780
fighting this war may not
believe it has the bandwidth

01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.080
to deal with both.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.712
And I think that's
where they ended up.

01:31:39.712 --> 01:31:42.170
But if there was ever a point,
it was probably in the 1980s

01:31:42.170 --> 01:31:44.849
to stop Pakistan from
becoming a nuclear state

01:31:44.849 --> 01:31:45.640
in the first place.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640
But now that they
are, it's really hard

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.272
to see what we can do.

01:31:49.272 --> 01:31:51.150
Aaron, yeah?

01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:56.100
AUDIENCE: There is an overall
question here, which is tough.

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:59.070
I mean it's a very
unstable situation

01:31:59.070 --> 01:32:02.040
between India and Pakistan.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.505
And you either keep
going from them

01:32:05.505 --> 01:32:09.960
leading the way it has been
going, or you take a big step.

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:13.425
And the big step
is either you're

01:32:13.425 --> 01:32:17.649
going to do something
war-like or peace-like.

01:32:17.649 --> 01:32:20.094
And there is a
peace-like thing which

01:32:20.094 --> 01:32:24.495
never seems to surface,
which is, look,

01:32:24.495 --> 01:32:29.063
if you can't solve
this by war-like steps,

01:32:29.063 --> 01:32:31.839
then you have to solve
it by eliminating

01:32:31.839 --> 01:32:34.284
the political tension.

01:32:34.284 --> 01:32:38.685
And that doesn't seem
to be possible in India.

01:32:38.685 --> 01:32:44.553
India is this world power,
and why don't they stand up--

01:32:44.553 --> 01:32:46.020
what's your analysis?

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.220
Why don't they stand
up and say, we're

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:51.245
not going to solve this
militarily so we better--

01:32:51.245 --> 01:32:53.620
VIPIN NARANG: I think there
was a real golden opportunity

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.460
in 2008.

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:57.360
I think Manmohan Singh and then
foreign secretary Shivshankar

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.510
Menon who's going to
be at MIT actually

01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:04.440
in February at the Center
for National Studies with us,

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.070
he can give more
insight on this.

01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:12.100
But I believe India was
ready to do that in 2008.

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:16.520
And Musharraf was ready
to do this in 2008.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:21.620
Certain elements of the
Pakistani security services

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.130
and their proxy forces
and the LeT were not.

01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:27.070
And so it was just
politically untenable,

01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:30.790
after the Bombay attack, for
the Indian political leadership.

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:32.984
And so the spoilers--
the spoilers spoiled.

01:33:32.984 --> 01:33:34.650
AUDIENCE: They spoiled
it, but the point

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:37.830
is that that was the
point to stand up,

01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:43.289
and probably again
because you're in a bind.

01:33:43.289 --> 01:33:45.080
VIPIN NARANG: But I
mean the politics of it

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.000
was just too-- I
mean there's just

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.455
no way that that
government could

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:51.640
have survived if it continued
with a composite dialogue.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:57.150
And it was also a case
where there were facing--

01:33:57.150 --> 01:33:59.550
elections were the next year.

01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:01.740
There was no way that the
composite dialogue could

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:02.560
have continued after bombing.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.601
No country could do that.

01:34:03.601 --> 01:34:04.900
No political leadership could.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.540
It's just unfortunate-- the
unfortunate nature of politics.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.960
And I think the LeT knew that.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.510
You perpetrate this
attack, and you

01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:13.968
will kill the composite dialogue
and the back channel talk.

01:34:13.968 --> 01:34:16.220
And that's exactly
what happened.

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:18.880
It may be-- it's interesting
because sometimes you

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.890
need a Nixon and
China moment, and Modi

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:24.315
who is hawkish in the BJP,
he has the credibility

01:34:24.315 --> 01:34:27.207
to get the right on his side.

01:34:27.207 --> 01:34:29.290
He's protect on his right
flank, which often tends

01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:31.110
to be the spoiler in India.

01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:32.667
So he has an
opportunity, I think.

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:35.250
And I wouldn't be surprised if
there's some movement toward it

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:38.160
in the administration provided
there are no other attacks.

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.795
So I think you're right.

01:34:39.795 --> 01:34:41.170
All the piecess--
everybody knows

01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:43.150
what the final deal looks like.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.240
There's one hiccup
about whether it's

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.950
sequential or simultaneous
demilitarization

01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:53.090
of the Siachen [INAUDIBLE]
or like minor things.

01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:54.190
I mean those are solvable.

01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:55.280
But everything else,
the line of control

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.210
becomes a de facto
national border.

01:34:57.210 --> 01:34:59.690
Everything else
gets adjudicated.

01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:03.681
And maybe-- Modi has five
years, so it's possible.

01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:05.222
If anyone in India
can do it, I think

01:35:05.222 --> 01:35:06.825
it has to be somebody
from the right.

01:35:06.825 --> 01:35:08.950
The question is whether
there's a willing partner--

01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:09.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:11.125
VIPIN NARANG: --willing
partners on Pakistan.

01:35:11.125 --> 01:35:12.890
Exactly.

01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:14.336
OK, I think we're over time.

01:35:14.336 --> 01:35:16.460
So we should-- I gotta pick
up my kid from daycare,

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:19.650
so thank you guys.

01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:21.200
Thanks!

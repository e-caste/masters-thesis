00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.190 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So
last time we finished

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:84%
by proving Bolzano's
intermediate value

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:84%
theorem, which states that a
continuous function achieves

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
all values in between
the function evaluated

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:90%
at the endpoint.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:55.625 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a continuous
function, neither--

00:00:55.625 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I take a value y between f of
a and f of b, so either f of a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is less than f of b
and y's in between

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than f of a and
less than f of b, or f of a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than f of b, but
y is still in between them.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists c in the
interval a, b so that f of c

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:90%
equals y.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So every value in between f
evaluated at the endpoints

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
is achieved.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I drew the picture
that went along

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:55.425 align:middle line:84%
with this a, b, f of a, f
of b, and that could be--

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and if we take
anything in between,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.322 align:middle line:84%
then there has to be some
c so that f of c equals y.

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
At least in the
picture, I've drawn

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
there's three different
guys, but there's always

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:90%
at least one.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
thing we talked

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
about at the end
of last lecture was

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that the image of a closed
and bounded interval

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
by a continuous function is,
again, a closed and bounded

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
interval, where e corresponds
to the absolute max of f,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and f corresponds so that--

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't call this f since
we already have f being used--

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:90%
let's make it d--

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the
absolute min of f.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's what we proved last
time is that if f is continuous,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
then there exists
e, d and r, such

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that the range of this
closed and bounded interval

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
is, again, a closed
and bounded interval.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So f is very well-behaved on
closed and bounded intervals.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.072 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see another way in
which continuous functions are

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
well behaved on a closed
and bounded interval in just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:90%
a second.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.184 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.184 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, a simple application of
the Bolzano intermediate value

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:90%
theorem is the following--

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
really is an application
of that theorem

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
that I labeled the
bisection method.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But let's chalk that up to
the Bolzano intermediate value

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
theorem, which is the
following that if f of x

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is any odd polynomial, then
f has at least one real root.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So any odd polynomial has
at least one real root.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So by the fundamental
theorem of algebra,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
every polynomial has exactly
n roots, n corresponding

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to the degree of the
polynomial, but these roots

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:90%
can be complex valued.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But for odd polynomials, there
must be at least one real root,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and this is a consequence of
the Bolzano intermediate value

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But instead of proving this
theorem in its full generality,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:84%
let me just give you a
representative example.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's take f of x
equals x to the 2021 minus

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:90%
x to the 2020 plus--

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
What's today?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.128 align:middle line:90%
I think the 25 or 24.

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:90%
--1025x minus 300.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.715 align:middle line:90%
So what's the point?

00:06:05.715 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:84%
As long as I plug
in a big enough x,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:90%
this will swamp everything here.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if I
stick in f of 100,000,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I leave it to you to check
that this is positive

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
because this will be 100,000
to the 2020 minus 100,000

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to the 2021, and
then plus this, which

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:90%
will be positive minus 300.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't matter.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So what really matters is this
guy with the largest power

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
will swamp all the other
ones and eventually

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
be positive if I stick in a
large enough positive value.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for this guy, if I
stick in a negative value,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:84%
then I get something
very big, but now

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
with a minus sign,
which will again

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:90%
swamp all these earlier guys.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't have
to choose minus 100,000.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.992 align:middle line:84%
If I just stick in 0,
I will get minus 300,

00:07:27.992 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:90%
which will be negative.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But you can check that if
I stick in minus 100,000,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:90%
this will still be negative.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Thus, by the intermediate
value theorem,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
there exists a c in
100,000 so that f of c

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 because 0 is something
in between f evaluated

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:90%
at these two endpoints.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is the same is that
as long as you go far enough

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
out and positive, then the
polynomial will be positive

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
if the coefficient out
in front is positive;

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and if you go far
enough out negative,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
then you'll get something
that's negative.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you apply the
intermediate value theorem

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:90%
to be able to find a root.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
one other thing we

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.525 align:middle line:84%
did with the statement of
the min-max theorem was,

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
can we drop any of the
assumptions on this theorem?

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
the example is no.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, if f from
a closed and bounded interval

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
is not continuous and, let's
say, f of 0 is less than 0,

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
f of a, f of b is
bigger than 0, then

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:42.495 align:middle line:84%
does there exist c, a, b,
such that f of c equals 0?

00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:45.862 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.862 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Let me put that question
mark at the end.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to come up with
an example of a function that

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is not continuous that
satisfies these conclusions,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and there does not exist a
point in between so that f of c

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Simplest being, I'll
just draw a picture.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's go from minus 1, 2.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So then the function is
f of x equals x minus 1.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is for x not equal
to 1, and let's make it a 1/2

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So this function
looks like 1/2 there.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.195 align:middle line:84%
So there is no value,
there is no c in between.

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
So x is between 0 and 2.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So you see f of 0 is equal
to minus 1, that's negative;

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
f of 2 is equal to
1, it's positive;

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
but there exists no c in
between, so that f of c

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
So what's the point I'm making?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We really do need
this hypothesis

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that the function is continuous
for this theorem to be true.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:84%
If you drop that
hypothesis, then the theorem

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:90%
is no longer true.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to move
on to a new concept called

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
uniform continuity.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And before I do this,
I'm going to rewrite

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:90%
the definition of continuity.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is an old
definition, but I

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
want to highlight a
specific aspect of it.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is me writing
the definition

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.495 align:middle line:90%
of a continuous function again.

00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So function f from a set
s to r is continuous.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So we said that means it's
continuous at every point,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
meaning if for all c And
s, it's continuous at c,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.215 align:middle line:84%
which means for all epsilon
positive, there exists a delta.

00:13:33.215 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this in examples
that we did proving continuity.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
This usually depends on
epsilon and c, the point where

00:13:51.980 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at, such
that for all x and s,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
x minus c less
than delta implies

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that f of x minus f of
c is less than epsilon.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again,
a bit of review.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to show
you that, in general,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:84%
when we verify that a function
is continuous on a set,

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
we have to show it's continuous
at every point in the set.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means for every
epsilon, there exist delta.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But this delta usually
depends on epsilon,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:84%
but it can also depend on
the point c, which is where

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:90%
we're checking continuity at.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So for simple
example, let's take

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
f of x equals 1 over x on
the open interval 0, 1.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So I claim f of x equals
1 over x is continuous.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So proof we have to show
that for every c and 0, 1

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
for all epsilon,
there exists that.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's see b and 0, 1,
but epsilon be positive.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, since this
kind of review,

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go through the
process of really the thinking

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.610 align:middle line:90%
behind choosing this delta.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's calculations
you do off to the side

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:90%
to try and get this delta.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But let's choose delta to
be the minimum of c over 2

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and c squared over
2 times epsilon.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
again emphasize

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
is this delta depends on c,
the point we're looking at,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and epsilon.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
So I claim this delta works.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:21.495 align:middle line:84%
Suppose x is in 0, 1, and x
minus c is less than delta.

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Then absolute value of x, this
is by the triangle inequality.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.898 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Let me write it this way.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
c absolute value is
equal to c minus x

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
plus x, which is less
than or equal to c

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
minus x plus x, which is less
than delta, which is less than

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
minimum of these two.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's certainly less than
or equal to c over 2 plus x.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And now c and x, these are in
0, 1, so they're all positive,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:90%
and therefore I get that--

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next board.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So if I subtract the c over
2 over to the other side,

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I get that c over
2 is less than x.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is as long as
x is in 0 and x minus c

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:90%
is less than delta.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:90%
This should not be a shock.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
There's 0, 1, c, c
over 2 3c over 2.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And so if x is in this
interval, it certainly

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
bounded away by c over 2.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Or if x is in here, then x is
certainly bigger than c over 2.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And now we look at
f of x minus f of c.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to
1 over x minus 1

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:84%
over c equals c minus x
over x times c, which is

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.315 align:middle line:90%
less than delta over x times c.

00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And now x is bigger than c over
2, so if I take 1 over that,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I get 1 over x is
less than 2 over c.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or equal
to 2 delta over c squared,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and delta is the
minimum of now c over 2

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and c squared over
2 times epsilon.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is less
than or equal to 2

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:26.843 align:middle line:84%
over c squared times c squared
over 2 epsilon equals epsilon.

00:19:26.843 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So I just went through
the proof of continuity

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
for 1 over x, which using better
machinery we could have proven.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But I did this to
highlight this point that's

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
showing continuity
of 1 over x on 0, 1,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that in showing that, this
delta that you are choosing

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
depends on the point
you're looking at.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So what the definition of
continuity says is for all c,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
for all epsilon,
you can find a delta

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:90%
depending on epsilon and c.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, uniform continuity
removes that necessity of delta

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
depending on c.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make a possibly
bad analogy in just a minute,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
but first let me write
down the definition

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:90%
of uniform continuity.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Let s be subset of r,
f going from s to r.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.810 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We say f is uniformly
continuous on s

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:84%
if for all epsilon positive,
there exists a delta depending

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
only on epsilon, such
that where all x, c and s,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:27.255 align:middle line:84%
with x minus c less than delta,
we get that f of x minus f of c

00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So a function being continuous
means that for all epsilon

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
you can find delta depending
on one of these points,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
depending on c so that if I
had this, then I have this.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Uniform continuity
says you can find delta

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.105 align:middle line:90%
that works across the board.

00:21:49.105 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to try and make
an analogy that hopefully I

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:84%
don't have to cut
out of this lecture.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's a bit like this.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a trip
down memory lane

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.395 align:middle line:90%
and imagine being at a party.

00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:15.936 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So you know everybody's
in the party

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and let's say that
everybody can hear,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:84%
their ears work
just about the same,

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and the goal is to
try and understand

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
each other's
conversation, try and hear

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:90%
each other's conversations.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order for me to hear
this person's conversation,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
loud they talk, I

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
have to be close enough
to be able to hear them.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And this changes from person
to person in the room.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can stand a foot away
from this person over here.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this person over
here is a low talker

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and I have to be
almost up in their face

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:90%
to be able to hear them.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that person
just whispers and I

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
have to be almost nose to
nose to be able to hear them.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a bit like a
function being continuous.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.044 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.044 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The threshold of hearing what
they're saying is the epsilon

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and I have to change my
delta depending on what point

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm at so that I can hear them.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, uniform continuity,
is kind of like everybody's

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
more or less speaking
around the same level,

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:90%
speaking at the same loudness.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So I just can be within,
say, one foot of everybody

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:90%
and be able to understand them.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Go to this person if I'm within
one foot I can hear them well.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
If I go to this person
and within one foot

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:90%
I can hear them well, and so on.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of at
least a loose analogy

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of the difference between
continuity and uniform

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:90%
continuity.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is a reasonably
interesting definition.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So we should see
examples and negate it.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
First off, you should be
able to convince yourself

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that a function that's
uniformly continuous

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:90%
is actually continuous.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to write
the proof of that down.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It follows essentially
straight from the definition.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at a function,
which is uniformly continuous.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So the function f of x equals
x squared on the interval 0,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:90%
1 is uniformly continuous.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:90%
So what's the proof?

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I want you to notice
I'm going to use kind

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of in a very essential
way that we're

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
on this closed and
bounded interval.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So we need to show
that for every epsilon,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.355 align:middle line:84%
there exists a delta so that
no matter what two points--

00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you like, here's a picture
that goes along with this--

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
so that if I look at
maybe two points that

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
are close to each
other less than delta,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
their function's value
is within epsilon.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And so let's say I'm
on an interval a, b.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But not just this point,
I could go over here

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to two other points that are
within delta of each other.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And if I look at the function
evaluated at the two points,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
then the difference
between these two guys

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.465 align:middle line:90%
is also less than epsilon.

00:26:16.465 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So I can move through
the party and as long

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:84%
as I'm close enough within a
uniform distance to somebody,

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I can hear them just fine.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So what a nice trip
down memory lane when we

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:90%
could be around other people.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's show this function
is uniformly continuous.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Choose delta to
be epsilon over 2.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see this delta
just depends on epsilon,

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
then if x and c are in 0, 1, and
x minus c is less than delta,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
then if I compute
the difference, x

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
squared minus c
squared, I can write

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:90%
as x plus c times x minus c.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And now I use the
triangle inequality,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or
equal to x minus c.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, these guys are in 0, 1,
so their absolute values always

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.650 align:middle line:90%
bounded by 1.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than
or equal to 1 plus 1,

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and then x minus c
is bounded by delta,

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:84%
which equals 2 times
delta, and delta

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
is chosen to be epsilon over 2.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:90%
So I get epsilon.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, how would
you choose delta?

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like I just chose
this delta out of nowhere.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:84%
In practice, how do
you choose delta?

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:90%
This is the computation you do.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You take x squared minus
c squared, split it,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:90%
you have this.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You can estimate with what
you know above by 2 here

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:90%
times delta.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So how do you choose delta
so that 2 times delta

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is, say, equal to epsilon?

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You choose delta to
be epsilon over 2.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's negate this
definition and then look at 1

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:84%
over x once again
and check to see

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:90%
if it's uniformly continuous.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:90%
We'll show it's not.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So the negation f from s to r
is not uniformly continuous.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So I saw a little bit of the
new Borat movie that came out.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So I almost wanted to say
f is uniformly continuous.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Not.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not uniformly continuous.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And now you negate the
rest of the definition.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:36.280 align:middle line:84%
If there exists some bad
epsilon, such that no matter

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
what delta you choose, there
exists some bad x and c

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and s, such that they're
close to each other,

00:29:51.370 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:84%
but the values are not
bigger than or equal to.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:90%
So let's revisit 1 over x.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
This is not uniformly continuous
on the open interval 0, 1.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So you see that this
function is continuous

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's not
uniformly continuous.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
We just proved that a minute
ago that it's continuous.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So let me now give you the
proof that this function is

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:90%
not uniformly continuous.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And what's the idea behind this?

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's one.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
This is not to scale,
but there's one

00:30:54.950 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:84%
as well, and 1 over x
shoots up to plus infinity

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.930 align:middle line:90%
as x approaches 0.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So what uniform
continuity says is

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.510 align:middle line:84%
that if I take any two
points in the interval that

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.730 align:middle line:84%
are close to each
other, then the outputs

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:90%
have to be close to each other.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Continuity, remember,
says if I fix a point,

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
then as long as I'm
close to that point,

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the outputs will be
close to each other.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Uniform says, no
matter what two points

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:84%
you choose, as long as
they're close together,

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
the outputs will be close
together in a controlled way.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I take two points
very close to each other here,

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
very close to 0, they can be
pretty close to each other.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their values
can be quite large.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Even though the difference
between the arguments

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:84%
are small, the values
can be quite large

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:90%
just because 1 over x shoots up.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:90%
So let's quantify this.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you what
the bad epsilon not is.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Choose epsilon not equals 2.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.575 align:middle line:84%
Now, any epsilon not
will work just fine.

00:32:27.575 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Let delta be positive.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to find x and
c and s within distance delta

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to each other whose values
vary by at least two.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's choose c to be the
minimum of delta and 1/2,

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to choose
x to be c over 2.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.820 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So just ignoring this half for
a minute, c is equal to delta,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
x is equal to delta
over 2, and then

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
1 over c minus 1 over x is
going to be 2 over delta.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And if delta is
very small, that's

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
certainly bigger
than or equal to 2.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But I had to throw in this 1/2
here because I chose epsilon

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:84%
not to be 2, and
delta's arbitrary.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So then we see that
x minus c, this

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
equals c over 2, which is
certainly less than or equal to

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:84%
since c is the minimum
of delta and 1 over 1/2

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is less than delta over 2,
which is less than delta.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we compute 1 over x
minus 1 over c, this is--

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
remember x is c over 2, so
this 1 over x is 2 over c, so 1

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.489 align:middle line:90%
over c.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:84%
And now from c being less
than or equal to 1 over 1/2m

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I get that 1 over c is going to
be bigger than or equal to 2.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of the proof.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So we see that even though
these two arguments are

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:84%
very close to each other, the
outputs are, in fact, separated

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.510 align:middle line:90%
by some fixed distance.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:90%
At least two.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But we could actually make it
bigger than 3, bigger than 4,

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.395 align:middle line:90%
whatever you like.

00:35:13.395 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
go over this example.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, I'll leave
it to you or maybe I'll

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:84%
put it on the
assignment, f of x equals

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:48.970 align:middle line:84%
x squared is not
uniformly continuous on r.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So we saw that it's uniformly
continuous on a closed interval

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:84%
0, 1, but it's not uniformly
continuous on all of r.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The reason being again
kind of because x squared

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.370 align:middle line:90%
is starting to get big.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So I can take two things
close to each other,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.570 align:middle line:84%
stick it into x squared,
and their outputs

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.540 align:middle line:84%
could be very different
from each other.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.795 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.795 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Didn't write out the
proof of this one,

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to go by a little
bit by the seat of our pants.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So we want to show this is
not uniformly continuous.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think epsilon 0 equals
1 is going to work just fine.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:50.373 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.373 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Let delta be
positive, and the idea

00:36:53.730 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is we want to choose
x to be some number.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it a plus--

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:15.570 align:middle line:84%
well, c will be some number,
and c equals some number,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:20.310 align:middle line:90%
x equals c plus delta over 2.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of scratch
work off to the side.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And let's see if we
can somehow choose c.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So first off, x minus
c will be delta over 2,

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:90%
which is less than delta.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And now let's see
if we can choose c

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:84%
so that x squared
minus c squared

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 1.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So c is kind of the thing
that we get to play with here.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is how
it actually goes

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
if you want to figure out the
proof before you write it down,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:90%
the scratch work to the side.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:90%
So choose c so that this--

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.908 align:middle line:84%
now, let's start
off with the thing

00:38:18.908 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to bound from below

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and start computing some stuff.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:90%
This is equal to x plus c--

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and c will be positive.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So this will be c, and
x will be positive.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So x plus c times
x minus c; now x

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:84%
plus c will be 2c plus
delta over 2; x minus c

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:90%
will be delta over 2.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.210 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So far all of these
things are equality,

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and we get this is
equal to 2c plus--

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.650 align:middle line:84%
so delta is 2c plus
delta squared over 2,

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and here we're going
to choose c positive.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to show it's
not uniformly continuous on r.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:27.618 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to find a
value of c and a value of x so

00:39:27.618 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
that they're within delta
distance to each other,

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.350 align:middle line:84%
but their outputs are
bigger than or equal to 1.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So far if c is just
something positive,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.962 align:middle line:84%
x is c plus delta over
2, then they're close.

00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Their difference,
however, is going

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to be just by this computation
equal to 2c plus delta over 2

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.250 align:middle line:90%
times delta over 2 squared.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Now delta squared over 2
is always non-negative,

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.170 align:middle line:84%
so it's certainly bigger than
or equal to delta times c.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And now remember we
wanted this thing

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:90%
to be bigger than or equal to 1.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Right now we have it's bigger
than or equal to delta c.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's choose c
to be 1 over delta,

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:90%
and let's see that that works.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Choose c to be 1 over
delta, x to be 1 over delta.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:90%
So c plus delta over 2.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.480 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Then these two values are close.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
x minus c equals delta
over 2 is less than delta,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and x squared minus c
squared equals x plus c times

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.704 align:middle line:90%
x minus c.

00:40:50.704 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:84%
x plus c as we did a minute
ago is going to be 2 over delta

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:90%
plus delta over 2.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.825 align:middle line:90%
That's x plus c.

00:41:01.825 --> 00:41:06.554 align:middle line:84%
x minus c is equal
to delta over 2,

00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:10.690 align:middle line:84%
which equals 1, plus
delta squared over 4,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:84%
which is bigger than or
equal to 1, our bad epsilon.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So f of x equals x squared is
not uniformly continuous on r,

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.483 align:middle line:84%
even though it is uniformly
continuous on this

00:41:22.483 --> 00:41:23.650 align:middle line:90%
closed and bounded interval.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So uniform continuity
is really a relationship

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
between a function and the
domain on which it's defined.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
to wrap up our theme

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:84%
of continuous functions
and how they're

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:middle line:84%
behaved on closed and
bounded intervals.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And we see here that
uniform continuity

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is a much stronger notion
than continuity, as I've said.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can easily
prove from the definition

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.480 align:middle line:84%
that if a function is
uniformly continuous on s,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.180 align:middle line:90%
then it's continuous on s.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that in general
the reverse inclusion does not

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.580 align:middle line:90%
hold.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.855 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
this up as a remark.

00:42:22.855 --> 00:42:28.351 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.351 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:84%
In general, f
uniformly continuous

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:90%
implies that f is continuous.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.165 align:middle line:84%
This just follows
from the definition.

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.415 align:middle line:90%
This is not difficult to show.

00:42:49.415 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But the converse does not
hold, as we've just seen

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We have two examples
here. f of x

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.550 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 over x on the
open interval 0, 1, which

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is continuous, but it's
not uniformly continuous;

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and then we have the function
f of x equals x squared,

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:84%
which is not uniformly
continuous on r.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it is
uniformly continuous

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.750 align:middle line:84%
on this closed and
bounded interval 0, 1.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:84%
This example here,
though, is, in fact,

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:84%
the rule; that if I'm
looking at a function

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:84%
on a closed and bounded
interval, then, in fact,

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:84%
these two notions
are equivalent.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's the following theorem.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Let f be a function
from a to b to r.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So closed and bounded interval
now, not just an arbitrary set.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Then f is continuous
on a, b, meaning

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.400 align:middle line:84%
it's continuous at
every point, if and only

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:84%
if f is uniformly
continuous on a, b.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And the necessity of working on
a closed and bounded interval

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is seen again by
this example we had

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.310 align:middle line:84%
here of f of x
equals 1 over x and f

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:44.160 align:middle line:84%
of x equals x squared
on r and 0, 1.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we're looking on
a closed and bounded interval,

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.760 align:middle line:84%
continuous is equivalent
to uniform continuity.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.355 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is also not the
sharpest thing you can say.

00:44:54.355 --> 00:44:57.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what you can
say is that if I replace

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:84%
this with what's called
a compact set, which

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.305 align:middle line:84%
I may put in the
assignment, I may not,

00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:84%
then the statement
is still true.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's in some sense
the sharpest statement.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is
interesting enough

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:84%
to just work on a closed
and bounded interval.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.655 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove this.

00:45:22.655 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I leave this to you as an
exercise, uniform continuity

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.620 align:middle line:90%
implying continuity.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.490 align:middle line:90%
I leave it to you.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I will do more
difficult one,

00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and we'll use kind
of a philosophy

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.880 align:middle line:84%
like we did in the
previous lecture

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.770 align:middle line:84%
where we use the
definition of continuity

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:84%
or this theorem about continuity
in terms of sequences and also

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.940 align:middle line:90%
the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:90%


00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We still have the
negation of the definition

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.820 align:middle line:84%
of uniform continuity, and
that's what we'll need.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
prove f continuous

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.840 align:middle line:84%
implies uniformly
continuous, and we're going

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.170 align:middle line:90%
to do this by contradiction.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So suppose f is
continuous on a, b,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.470 align:middle line:90%
but not uniformly continuous.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:47:00.820 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
break the universe some way,

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.620 align:middle line:84%
which shows that our assumption
that f is not uniformly

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:90%
continuous does not hold.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So we use this negation
of the definition

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.350 align:middle line:84%
of uniform continuity, which
says that there exists delta 0.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:31.820 align:middle line:90%
So let me write this out.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:38.890 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
rewrite this here,

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:84%
then there exists a delta
0, such that for all delta

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:50.770 align:middle line:84%
positive, there
exists x, c and a, b,

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:84%
which depend on delta, such that
x minus c is less than delta

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and f of x minus f
of c is greater than

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:90%
or equal to epsilon not.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, this holds for every delta.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You can find x and c so that
x minus c is less than delta

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and f of x minus
f of c is greater

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.690 align:middle line:90%
than or equal to epsilon not.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's choose delta to be 1
over n for each natural number

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:84%
n, and for all natural
numbers n, there exists

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:90%
xn, cn, and a, b, such that--

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.160 align:middle line:84%
so this is the statement now
with delta equals 1 over n.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.190 align:middle line:84%
xn minus cn is
less than 1 over n,

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and f of x sub n minus f of c
sub n is bigger than or equal

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.030 align:middle line:90%
to epsilon 0.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have two sequences
here, and they're

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:84%
bounded because they're in this
closed and bounded interval.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So I can pass to a subsequence
of one of them to start

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:32.410 align:middle line:84%
by the Bolzano-Weierstrass
theorem--

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.420 align:middle line:90%
not B-Z, Bolzano-Weierstrass.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably
somewhere else in the lecture

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:84%
or the previous I wrote
B-Z, but I meant B-W

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.145 align:middle line:90%
by Bolzano-Weierstrass--

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:49:44.820 --> 00:50:05.110 align:middle line:84%
there exists subsequent xn sub k
of x sub n and x and a, b, such

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that limit as k goes to infinity
of x sub n sub k equals x.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So Bolzano-Weierstrass
from any bounded sequence

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.580 align:middle line:84%
we can find a
convergent subsequence.

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And because this subsequence
is always between a and b,

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.960 align:middle line:84%
the limit x will
be between a and b.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.820 align:middle line:90%


00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the
subsequence cn sub k

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:52.990 align:middle line:90%
is bounded between a and b--

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.960 align:middle line:84%
so I have a subsequence
of x sub n sub k,

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and I then obtain a
subsequence of the c sub n

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.400 align:middle line:84%
by just picking these
integers to be the same.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:09.742 align:middle line:84%
And so now that
subsequence is of the c sub

00:51:09.742 --> 00:51:12.840 align:middle line:84%
n is they're all
coming from a, b.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's bounded by a, b.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:15.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's bounded.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So by Bolzano-Weierstrass
applied now

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:32.130 align:middle line:84%
to this subsequence, there
exists a subsequence c sub n

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:45.700 align:middle line:84%
sub k of j, of c sub n
sub k, and an element c

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:53.870 align:middle line:84%
in a, b, such that
the limit as j

00:51:53.870 --> 00:52:00.100 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of c sub
n sub k sub j equals c.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So I found a subsequence
of the x of n's, and now I

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:84%
look at a corresponding
subsequence of the c sub

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.897 align:middle line:84%
n's where now the subsequent cn
sub k's are coming from the n

00:52:16.897 --> 00:52:19.920 align:middle line:84%
sub k's chosen for this
subsequence, that's

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.790 align:middle line:90%
still a bounded sequence.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So by Bolzano-Weierstrass,
I can take

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.210 align:middle line:84%
a subsequence of
that and an element

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:90%
c so that I have convergence.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.580 align:middle line:90%
So now let me just summarize.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, the sequences
x sub n sub k of j--

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.620 align:middle line:84%
so now this is even a
subsequence of x sub n sub k

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and c sub n sub k sub j.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:27.220 align:middle line:90%


00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:36.060 align:middle line:84%
These are subsequences of
the original sequences x sub

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.751 align:middle line:90%
n and c sub n.

00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.330 --> 00:54:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And this x and c and a, b,
such that the limit as j

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:08.870 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of x sub n
sub j equals x, and limit as j

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of z
sub n sub kj equals c.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, I claim x equals c.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:37.530 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, 0 is certainly bigger than
or equal to x sub n sub k sub

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:50.660 align:middle line:84%
j minus c sub n sub k
sub j, which is less

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.050 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to by
how we've defined

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:59.600 align:middle line:84%
these sequences is less than or
equal to 1 over n sub k sub j.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:06.120 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So first off, by the
definition of subsequences,

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.430 align:middle line:84%
j is always bigger than
or equal to n sub k--

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.980 align:middle line:84%
n sub k sub j is always
bigger than or equal to j.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is always less
than or equal to 1 over j.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.450 align:middle line:84%
This is just a consequence of
how some sequences are defined.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You always have to
move to the right

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:31.910 align:middle line:84%
after you've made a choice
of entry in the sequence

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to take as
an element of your sequence.

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So 0 is bounded,
bounds this from below,

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and is bounded above by 1
over j, which converges to 0.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So the middle thing has to
converge to 0 by the squeeze

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:50.310 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:56:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But these two things,
that converges to x, this

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.290 align:middle line:90%
converges to c.

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the absolute value
of x minus c equals 0,

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and therefore x equals c.

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:29.753 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're almost home free.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:47.040 align:middle line:84%
This limit as j goes to infinity
of x sub n sub k sub j equals

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:56.200 align:middle line:84%
c, and limit as j goes
to infinity c sub n sub k

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.705 align:middle line:90%
sub j equals c.

00:56:58.705 --> 00:57:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, where's the kicker?

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.490 align:middle line:90%
This.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So these are subsequences
of x sub n and c sub n.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But each of those sequences
is converging to a number c.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So by the theorem
about continuity,

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:43.410 align:middle line:84%
since f is continuous
at c, this implies

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that 0 equals the limit
as j goes to infinity

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of f of x sub n sub--

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.350 align:middle line:90%


00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:01.160 align:middle line:84%
write it this way.
f of c minus f of c

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:17.920 align:middle line:84%
equals limit j goes to infinity
of f of n's of c sub n sub k

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.797 align:middle line:84%
sub j, which is bigger
than or equal to epsilon 0.

00:58:21.797 --> 00:58:23.380 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
supposed to be bigger

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.560 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to some fixed
epsilon 0, which is positive.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But we've just shown
that's equal to 0.

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.302 align:middle line:90%
And that's the contradiction.

00:58:36.302 --> 00:58:42.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:50.426 align:middle line:84%
Thus, f is uniformly
continuous on a, b.

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:58:55.570 --> 00:59:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So that concludes what
we'll say about continuity.

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll note
kind of going forward,

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:05.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
cover topics faster.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.270 align:middle line:84%
That's just because we have
more machinery to work with.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:14.820 align:middle line:84%
At the start it was very
slow going just because one,

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.200 align:middle line:84%
it's the start of your
first proof based class.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.445 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
go slow; and two,

00:59:19.445 --> 00:59:20.820 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have
much to work with.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We just had the
real numbers are in

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.350 align:middle line:84%
ordered field with the
least upper bound property.

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:31.260 align:middle line:84%
But now we've covered sequences,
continuity we know more,

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:37.455 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be easier to
prove new things and also

00:59:37.455 --> 00:59:41.580 align:middle line:84%
hopefully familiarity
with proofs

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:45.810 align:middle line:84%
is getting better so
that my arguments can

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:51.750 align:middle line:84%
be a little bit shorter
and not so involved.

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're moving on
to something now.

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.460 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to
be about calculus.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.060 align:middle line:84%
We've covered
limits, continuity.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:07.870 align:middle line:84%
The next big topic has
to be differentiability.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is a new chapter
about the derivative.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.530 align:middle line:90%


01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So let me first give you
the precise definition.

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So first off, I'll be
saying, let I be an interval,

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
f goes from I to R,
and c an element of I.

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I say an
interval, I don't

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
mean it has to be closed
and bounded like ones

01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.830 align:middle line:90%
we've been working on.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.945 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean it has to be open.

01:01:01.945 --> 01:01:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be a bounded
interval like from 0 to 1.

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.420 align:middle line:90%
It could be 0 to infinity.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It can include the endpoints,
except, of course, infinity.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
I mean and I don't

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
have to write all this out for
what exactly an interval is.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
So let I be an interval and f
be a function from I to R and c

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.700 align:middle line:90%
a point of I.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:30.047 align:middle line:84%
So first off, convince
yourselves of this,

01:01:30.047 --> 01:01:31.630 align:middle line:84%
but I think it should
be pretty clear.

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:41.090 align:middle line:90%


01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
For an interval, every
point in the interval

01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
is a cluster point
of the interval.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
This is not too
difficult to prove.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And I will not require
you to prove it,

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just saying
this because I'm

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:58.350 align:middle line:90%
about to define a limit at c.

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So it had better be a
cluster point of a set

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
that this limit
is defined using.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
So of I, take away c.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.820 align:middle line:90%


01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
like the statement,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
just forget I even wrote
it and we'll continue on.

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.314 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.314 --> 01:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
You say f is
differentiable at c--

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
so this is the new
bit of terminology.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
If the limit x goes to c, f of
x minus f of c over x minus c

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
exists.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
If this limit exists, we say the
functions differentiable at c,

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and we use a notation f prime
f apostrophe c for this limit.

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
If f is differentiable at
every point of the interval I,

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
we'd get a new
function, this function

01:03:51.870 --> 01:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
f prime of c, which we
denote the function that's

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
a derivative of f
as f prime or dfdx.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:24.550 align:middle line:90%


01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So the simplest guys that are
differential are, of course,

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
polynomials.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one of the
first things you learn back

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
in calculus.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to go through what

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
this is supposed to represent.

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You know this from
calculus, the best way

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to say what this
number represents

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
is the instantaneous rate
of change of the function

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.340 align:middle line:90%
f at this point.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
How is f changing at that point
in the sense of increasing,

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.150 align:middle line:90%
decreasing, and so on?

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.340 align:middle line:90%


01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Or if you like,
you interpret this

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
as being the slope
of the line that

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly
tangent to the curve

01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:06.550 align:middle line:90%
to the graph of the function f.

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But what does that mean
to be tangent to the graph

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of a function?

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So that takes a
bit of explaining.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to get into
what the actual interpretation

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.993 align:middle line:90%
of this number is.

01:05:22.993 --> 01:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a pretty
good idea of what that is.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to start
proving some properties of it.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So the simplest
example of a function

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
which is differentiable
is that of a monomial.

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:50.925 align:middle line:90%
So f of x equals x to the n.

01:05:50.925 --> 01:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's put even a
number in there.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's write it this way.

01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Let f have been R in
the natural number 0,

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
then function f of x equals
alpha times x to the n

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.470 align:middle line:90%
is differentiable.

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:22.176 align:middle line:90%


01:06:22.176 --> 01:06:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So I should have
said here as well

01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
if a function is
differentiable at every point

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
where it's defined,
or if a function is

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.550 align:middle line:84%
differentiable at every
point in its domain I,

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
then we just say the
function is differentiable.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So then this monomial is
differential and for all

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:54.225 align:middle line:84%
c f prime of c equals n times
alpha x to the n minus 1, c.

01:06:54.225 --> 01:07:02.790 align:middle line:90%


01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's give a proof
of that, and we'll

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.995 align:middle line:90%
use this kind of simple formula.

01:07:10.995 --> 01:07:15.710 align:middle line:90%


01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at x minus c times

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
this kind of weird looking
sum to x, n minus 1 minus j,

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.460 align:middle line:90%
c to the j.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:39.350 align:middle line:90%


01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So multiply the x
through, I get sum from j

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 to n minus 1, x to the
n minus j, c to the j minus--

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to use
j again in the sum when

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I carry this c through.

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to use l--

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
sum from l equals 0 to n
minus 1, x to the n minus--

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:21.479 align:middle line:84%
I'll put it this way-- j
plus 1, c to the j plus 1, l,

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm going to make
a change of variables

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
in this second sum and
let j equals l plus 1.

01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.910 align:middle line:90%


01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, when l
equals 0, j starts at 1.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.100 align:middle line:84%
When l hits n minus
1, j equals n.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So this equals the sum from
j equals 0, n minus 1, x,

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
n minus j, c to the j minus sum
j equals 1 to n, x, n minus j,

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
c to the j.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same
terms in the sum,

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
except starting at
different places.

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:08.069 align:middle line:84%
So what doesn't
get killed here is

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:12.779 align:middle line:84%
the j equals 0 term because
this one starts at j equals 1.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.279 align:middle line:90%
This one ends at n.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it kills
the n minus 1 term.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that
survives from this sum

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
is the j equals 0 term, x to
the n minus 0, c to the 0 minus.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.305 align:middle line:90%


01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And now from here, everything
gets killed except the n terms.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So x to the n
minus n, c to the n

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
equals x to the n
minus c to the n.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is therefore
equal to this.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.130 align:middle line:90%


01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So we use this to
compute this limit.

01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So then f prime of c
is equal to the limit

01:09:56.730 --> 01:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c of
x to the n alpha

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:07.060 align:middle line:84%
times x to the n times
alpha times c to the n,

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
where x minus c--

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.760 align:middle line:90%
now, alpha is just a number.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.450 align:middle line:90%
It can pop out--

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
x to the n minus c to the
n divided by x minus c

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
is this thing
divided by x minus c.

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to alpha times
the limit as x goes to c of sum

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
from j equals 0 to n minus 1,
x to the n minus 1 minus j, c

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.540 align:middle line:90%
to the j.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just
a polynomial in x.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Polynomials are
continuous functions.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So the limit as x goes to c
is just to plug in c to x.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this equals
alpha times sum from j

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 to n minus 1, c to
the n minus 1 minus j times

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.230 align:middle line:90%
j equals--

01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
so c to the n minus 1
minus j times c to the j

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.210 align:middle line:90%
gives me c to the n minus 1--

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm summing in j.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
There's no j here, so
that just pops out--

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%


01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
times the sum j
equals 0, n minus 1.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.510 align:middle line:90%
And there's n of the times 1.

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:20.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is just n.

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:24.275 align:middle line:90%


01:11:24.275 --> 01:11:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's the proof.

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:27.960 align:middle line:90%


01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure you saw
that at some point.

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Next time we'll give an example
of a function which is not

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:37.440 align:middle line:90%
differentiable out of a point.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I think you
probably already know

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
this, f of x equals the
absolute value of x.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
If there's time at
some point, I'll

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:50.570 align:middle line:84%
go over an example
of a function, which

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
was very surprising to
people at one point.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So now that we have
differentiability

01:11:54.350 --> 01:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and continuity on the board, for
a long time since dead people

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
believed that if you have
a continuous function,

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
any continuous
function, then there

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
has to be at least one point
where it's differentiable.

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
There must be at least one
point where it's differentiable.

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And people tried to prove
that for a long time

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't
because it's false.

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Weierstrass, who was, again kind
of the godfather of everything

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
we're doing, came up with
a whole class of examples

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
of functions that
are continuous,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.470 align:middle line:90%
but are differentiable nowhere.

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They're not differentiable
at a single point.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps depending on time,
will go over this example.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And think I'll stop there.

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:55.000 align:middle line:90%

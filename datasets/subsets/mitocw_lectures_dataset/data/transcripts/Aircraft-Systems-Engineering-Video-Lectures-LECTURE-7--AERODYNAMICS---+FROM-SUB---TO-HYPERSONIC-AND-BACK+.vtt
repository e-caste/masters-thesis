WEBVTT

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.350
A couple things.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.390
First of all, this is for those of you who
are working on GN&C for your projects.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.530
I have spoken with Phil Hattis from Draper
Lab, who is going to be giving the lecture

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.989
on GN&C, but he is not giving the lecture
until the third of November.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.059
Now, that is kind of late.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.780
And so I asked him if he would be willing
to meet with all of you who are working on

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.079
GN&C just so you could talk with him and ask
questions.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.300
If you want him to give you a short version
of his presentation that he's going to give

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.530
in November, he can do that.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.530
But he is our in-house resident expert.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.530
And I figured it's better if you get a chance
to talk to him early.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.240
He has some time free tomorrow and he has
some time next week.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
He is out of town through today.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280
I know we have two teams working on GN&C.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.500
If you guys want to get together and find
out if there is some time when you could all

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.950
meet with Phil, I will give you his contact
information.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.210
He says he is happy to do it.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.140
It would be much more convenient, from his
point of view, if you could all see him at

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.869
the same time and talk about it together.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.289
Let me know what you come up with.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.579
But, as I say, he is happy to do it.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.500
Second thing.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.470
There was an interview printed in US Today,
which I have posted on the class website with

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.289
Mike Griffin, the administrator.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.520
And it says NASA administrator says space
shuttle was a mistake.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.780
And so the question was what do we intend
to do about that in this class?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.780
Well, let me actually read the specific words
that Griffin uses because I think that's important.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.519
Griffin said my opinion is that the Shuttle
was a design which was extremely aggressive

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.870
and just barely possible.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.579
And that's actually, I think, a slightly different
way of looking at this.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.579
I mean I would also say that Apollo was a
project that was extremely aggressive and

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.550
just barely possible.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.340
And I think that it is actually NASA's business
to do things which are aggressive and just

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.430
barely possible.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.430
Now, whether it was the right decision for
the country to abandon the Exploration Program

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.930
after Apollo and do the Shuttle and then later
on the Space Station that's more, I think,

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.780
in the political realm.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.780
And, as I think you've heard both from Dale
Myers and John Logsdon, that, in fact, there

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.959
were political determining factors which didn't
really give NASA a lot of choice.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.959
Just to remind you, the basic point of this
course is not the political and economic history

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.379
of the shuttle.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.980
It's a technical exploration of how we did
the shuttle.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.670
I think we would all agree that the concept
of the Shuttle was extremely aggressive and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.849
the technology was being stretched and it
was just barely possible.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.409
And, yet, we did it.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.159
And the idea of this course is to understand
how we did it and how the systems work.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.909
I think it will be interesting, when we get
towards the end of the course, maybe we'll

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.720
sit down and relax and instead of having,
I think there are two kinds of open sessions

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.849
towards the end that I've been thinking about
what we want to do there.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.810
And in one of them I think we may just talk
a little bit and reflect on what we've learned,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.269
and that will give us an opportunity to discuss
issues like this.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.340
That's all I'm going to say about this.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.579
I don't propose that we discuss this further
today because we really are fortunate to have

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.690
Bass Redd.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.470
And Aaron Cohen is going to introduce him
formally.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.470
I will just say that when I was at Johnston
Space Center last spring and I met one of

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.720
the older managers there and I was telling
him about our plans for this course and how

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.009
Aaron was going to be a visiting professor
here and we were inviting some of the experts

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.009
in the early design of the Shuttle, he said,
well, there is one guy you absolutely have

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.550
to get, and that's Bass Redd.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.550
Well, we've got him.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.419
We're very fortunate.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.659
And, Aaron, I will turn it over to you and
let you explain a little bit more why we're

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.990
so fortunate.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.990
Well, first I have to tell you how I found
Bass.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.330
I had a hard time finding Bass.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.419
He lives in a placed called Smithville, Texas.

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:19.139
And, when people ask him where Smithville,
Texas is, he said it's about a few minutes

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.800
after you pass resume speed.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.240
So, it's not a very well known place.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.220
But I finally found Bass.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.990
And he is truly an outstanding aerodynamicist.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.990
And the thing that is so important is that
aerodynamics, to me, from my vantage point,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.210
is really the linchpin, you might say, of
putting a system together.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.229
Aerodynamics makes the system come alive.

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.850
And as you could hear from the various speakers,
from Tom Moser, and we talked a little bit

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.680
about the guidance, navigation and control,
it's important for the structures.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.740
Aerodynamics is important for the structures,
it's important for the flight control system,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.330
it's important for the hydraulic system and
it's important for the heating system.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.330
So, you have to understand the aerodynamics
before you can make the vehicle actually come

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.139
alive.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.860
And Bass Redd is the man to do it.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.069
He is absolutely one of the great aerodynamicists
of our times.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:23.110
And he started out before there was computational
fluid dynamics and the old wind tunnel testing.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.930
And now there is computational fluid dynamics,
so you're going to be in for a real treat

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.889
today to hear how Bass Redd put both the Apollo
together, he did the Apollo aerodynamics,

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.319
and he also did the Shuttle aerodynamics.

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.729
And he is also now consulting to help NASA
do their future work.

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.150
Let me now turn it over to Bass.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.389
Thank you, Aaron.

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.630
It's a great honor to be with you this morning.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.630
And you sure do look young.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:03.500
[LAUGHTER] We will try to cover basically
-- [STATIC OBSCURES] And with that overview

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:59.889
then of the Orbiter is how the program requirements
drove the aerodynamic configuration, probably

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.509
the biggest thing in what the aerodynamic
characteristics are driven by the program

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:08.270
requirements.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.080
And that will make a little more sense after
we get into the briefing.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:19.080
Then the aerodynamic considerations, those
that aren't due to program requirements but

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:23.590
just due to the basic fundamentals of aerodynamics
and the configuration that is being evaluated.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.840
We will do that for both the Orbiter and the
Integrated Vehicle.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.520
Then I'll try to tell you how the aerodynamic
design was accomplished through each of those

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.870
phases, a lot of ways to work problems.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:46.030
Early on having powerful tools or sometimes
a curse to you because you can produce more

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.420
data than the system can consume.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:56.420
And I remember when we first got started on
the Shuttle design, the people from structures

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:04.000
had just finished the NASTRAN on the Apollo
and they immediately wanted enough data to

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.279
put into the NASTRAN for every configuration
that was being conceived.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:12.750
That's not really a smart thing to do when
you have literally hundreds of configurations

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.700
to be considered.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:20.700
We will try to talk to you about phases, phase
A, B and C, and defining the problem areas.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.649
And then defining the aerodynamic characteristics
and do just a quick summary of the wind tunnel

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.890
test program.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.300
And with some comments on how CFD might have
driven that were it available.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.300
Through the `60s and `80s these design studies
were accomplished in phases.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.959
Phase A is primarily in-house civil service
design.

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:47.269
I don't know how well you understand the NASA
part, what the contractor part, what the civil

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:52.920
service part is, but phase A is primarily
in-house civil service.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:59.920
Whenever the contractors began to feel that
this might be a real program, they began to

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.990
do their in-house studies and they began to
visit and give us recommendations and ideas

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.149
on their own to drive that.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:10.470
None of that is paid for.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.370
That's a gratuitous kind of a thing.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:19.930
And contractors have a bit of change set aside
to do those kinds of studies, but it's a freebee

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.730
and really a super way to do things.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.970
And that's still going on today.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:33.120
Phase B is then you give contracts for generic
studies.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.120
Scopes out the concept feasibilities and the
program requirements and does those trades,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.010
does projected cost and timelines.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:51.010
By the way, before I forget it, Humboldt Mandell
on costing would be excellent.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:58.540
We worked quite close hand-in-hand on trying
to get those requirements and cost run together

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.120
along with the weight.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.329
NASA then, after they get through this phase
B, they produce a detailed statement of work

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:13.329
that
is required for the phase C and D.

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:20.339
And then phase C and D is the design and development.

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:22.920
The Air Force separated those two.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.610
NASA always sort of put those together.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.380
So the design, development and construction.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.110
And the contractors do the detail work.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.130
NASA manages and checks it.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.850
Usually the way we operate, at least in our
area, the aerodynamic area, we had a crack

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:44.019
team that would go back in and define the
problem, a potential solution to that problem

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:50.399
and then suggest to the contractor they might
look at this way or that way.

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.649
But they really put the muscle to it.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:54.690
They put the final studies.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.730
They have the design documentation.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:05.730
And we try to steer that train as those things
happen.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:13.040
In the Shuttle now, phase A, we started in
1969, just shortly after the Lunar landing,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.490
they put together a small team.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.670
And this is at Johnson Space Craft Center.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.910
And that's through my knothole and the way
that I look at things.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.860
But we did end up being the lead center in
the shuttle.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.480
But we started with a small E&D group that
was headed by a fellow by the name of Jim

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.730
Chamberlain.
Jim Chamberlain was the one that was responsible
for the Gemini Space Craft, a very unique

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:42.139
individual gone to heaven to be with the Lord
now, reviewed by Max Faget who was head of

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:50.079
E&D and Bob Gilruth who was center director,
but that was a real privilege to work with

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:50.490
him.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.579
What came out of that initial phase A study
is what the vehicle should be, is a small

00:12:55.579 --> 00:13:02.579
personnel vehicle with a four man crew, 10k
payload landing on the runway with about 200

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.850
nautical miles cross-range.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.579
Quite different from the shuttle that we have
today, but that was during the phase A.

00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:14.779
Strong design modules in this time were developed.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:21.779
And, showing how the other program requirements
go with the design, the size and the program

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:29.450
cost, there were individuals who had in their
databank, which consisted of books that they

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:37.740
kept on their tables, were all of the aircraft,
all of the spacecraft, all of the missiles,

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:46.019
what the weight of every individual subsystem
was based upon plots with ECLS's on how much

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:53.440
heat they took out, on the avionics as to
how many computations they made.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.370
Well, not to chase that rabbit too far, but
basically they were down to the subsystem

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.079
kind of level.

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.769
And then with the primary structure, secondary
structure, how that was affected by landed

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:10.000
weights or entry weights, the thermal protection
system.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.420
And it was amazing what a good job that kind
of approach would do.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:21.550
And then we had point designs that were being
looked at both in-house at Johnson Space Craft

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.860
Center, at Marshall and by all the contractors.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.980
And then all that data was fed into the system.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.579
So, that was a designed database.

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:33.709
Some of those have been automated now and
pretty good.

00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:37.579
And they don't give you the right answers,
but the answers they give you aren't very

00:14:37.579 --> 00:14:38.870
far wrong either.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:44.029
They get into the ballpark for you.

00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:48.350
Phase B started in 1971.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.980
Something happened.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.389
The requirements were not dictated by NASA.

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:57.269
The requirements were dictated by the Air
Force, at least the driving requirements.

00:14:57.269 --> 00:15:00.990
If we had our own, a small vehicle it would
have satisfied that.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:07.990
The Air Force requirements were 55,000 pound
payload, 60 foot long payload bay, 15 foot

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.910
in diameter, it had to be returned with a
1200 nautical mile cross-range.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.430
At least 32,000 pounds of it had to be returned.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.019
It was classified at that time.

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:23.860
It is no longer classified.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.790
You can use your imagination to figure out
what kind of payload that you would want to

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.360
go up into a high inclination orbit and bring
back in one pass.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.050
Where that would take you and why you'd have
to get back that quickly.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:42.639
But those were the requirements that were
fed into phase B.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:46.000
Maximum reusability did not come from the
Air Force.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.050
That came from the NASA side as that was part
of technology.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.570
NASA has two basic jobs to do.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:58.199
One is the design of the vehicle, the delivering
of the hardware, accomplishing the mission,

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:04.740
but the other requirement for NASA is that
it increased the technology.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.829
Going where no man has gone before, yes, but
doing things that man has not done before

00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:11.350
in a better, faster way.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:18.350
And so maximum reusability was a goal that
the engineers were handed.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.860
Soft ride.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.730
They wanted to be able to a congressman or
a senator up in it.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.070
[LAUGHTER] A neat thing.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.029
Multi-center participation.

00:16:31.029 --> 00:16:34.259
If you ever get Hum up here, that cost you.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:41.259
Any time you break a job down and give it
to more than one center or more than one contractor,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.730
it's like Humpty-Dumpty, you break him apart,
you've got to put him back together again.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:51.529
And it takes a lot of eyes and elbows on both
sides to accomplish that.

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:56.389
And basically, once you break something down,
you've increased your cost by 30% to 40% to

00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:58.420
put it back together again.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:05.420
Now, NASA has to have, under congressional
mandate, contracts in every state in the union.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:15.849
Multi-center participation drives a great
number of things so I felt it needed to be

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:19.270
on the chart.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:26.270
But the big thing that you need to know as
engineers, sometimes you cannot set your own

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.419
program requirements.

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:31.360
They are dictated to you for strange reasons.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.120
And you have to play the hand that you're
dealt.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.270
Phase C and D, we had four contractors that
bid on phase C and D.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.870
The interesting thing is Rockwell was the
only contractor that bid within the allocated

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.070
funds.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.720
They also had the best proposal, but that
was very interesting.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.419
What they did was use the aerodynamic database
that was developed in phase A and in phase

00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:01.820
B for their design analysis.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.789
They augmented that, they did some in-house
testing, and Rockwell said we can do it for

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:11.450
that amount of money but only if you don't
change anything, NASA.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.520
And we changed things.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.460
They had a smaller orbiter, and we rejected
that very early on.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.880
It had no capability for weight growth.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.809
And we showed that every program that has
ever existed grew in weight by at least 5%,

00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:29.179
10%, 15%.

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:34.309
And so the Orbiter was sized up just a little
bit larger than the one that they had proposed

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:36.580
with their agreement.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.640
Aaron probably had a contract change authorization
because of that.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.280
But, anyway, we did that right at the beginning.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:50.280
What we did also aerodynamically during that
phase B is we developed a complete database

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:58.740
in the nation's best facility to be used for
what we call verification analysis.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:05.740
And that database is very well documented,
and we will talk about that a little bit more.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:09.710
Program requirements.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:16.400
May I ask, before you go onto program requirements,
could you say something about kind of, you

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.970
talked about the aerodynamic database, but
nowadays we've got a lot of information about

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:19.320
hypersonic aerodynamics?

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:26.320
Can you say a little bit about the state of
the art?

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:29.970
What did people really know?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I'm going to do that
when we go through it by phases specifically.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.350
I'm kind of telling it to you like a mystery
story.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:43.169
[LAUGHTER] The program requirements dictated
the basic orbiter configuration, payload size,

00:19:43.169 --> 00:19:48.390
crew size and returning the payload bay, the
engine.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:53.960
Now, if you just visualize in your mind, and
it's kind of a two-chart thing, let me just

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.210
jump over to that since I know how to go back
now.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:04.000
If you've got a payload that's got to be that
long and you've got a crew size and the crew

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.010
takes at least one telephone booth's worth
of volume per crew takes at least one telephone

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.500
booths worth of volume per crew, Even Superman
needed something that big.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.059
[LAUGHTER] You've got the volume of this.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:15.850
Engines in the back.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.640
You want to return that because engines are
very, very expensive.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.720
The avionics, of course, you want to bring
those back.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.870
They are very, very expensive.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:28.840
And you've got to have it pointy end first.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.309
You looked at that and said, boy, you didn't
have much choice as far as the fuselage was

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:33.559
concerned.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.059
And that's right, you really don't.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:41.929
Now, that's pretty well set.

00:20:41.929 --> 00:20:48.929
Now, the wing size is required to augment
the body lift.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.799
Now, if you just had the body on there, it
would have to land about 300 knots.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:57.850
We didn't have wheel tires and breaks to land
at that those speeds so we had to have some

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.909
more lift.

00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:05.289
And that was accommodated with a wing.

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:06.520
Figure out what CL max is.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.750
They're all about the same.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.679
You like a delta wing because it's a little
more nice from a heat transfer standpoint.

00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:16.270
Sure a whole lot nicer if you've got to go
through supersonic and transonic conditions

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.070
at low angles of attack.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.960
So, you've got a delta wing that you want
to have on there.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.110
You don't have much choice on the size of
that.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.700
Airflow by the way 12% thick.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.070
That makes it nice for the structures people.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.520
Still does a super job aerodynamically, too.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.690
And so that's pretty well dictated.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:44.960
Then the entry angle of attack is dictated
by the hypersonic L/D required for the cross-range.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.980
And you can go through your equations, Newtonian
aerodynamics sign or the exposed area, and

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.450
the then L/D, the tangents.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:59.030
And so you've got the hypersonic aerodynamics
from that angle of attack required for the

00:21:59.030 --> 00:21:59.870
cross-range.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:06.870
The wing shape to balance the configuration
for the aft CG and acceptable wing leading

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.429
edge heating.

00:22:08.429 --> 00:22:13.950
In other words, we can position that wing
at the right place for the center of gravity

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.659
that we have which, by the way, even in phase
A is known pretty well didn't change much.

00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:24.890
The control services was the magic thing.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:31.200
With the payload in and out 1.5% CG changed.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.059
There has only been one other aerodynamic
vehicle that has ever been built that has

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:37.510
a CG of 1.5% of body length.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.130
That was a B-36.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.630
And this vehicle had to have the 1.5% change
in the center of gravity because of payload

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.500
in/ payload out.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.010
And you can try to stack it together in many
different ways.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.350
That's just as good as you can do.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.549
That dictated the size of the control services
to accommodate that.

00:22:58.549 --> 00:23:00.320
They are very big.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.500
They are barn doors.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.929
It makes it nice for controlling the vehicle.

00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:10.049
Oh, and the vertical tail, we'll talk about
that.

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:11.700
That's for crosswind landings.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.330
But the way, most all the vehicles that you've
seen from overseas that have been proposed

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.690
cannot land in a crosswind.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.190
I don't know what they are going to do.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.240
They don't have enough control service to
land in the crosswind.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.179
But that dictated the vertical tail size.

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:33.179
Now, as you kind of go around the loop on
those things, some potential items that we

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.620
probably want to point out here is the body
shape.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.809
We've already basically talked about it.

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:43.419
Nose shape, that's pretty straight forward.

00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:50.419
The basic Orbiter shape didn't really change
from phase A through phase C and D.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.860
We blended the OMS pot a little bit because
we didn't want it to interfere with the payload

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:04.500
bay door which was built by a different set
of groups.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:11.320
The delta wing, we put a little crank in it,
a double delta, and got a little more subsonic

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.380
lift.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.929
And we didn't have the body flap moving to
start with, but we found that it was a very

00:24:17.929 --> 00:24:24.929
powerful control of which assisted the center
of gravity movement.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:34.900
The full-spanned elevons were needed to control
the center of pressure for hypersonics.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.260
And there are other little things there, and
you can read those through at your convenience,

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.610
but those are just basic things that you have
to do.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.799
And we will comment on some of those a little
bit later.

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:53.470
The Integrated Vehicle, the launch vehicle,
if you please, what do the program requirements

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.799
do to it?

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:58.970
Well, the Orbiter was sized for that payload
bay weight.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:59.590
It had to land.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.320
It had to enter.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.990
We knew the weights pretty well.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:10.710
The 150k pound Orbiter, the 65k pound payload
dictated the requirements of the Orbiter injected

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.960
weight.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.919
You add them up.

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:14.429
You've got to get it into orbit.

00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:19.700
Once around at the high inclination and return
to the launch site set the Orbiter performance

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:19.950
requirements.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.990
We had to have a certain amount of energy
available from the propulsion system.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:30.990
Maximum hardware reusability mixed with a
cost consideration yielded a stage and a half

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.240
vehicle.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.080
And I will talk to you about that in just
a minute.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:42.000
But the cost constraints, there was a great
move afoot to have a return to the launch

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.460
site booster, manned booster, if you please,
but the cost and constraints and the size

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.890
of the vehicle got pretty big.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:58.890
The wing vehicle loads were significantly
reduced by the parallel burn.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:08.260
You've got the orbiter tucked in between the
solid rocket boosters and the external tank

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.840
versus an orbiter that would be on the end.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:18.110
It makes a great difference in the structural
loads that the aerodynamics produces.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:23.940
Solid rocket booster mismatch decreased or
dictated an increased beta dispersion.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:30.270
Typically on an end-to-end vehicle you've
got everything kind of tucked in pretty tightly.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.659
On this one the SRBs are spread, any mismatch
at burnout and we had some big beta dispersions

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:37.700
that still haunt us a little bit today.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.080
Soft ride requirement.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.169
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:26:40.169 --> 00:26:42.250
I just don't know what a beta dispersion is.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.669
You don't know what a beta dispersion is.

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:46.220
All right.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.659
[LAUGHTER] Angle of attack.

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:52.230
Angle the size of it, beta.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:58.400
Alpha, beta, standard aerodynamic definition.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.070
Which, by the way, brings me to a comment.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.070
We've been asked to chase a rabbit with you
here.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:13.070
I would suggest very highly that you get yourself
a NASA dictionary where standard terms that

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.730
your bosses will use because they've been
using them for years.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:21.960
[LAUGHTER] That you do that.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.080
And I'm not fussing at you at all.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.279
You can get a little gray book that's called
the NASA Dictionary.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:31.559
And you will know what alpha and betas are.

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:33.400
CMQ plus CM alpha dots.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.080
All those standards terms are defined.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.240
Flutter.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.399
Buffet.

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:43.149
And you will really look sharp when you know
what he's saying.

00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:44.960
[LAUGHTER] All right.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.179
Go ahead.

00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:53.179
I know there are some people here who didn't
go through aero-astro, and so may have actually

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.480
not had a full course in aerodynamics.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.070
Hopefully most of you have had it.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.710
But any time there are expressions or terms
you don't understand just do ask and we'll

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.690
bring you up to speed.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:06.360
And that NASA dictionary, by the way, covers
not just aerodynamics.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.990
It covers all kinds of other vocabulary kinds
of things that your peers will be using and

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.110
your supervisors will be using and you will
know what they're talking about.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:23.330
Soft ride requirements, that caused us to
go to a real low dynamic pressure which is

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.000
nice.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Most vehicles are up around 1200 pounds per
square foot dynamic pressure.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.200
This one is down around 800.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.370
And the reason that came about is lesser G
loads early on.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.520
SRB flare angle, no big deal there.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.090
Plume effects have really ate up aerodynamics.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:50.570
To this day that is the only thing aerodynamically
that we still don't know how to predict or

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:55.740
the base pressure due to plume effects through
the subsonic and supersonic speed regime.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.679
CFD gets it right every now and then.

00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:03.220
Sometimes it doesn't get it right.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.750
And the wind tunnel test still hadn't got
it right with solid plumes.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:14.750
All the scaling parameters that you use still
don't produce, to me, what a real valid answer

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.000
is.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.470
The flight data is used, and we update that.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.590
Yes, sir.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:22.130
When you say flare angle, do you mean like
in the stack away from the Orbiter?

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.380
Yes, sir.
This flare angle right back here.

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:32.039
We found that if you set that right, it pretty
well sets the flow and the plumes behave themselves.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:39.440
If you set that too small the plumes will
change greatly with mach numbers, sometimes

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.440
in an unpredictable fashion, so that SRB skirt
size was primarily from that consideration.

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:57.460
This is real precious to Aaron's heart.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.250
We changed the tank shape early in phase C
and D.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:08.309
And remember I told you that we had developed
a database during phase B that would suffice

00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:14.090
and we could go immediately into the design
and development of the total stack?

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:19.529
By the way, I like the ogive.

00:30:19.529 --> 00:30:22.789
It's a lot prettier than the cone that we
had on the front end.

00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:27.020
But basically what that did, that changed
the aerodynamics of the whole stack.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.539
And the data that was delivered to structure
for their structural analysis, the data that

00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:34.450
was delivered to the heating people for their
heat transfer analysis had to be done all

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.480
over again.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.860
That's a year and a half cycle from the time
you say let's go build a model, let's get

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:48.860
the data, let's analyze it.

00:30:49.179 --> 00:30:56.179
The other thing that happened when we changed
the tank, everybody took note of that, and

00:31:01.429 --> 00:31:04.980
there are all kinds of other small changes
that jumped on.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.980
[LAUGHTER] On the Orbiter a little bit, on
the external tank, on the SRBs and on the

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:20.519
inclination that we had between the Orbiter
and the tank.

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:27.519
Let me just hit some things I think that you
want to take note of on this one.

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:35.130
I guess the nose shape, we mentioned that
one already, reduces the drag.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.480
It also reduces the loads.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.340
We have to worry about the punch loads between
the SRB and the tank.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.950
And those aerodynamics are driven quite a
bit by that nose shape.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:51.470
The SRB locations fore and aft, there is some
adjustment that you can have in that, and

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:58.140
those are all optimized that whenever we do
the aerodynamics that puts a minimum amount

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.090
of load into the system.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:07.260
Orbiter instance angle, that's the angle between
the Orbiter and the external tank.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.600
It drives the stability of the configuration
to some degree.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.539
But, more than that, it drove the loads quite
a bit into the program.

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:17.480
And that was optimized.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:24.480
Full span elevators, we use those to adjust
the pitching moments so we get minimum change

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:31.700
required to trim the vehicle from the SRBs,
solid rocket boosters, and the SSMEs, the

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.110
main shuttle engines.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:42.110
SSME, plume effects and the plume effects
from the SRB, that's the only thing that we

00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:51.549
got a bad grade on as far as predicting aerodynamics
on either the Orbiter or the Integrated Vehicle.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:59.970
All the rest of the stuff came out just about
as we had predicted.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.429
Now, getting back to where you asked the question.

00:33:04.429 --> 00:33:05.929
Phase A.

00:33:05.929 --> 00:33:06.630
Go back now.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:07.559
What is a phase A?

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:10.309
That is the conceptual design.

00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:13.570
We had all kinds of configurations because
we had all kinds of requirements.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:18.399
We really didn't know what those were, and
so that analysis had to be done.

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.419
Many, many vehicles.

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:22.350
A lot of considerations.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:27.740
The analytical techniques we used to identify
problem areas.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.529
Hypersonics, quite frankly in phase A.

00:33:31.529 --> 00:33:38.529
Newtonian vehicle shape was approximated with
flat plates.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.919
Works great on a configuration.

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:50.760
[LAUGHTER] That's pretty much like a vehicle
that is kind of trimmed out of a piece of

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.899
a sphere, if you please.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:34:01.899
And those aerodynamic characteristics were
very good.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:12.190
As a matter of fact, the thing is laid out
on graph paper and you counted the squares

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.850
and saw where the CG was and what things had
to be.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.940
And it worked.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.649
It worked.

00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:21.040
Now, we didn't know that it was working at
that time.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.679
But we found out later that it did.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.250
But that's what we used.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.780
[LAUGHTER] NASA documentation.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:33.329
NASA had pretty good TNs on vehicles that
were somewhat similar.

00:34:33.329 --> 00:34:36.918
And the characteristics of those, we made
the adjustments because of the difference

00:34:36.918 --> 00:34:38.489
in configuration.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:43.589
The Air Force had a document called Dataman.

00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:47.639
It was unpublished at that time, but we got
a preliminary draft that we worked through

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.179
by hand.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.349
By the way, this is a published thing.

00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:54.040
I would suggest very highly if aerodynamics
is going to be your forte is that you learn

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.659
how to use that program.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.680
It's Dataman Aerodynamics Handbook.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.599
Navel Ordinance had a handbook out.

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:06.849
They've never computerized theirs, but it's
the Handbook of Supersonic Aerodynamics and

00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:10.470
good-old Horner's fluid dynamics lift and
drag.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:17.470
It is still around today, still use it, but
those were the aerodynamic methods that we

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.920
used during phase day.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.000
And we also did small scale wind tunnel tests
and those things that were the problem areas.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.690
And the problem areas were primarily in the
transition.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.740
Yes, sir.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.869
I can understand how you can do wind tunnel
testing.

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:36.810
What about plume effects?

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:40.430
You said you didn't understand those.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.849
How do you test that experimentally?

00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:50.849
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] No, that's done in
a wind tunnel.

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:58.589
Some people said you need to match momentum
on a scale vehicle.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:07.390
Certain other characteristics.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:12.230
What you'd like to do is be able to simulate
it with a solid plume, so we did solid plume

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.300
testing.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.089
We had method of characteristics back then.

00:36:15.089 --> 00:36:19.839
It took it about three weeks to run, to get
the plume sizes, and they did a pretty good

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:20.760
job.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.660
But when you have the plume sizes you still
after the base effects change in the pitching

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.000
moment.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.460
And so we did the solid plumes.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.900
And we did gaseous plumes at Ames Research
Center.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.420
We did cold gas and hot gas.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:36.220
But none of those met all the scaling parameters.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:41.510
When you rolled all that up and you did the
best you could, we still missed base pressure.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:45.200
Base pressure was missed on Saturn 5.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.200
Base pressure was missed on Mercury.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.770
Base pressure was missed on Little Joe II
and Little Joe I.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.900
Every launch vehicle that I could find we
missed base pressure on.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.250
We missed base pressure on the Shuttle also.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:07.410
Not a big effect, but it is embarrassing that
you cannot get it right.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:14.410
But this was done primarily more in phase
C and D than in the phase A time period.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:21.079
We just kind of said plumes are going to be
about that much based upon data from other

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:21.780
vehicles.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:28.210
And then making sure that it was not a design
driver or design stopper, if you please, that

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:32.579
it wasn't going to be a problem that was so
big that it changed things so greatly that

00:37:32.579 --> 00:37:34.599
your performance wasn't adequate.

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:36.609
And we had margins and everything.

00:37:36.609 --> 00:37:40.020
Anyway, we did some small scale testing.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.130
Phase B.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.839
What did we do on the Shuttle on phase B?

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:48.609
We went into phase B with four major configurations.

00:37:48.609 --> 00:37:51.790
Three externally identical configurations
with swing wings.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:52.790
It was called the Triamese.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.240
And I think General Dynamics was the one that
proposed that one.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.119
They have all bought on another, and it's
hard to find out who is who any longer.

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:03.880
But, anyway, that was one of the concepts.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.930
Very, very expensive.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.750
The swing wings, never really solved those
problems.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:16.650
Lockheed had a large single stage blended
body, kind of an HL-10 looking thing with

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.930
a flat bottom, and then with a large external
tank around.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.440
And I couldn't find pictures of all this to
show you, but that was one that came in.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.130
And then the two-stage fully reusable with
both the first and the second stages being

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.230
runway landers, a very favorite of Marshall.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:37.230
And then, the one that we called the stage
and a half where you're literally burning

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:42.670
the first stage boosters and the second stage
engines at the same time with the external

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:48.680
tank, we referred to that as a stage and a
half with parallel burn which is the current

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.150
shuttle.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:54.910
But those are the things that we started phase
B in and did aerodynamic designs on all those.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.540
How did we do that?

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.730
Well, we had gotten a little smarter.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:04.540
A lot of the Newtonian programs had now been
automated.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.240
It was still pretty much a flat plate kind
of a program, though, were you divided the

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.070
vehicle up into a number of flat plates.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.990
And then there was some contractor in-house
wind tunnel test.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:21.990
NASA did some limited tests on potential problem
areas post phase B and pre phase C and D.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.950
That was a gap between the time we put out
an RFP, request for proposal, and the time

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.369
that the contractors came back with a proposal.

00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:36.589
We had narrowed it down that it would be a
stage and a half.

00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:40.010
That would be what we would write the RFP
for.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:47.010
We developed a large wind tunnel test program,
developed a full aerodynamic database and

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:55.260
heating database for that shuttle that was
there at that time that was delivered to the

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.329
contractors that were going to bid on that.

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:00.430
Integrated Vehicle.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:06.220
We used the USF stability and control datcom.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:12.619
Some contractor wind tunnel tests were done
and limited NASA testing and analysis for

00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:15.000
potential problem areas.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And also we did a post phase B, full aerodynamic
database for that vehicle.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:29.630
Now, with that, what we're trying to do is
eliminate configuration changes if at all

00:40:30.569 --> 00:40:31.550
possible.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:37.890
And we accomplished that to some degree, but
the change to the tank and other changes came

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.260
back in that caused us some delay.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.710
But it was minimized.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.180
Phase C and D, configuration was baseline.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.990
A big word here, make work changes only.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:56.640
Nothing has changed because it looks better,
works better.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.599
You've got to change it or it will crash.

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:00.500
That's what we said.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.339
That's not what we did.

00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:05.060
We made some changes because they were nice.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:11.050
Theoretical aerodynamic techniques were employed
to ensure you never get to test the right

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:11.730
Reynolds number.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.700
Henceforth, your boundary layer is a little
bit wrong.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.640
Plume effects, they've got to be corrected.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.430
So there was a lot of analytical work that
was done during that phase C and D.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.280
Let me say this.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:32.280
That area of our technology was really improved.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:41.700
A lot of dollars that went into that, Aaron's
courtesy, that the program probably didn't

00:41:43.369 --> 00:41:45.359
need to fly the shuttle.

00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:48.069
Now I tell him.

00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:50.680
I didn't tell him back then, you're right.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.430
[LAUGHTER] But, for the benefit of technology,
we did that.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:42:00.430
We pumped great money into CFD, great money
into method of characteristics.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:07.430
A lot of money into other techniques that
were there.

00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:13.710
And once more NASA goal was not only to do
that mission but to help technology.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:18.119
And the reason you can do CFD today was because
the dollars that the shuttle program pumped

00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:18.660
into that.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.490
Had they not pumped that in you would still
be adding up flat plates.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:29.020
[LAUGHTER] Aerodynamic variations and uncertainty
were developed for all aerodynamic coefficients.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.500
No other vehicle had really done that.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.650
You sort of did the best that you could and
said these are my aerodynamics.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.800
This is my normal force versus angle of attack.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:46.800
This is my side force coefficients, yawing
moment coefficients versus beta.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.839
And that said you would analyze that, give
that to the flight control system, give that

00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:57.640
to the structures people and they would put
their margins of safety in and look at it.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:04.640
We were quite concerned on this vehicle, especially
when it starts out at a 45 degree angle of

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.440
attack.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:13.109
And sometimes during the supersonic and transonic
regime it transists down to a low angle of

00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:14.240
attack.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.010
Flow is separated.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.430
Some place in there it reattaches.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.750
It cannot always make up its mind.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.329
You've got to be able to control the vehicle,
even though we weren't intentionally maneuvering

00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:25.000
at that time.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.790
And so we developed these variations.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:32.260
If you go back in the tunnel three times you
get what?

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.109
Four different answers.

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:37.970
[LAUGHTER] And they're all very, very close.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:42.930
If you change facilities you get slightly
different answers.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:47.190
We had some Reynolds level boundary layer
kinds of problems between the wind tunnel

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.960
and the full scale.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:55.349
And so these uncertainties were developed
for all the aerodynamic coefficients.

00:43:55.349 --> 00:44:02.130
Then this data was delivered to the GN&C people
where they make for sure that they can fly

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.890
their system with the uncertainties.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:10.890
The CN betas, yawing moment coefficient with
angle of side slip, the control moment coefficients,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:17.560
the delta yawing moments and rolling moments
due to elevon maneuvers, where the errors

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:24.560
on those, that the control system wouldn't
go berserk with any combination of those.

00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:28.520
The same with structures and with flight dynamics.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.069
Now, we're not living with those today.

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:36.740
We did flight tests to reduce the variations.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:43.740
The astronauts put in PTI, pilot test inputs,
where they would do it a certain way and we

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.849
would pre-predict those characteristics.

00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:48.730
Then we'd look at them post-flight.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:55.730
We would pull the aerodynamic characteristics
out with regression analysis techniques to

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:04.030
say this is the aerodynamic coefficients that
had to be there for that maneuver to look

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.800
like it looked.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.150
That, within itself, has some plus or minus
stuff because you can change stuff a little

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.319
bit and it still looks pretty good.

00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:16.160
Those two then were combined and we had a
set of reduced aerodynamics.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.069
But today when you go to the aerodynamic data
book, which we hope to be able to get you

00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:25.650
copies of, it will have not only the coefficients
for all mach numbers, angles of attack, angle

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:30.180
to slide slip, it will tell you what the uncertainty
as a function of mach number angle of attack

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.560
is for that.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.180
And your system should be able to work with
all those.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:39.869
I want to mention this aerodynamic design
substantiation report.

00:45:39.869 --> 00:45:45.630
You won't be able to get a copy of that any
place that I know of but we're going to try

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:50.319
to get a copy to Jeff for you, and it should
be available in your files.

00:45:50.319 --> 00:45:56.089
But what that did, that goes back in, and
for every coefficient, every angle of attack,

00:45:56.089 --> 00:46:01.140
how we arrived at that specific value and
those specific variations using both wind

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.560
tunnel and flight test.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.480
A super document.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.339
Not pretty but an excellent technical document.

00:46:09.339 --> 00:46:15.480
And that was done during the flight test program
and afterwards.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.849
I thought we would stick up there the Wind
Tunnel Testing Program.

00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:24.589
That's primarily the backbone of the aerodynamic
database of the shuttle both for the Orbiter

00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:27.640
and the Integrated Vehicle.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.339
149 entry tests on the entry vehicle.

00:46:31.339 --> 00:46:32.359
79 heating.

00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:33.380
40 structural.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.930
You can add them up.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.540
Hours of wind tunnel test time 17,000.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.890
Aaron asked me how that compared with the
Apollo.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:48.730
As best I remember, we did about 4,000 to
5,000 hours on the entry vehicle on Apollo.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:53.430
However, Apollo didn't have all of those moveable
surfaces.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:59.020
Moveable surfaces are nice, do a lot of things
for you, but you've got to test and make sure

00:46:59.020 --> 00:46:59.520
they're there.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.560
And those were through various wind tunnels
throughout the country?

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:02.810
Yes, sir.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.589
These were the best facilities in the country.

00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:07.280
Do they still exist?

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.300
Far up and away, yes, sir, they still exist.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.210
The ones at Ames are still usable.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.869
The ones at AEDC are still usable.

00:47:14.869 --> 00:47:21.040
Unfortunately, those at Langley, even though
they're there and they work, because of funding

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.770
constraints, Langley has a hard time bringing
them up and using them.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.829
And that's unfortunate because they have some
excellent facilities there.

00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:32.400
And we surely used them.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.520
In this Wind Tunnel Test Program, you can
find out in a special wind tunnel testing

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.800
program summary.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:44.220
By the way, you can get this document pretty
straightforwardly.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.480
Ascent vehicle.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:55.369
A few less hours, and that's because you don't
move as many surfaces primarily.

00:47:55.369 --> 00:47:57.530
Heating.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.180
That's something to work on.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:07.180
If you want a good project to work on, how
do you take heating data in a wind tunnel

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:16.500
on a small scale vehicle and make full scale
predictions?

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:21.579
The reason that's near and dear to my heart,
they ran a test not too long ago and they

00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:23.430
still cannot match those two.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.630
A good PhD thesis.

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.930
Maybe you can figure out how to do that and
how to do it right.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.460
A lot of scaling parameters that are used,
kind of like plumes.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:37.490
You're not sure which scaling parameter really
works, but there is slide test data, calorimeters,

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:43.750
and there is fly test data and wind tunnel
data.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:49.740
It doesn't bother us that much because we've
got enough conservatism in the system and

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:55.180
uncertainties that we know we're safe to fly,
but it does hurt your pride when you said

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:02.180
hey, that heating rate should be 9 BTU's per
foot squared per second and the fly test data

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:06.349
said it's not but 2.

00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:11.410
You might look good one way, you look bad
another way, but if I was looking for something

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:17.950
to get my plow into and I was interested in
theoretical stuff, that's probably what I'd

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:18.730
pick.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:25.730
Total Wind Tunnel Test Program, Aaron paid
for that out of his budget, by the way.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:29.190
It was less than $100 million.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.589
[LAUGHTER] In those year dollars.

00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:35.619
But it was an excellent program.

00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:42.619
Every test that was conducted was documented,
analyzed, and we can make that available.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:49.490
That concludes the things that I had to tell
you.

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.869
And we hit that hour, just about right.

00:49:52.869 --> 00:49:56.829
Do you have any questions that you'd like
to ask?

00:49:56.829 --> 00:50:03.490
If not, I'll give you a test.

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:06.869
Yes, sir.

00:50:06.869 --> 00:50:13.869
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] How do we affect the
trim?

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:24.390
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] Hypersonics, and when
I say hypersonic, let me take it down to mach

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:44.390
5, was probably the best at prediction that
we had.

00:50:45.619 --> 00:50:52.619
A flat plate which the belly of the orbiter
has a little bit of surface bending both in

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:58.700
the pitch plane and in the yaw plane for stability.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:05.460
If you put a big sphere or segment of a sphere,
you could place the Orbiter on that and you'd

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:05.880
say, hey.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:10.020
And I know a sphere or segment of a sphere
has stability.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:17.020
Now, the uncertainties turn out not to be
in normal forces or in even side forces.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:25.329
Pitching moment is the one that you tend to
miss the most.

00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:29.359
And sometimes you don't know if you have a
wrong pitching moment or a wrong center of

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:30.309
gravity.

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:35.290
They both precipitate a delta pitching moment
coefficient change.

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:41.950
The big barn doors, we have that into the
system where we control not only a rate control

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:45.210
system but an attitude control system.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:52.210
And so it takes, with a 70 square foot, it
just takes a small amount of change to correct

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:57.180
any error that you might have in either CGR
pitching moment.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:03.170
Your control mechanism is with the big elevators
and also the body flap a little bit, if you

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.319
want to use that.

00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:07.930
The reaction control system is a rate system.

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:09.300
And I didn't mention that.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:16.300
And we intentionally put the reaction control
system in the wake of the vehicle, even though,

00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:21.410
for orbital maneuvering, we have jets that
are the forward firing end.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:27.280
But so much uncertainty in how that changes
the aerodynamics in a surface that is not

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.319
a hard surface.

00:52:28.319 --> 00:52:35.030
And that interaction, you can change things
in such a way that you amplify it or reduce

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.420
it.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.930
And so we elected not to try to grapple with
that problem and use just the aft jets, but

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.829
it's just for a rate control system.

00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:48.829
End pitch, that's the distance that separated
that, and yaw on both sides, and in roll.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:58.980
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] X-15 was a low angle
of attack airplane type configuration from

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:08.880
mach 25 to mach 5.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:14.470
You're flying a spacecraft kind of configuration
where you basically roll about the velocity

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.500
vector.

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:22.630
You want to maintain that pitch trim and roll
about the velocity vector for cross-range

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:23.940
in either direction.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:29.079
Now, when you begin transition because you've
got to be down here when you're landing, you

00:53:29.079 --> 00:53:31.250
pick the best place to do that.

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:38.250
And the best place to do that is back in the
mach below 5 and, of course, above the subsonic

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.579
regime.

00:53:39.579 --> 00:53:45.180
And we try not to have any maneuvers that
are required during that time period.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:50.900
Any time you're going from a totally separated
flow on the back of the vehicle to one that

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:56.480
is now attached, separated flow cannot make
its mind sometimes.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.630
Does it want to be separated?

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.130
Does it want to be attached?

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:03.730
Not only the whole vehicle but even on small
pieces of the vehicle.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.750
And so there are uncertainties that come in
there.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:11.069
But that's the area.

00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.849
But you've got to be sure.

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:16.490
And that's where we did a lot of our PTIs,
by the way, as we became more and more brave

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:17.849
to get those coefficients.

00:54:17.849 --> 00:54:24.380
And the wind tunnel did a pretty good job
on them.

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.069
Yes.

00:54:29.069 --> 00:54:36.069
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] What you're doing
is changing the Newtonian flow now on my flat

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.200
plate 70 square foot per surface.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.569
You mean the rear-end?

00:54:46.569 --> 00:54:49.309
The rear-end, the big end, yeah.

00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:53.589
Now I've got a normal force coefficient sine
squared to the angle.

00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:59.329
Then I just change the angle up and reduce
the forces on that, and that gives me a nose

00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.579
up.

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.319
I bring it down.

00:55:00.319 --> 00:55:02.049
That gives me a nose down.

00:55:02.049 --> 00:55:02.890
It works beautifully.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.079
This is the body flap we're talking about.

00:55:05.079 --> 00:55:09.680
Body flap and elevators, yeah, both.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.260
Body flap and aft control surfaces.

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:11.559
Yes, sir.

00:55:11.559 --> 00:55:14.970
You talked about the flight test portion of
the aerodynamics.

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:18.940
What sort of planes were you using to do that?

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.960
The flight test was the shuttle itself.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:28.740
After we safely entered and everything then
we designed these pilot test inputs to extract

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.270
aerodynamic characteristics.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:34.240
The same technique that Edwards developed.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.059
And they did develop that, by the way, on
the X-15 and on other vehicles, too.

00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:40.480
And we used that same technique.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:47.079
We sent one of our men out and he spent about
almost a half a year learning all their techniques,

00:55:47.079 --> 00:55:52.869
brought that back, developed that and worked
with the astronauts very, very closely.

00:55:52.869 --> 00:55:54.950
They trained for those maneuvers.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.280
We extracted data for those maneuvers.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:03.839
We would change the aerodynamic characteristics
and not tell them what they are in the simulators.

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:07.900
And made sure that we didn't get any difficulty
and made sure that the aero people could extract

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.710
that data right and tell us how we changed
it.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.240
They all got good As.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.359
And it worked very, very well.

00:56:14.359 --> 00:56:18.670
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] No, sir.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:21.230
We did that one.

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:23.410
That was for the approach and landing test.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:25.730
But for the entry vehicle, no, those were
supersonic.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.000
Yes, and we did hypersonic.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.599
We're talking about tests that were done during
the flights.

00:56:30.599 --> 00:56:34.700
The first four flights were designated orbital
flight tests.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:39.520
And I think the PTIs actually continued well
after that.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.020
Yes.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:47.020
Actually, what this has given us, in terms
of a hypersonic database for a winged vehicle,

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:54.170
is incredible.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:59.410
At first they were called pilot test inputs
because the pilots were doing them automatically.

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:03.609
And then I remember some of the pilots were
saying you've got to do it very precisely

00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:08.410
and so we really have got to be concentrating
on that.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:13.980
And there are so many other things we have
to concentrate on.

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:16.109
Could we possibly computerize this?

00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:22.490
And so I don't remember which flight they
started doing that, but at that point the

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:28.819
PTIs became known as the program test inputs
rather than the pilot test inputs.

00:57:28.819 --> 00:57:34.510
You basically put in a little pitch up, pitch
down and see how it affected the roll and

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:38.730
the yaw and all these cross-coupling things
at lots of different mach numbers.

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:45.730
And, over the course of a bunch of different
flights and a lot of different PTIs, it really

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:52.920
built up the aerodynamic coefficients at all
these different mach numbers.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:58:00.510
You might say a little bit about how we collected
hypersonic test data in wind tunnels.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:06.460
I mean it's not like you can just have a fan
going and produce a mach 20 airflow for 20

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.589
minutes and you can play with your little
thing.

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:15.309
Hypersonic testing was done primarily at the
Ames Research Center three and a half foot

00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:17.770
facility.

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:23.500
We also did some up at Calspan, also used
some of the Langley facilities, but the real

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:27.000
workhorse was this three and a half foot hypersonic
tunnel.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.359
And basically you would have the air coming
through the tunnel at the required conditions.

00:58:32.359 --> 00:58:39.359
You would put the model of the vehicle, which
is usually a 1.5% to 3% model in the facility.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:44.799
You have what is called a six component balance
that fits into the model.

00:58:44.799 --> 00:58:47.200
That is a strain gauge relationship.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:54.200
It gives you force and moments in both directions,
or forces in both directions and some difference

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:59.299
between the gauges so you can pull the pitching
moments and the yawing moments and the rolling

00:58:59.299 --> 00:59:01.369
moments out of that.

00:59:01.369 --> 00:59:08.020
You reduce it based primarily upon dynamic
pressure or you say CN is equal to the normal

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:13.130
force divided by QS, the dynamic pressure
times a reference area.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:19.940
Standard aerodynamics, but once more a language
kind of thing where if you're in gas dynamics

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:24.480
and not aerodynamics sometimes you don't get
back over to those coefficients.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.079
By the way, in that same document all of those
terms are defined pretty well.

00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:31.700
But you measure those with a balance.

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:37.240
Then the question happens, well, I wasn't
at full scale Reynolds number.

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.660
And then that's where you come up with your
theoretical techniques.

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:44.430
And you come back in and you look at it and
you see that the boundary layer and the Reynolds

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:49.400
number corrections theoretically make a very
little bit of difference.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.440
And then you go through today the CFD programs.

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.410
You say it gets about the same answer.

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:59.329
You go back to the flight test data and it
gets about the same answer.

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:04.339
Basically, what you conclude is wind tunnels
do a super job hypersonically for this kind

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:07.400
of a configuration.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:13.510
Now, it did good on the Apollo, it did good
on the Gemini, it did good on the Mercury

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:18.730
and it did good on the Shuttle.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:22.180
Give me that configuration and I'll tell you
what the hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:22.500
are.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.520
I can tell you in phase A, and it's not going
to be too much different at the end of phase

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.190
B.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.160
And maybe you don't want to hear that because
maybe you were going to do great things in

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.230
the hypersonic area.

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:37.799
But on a blunt body, which is what we're talking
about, it does a super job now.

01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:44.799
X-15, low angles of attack flying like an
airplane, a different story completely.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:47.260
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] configuration.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:52.119
No, I wouldn't want to use just Newtonian
to predict the aerodynamic characteristics

01:00:52.119 --> 01:00:53.579
hypersonically of that vehicle.

01:00:53.579 --> 01:00:55.920
On the other hand, I wouldn't want to fly
it there either.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.280
It would burn up.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.549
Blunt body is good.

01:00:59.549 --> 01:01:02.240
98% of the energy goes into the shockwave.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:08.660
98% of the energy goes into your vehicle when
you're flying low.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.799
A manned entry vehicle enters the earth's
atmosphere.

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:19.799
You're going to be flying something like a
segment of a sphere or at worst a right elliptical

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:25.859
cone.

01:01:25.859 --> 01:01:29.680
And Newtonian works good on that one, too,
by the way.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.980
We wind tunnel tested those for different
configurations.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.930
That gets your L/D on up to a 1.75 rather
than 1.5.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:36.710
Yes, sir.

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:43.710
Why couldn't any sort of straight winged configuration
make the cross-range requirement?

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:52.890
The cross-range requirement is primarily angle
of attack oriented.

01:01:53.069 --> 01:02:00.069
The relationship between the CG payload in
and payload out is a pretty good change.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:12.480
And, if you had a straight wing, your straight
wing cannot be placed in such a way that it

01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:16.130
trims subsonically and trims hypersonically.

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:21.809
Now, it can,at higher angles of attack with
less L/D, you can make it work.

01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:28.069
But down at 45 degrees you end up with a delta
wing configuration.

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:30.569
Does that answer your question?

01:02:30.569 --> 01:02:32.240
And that's a good exercise, though.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.809
But you can go through it on a couple of sheets
of paper and say ah-ha.

01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:45.740
Because hypersonically you've got that CG,
you've got your CP, you know where it has

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:50.630
got to be placed, you get down to low angles
of attack, you know where your CP is for that

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:56.339
body, you know your CP is up at the quarter
card and you know you've got 4.5 CGs.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:58.910
It doesn't quite work.

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:00.359
It takes a delta to do that.

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:04.788
So it was more CG related than heating?

01:03:04.788 --> 01:03:06.190
Yes, sir.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:10.500
Although, the one that we mentioned, the 200
nautical mile cross-range with a straight

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.799
wing, Langley did some tests on that, even
at high angle of attack.

01:03:15.799 --> 01:03:22.799
And right in where that straight wing ties
back into the fuselage had super high heating

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:25.210
rates.

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:31.319
But we could put little fillets in there and
overcome that heating particular thing.

01:03:31.319 --> 01:03:36.579
But, if you're going to go real fast, delta
wings look better.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:37.319
[LAUGHTER] All right.

01:03:37.319 --> 01:03:37.809
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:44.809
When you were doing all this aerodynamic analysis,
did you consider a perfect surface, or did

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:53.220
you also do tests or analysis on what if the
TPS fails?

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.680
Good question.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.690
First of all, we have an external insulator.

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:06.930
And Bob Ried will talk to you about that,
and Tom Moser probably has too.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:13.930
Which meant that our main aluminum surface,
which we want to keep quite cool, is different

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:20.579
than the one that we initially designed.

01:04:20.579 --> 01:04:26.329
We went back in, made models that simulated
those differences, made calculations that

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.079
simulated those differences.

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:31.710
They were very small corrections that needed
to be made.

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:35.779
Then the other question that you had was suppose
you lose a piece of TPS?

01:04:35.779 --> 01:04:36.990
Which we did.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:42.450
We've lost some chunks of TPS early in the
program.

01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:47.160
And you cannot do much testing on that because
it's so little bitty and it's like a greased

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.630
pencil kind of a thing.

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:52.049
But you go back in.

01:04:52.049 --> 01:04:57.430
The first approach is we take some maximum
things.

01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:03.730
The pressure cannot be greater than total
and it cannot be less than zero.

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:09.400
And so let's put those deltas into that area
and into a nice area around there and see

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.069
if it makes any difference to the aerodynamic
coefficients.

01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:15.450
And they're quite small and so we feel quite
comfortable with that.

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.210
Now, from a heating, a different answer.

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:21.630
But, from an aerodynamic standpoint, does
it affect the aerodynamics?

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.230
We scope it in that way.

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:27.200
It's a pretty small area.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.788
Yes, sir.

01:05:28.788 --> 01:05:35.299
Where was the greatest risk on the aerodynamic
design?

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:40.260
During the first flight, was there anything
you were particularly concerned about?

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:40.740
Oh, yeah.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.049
[LAUGHTER] Getting it right.

01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:47.069
I guess my biggest pucker factor is in the
transitional phase.

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:54.069
I'd just seen so many things go wrong transonically
that transonic wind tunnels miss.

01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:59.569
It's a dynamic situation where you're moving.

01:05:59.569 --> 01:06:04.950
And that was, personally, my greatest concern,
did we get that right?

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:06.010
We did everything we could.

01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:10.450
And it turned out that we did a good job,
but I worried about that more than anything

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:11.359
else.

01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:17.130
Launch vehicle.

01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:24.130
Primarily did we get the structural loads
right and did we put enough margin in?

01:06:24.839 --> 01:06:30.430
We did not use uncertainties in the pressure
distributions.

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:34.170
Couldn't really figure out how to do that.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.119
We had to have balance loads.

01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:41.210
And if you said my CP can be higher or lower,
do you put it higher over the whole vehicle

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.329
or higher here and lower there?

01:06:43.329 --> 01:06:46.170
And then you've got unbalanced loads.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:52.200
But we did measure the wing bending moments,
wing shears, wing torsion and also the attached

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.760
loads in those.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.900
And so we put some uncertainties on those.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.630
And Tom has already been here.

01:06:57.630 --> 01:07:00.079
I don't know if he mentioned how they tried
to handle those.

01:07:00.079 --> 01:07:04.819
But at least they had some of those things.

01:07:04.819 --> 01:07:09.869
But we never figured out how to put uncertainties
and pressure distributions and still be able

01:07:09.869 --> 01:07:12.490
to get all the balance loads for NASTRAN.

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:16.890
Maybe one of you all are sharp enough to figure
out how to do something like that.

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:23.650
But that was the one on the ascent, had we
adequately covered the uncertainties in pressure

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:30.650
distributions with the way that we accomplished
that by the uncertainties in the bending moments,

01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:34.109
torsion and shear?

01:07:34.109 --> 01:07:41.109
Let's take a couple minute break and then
we can resume with questions.

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:52.788
I am going to go down to my office and get
one or two things which I think will be interesting

01:07:52.788 --> 01:07:53.038
that we can also talk about.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.549
Take a minute or two.

01:07:53.549 --> 01:08:00.279
Instead of one configuration, you've got one
configuration times 5 degrees, 10 degrees,

01:08:00.279 --> 01:08:01.960
minus 5 degrees.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.309
These split down the middle.

01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:05.670
The same way here, body flap.

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:09.549
You've got one, two, three, four, five times
five.

01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:15.020
You've got 25 different configurations versus
one.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.520
And so it means more testing, but you're using
the same facility.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.920
It just means more hours of wind tunnel time,
more hours of plotting and looking.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.990
Say a few words about how you did the systems
engineering or the systems integration between

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:32.990
the aerodynamics and the flight control system
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.279
All right.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.390
Let's take flight control system.

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:46.390
We, in our division, were responsible for
aerodynamics and flight dynamics.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.940
And flight dynamics wasn't very well defined.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:58.940
The Avionics Division was responsible for
the GN&C system control system and also flight

01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:01.068
dynamics.

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:05.679
So, you've got to work together.

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:08.198
And you're going to get in one another's bailiwick.

01:09:08.198 --> 01:09:09.899
That's part of good systems engineering.

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:15.009
You're going to do what the other fellow is
going to redo, and he's going to do what you're

01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:16.250
going to redo.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.850
But our responsibility was two-fold.

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:22.210
One is we had to have the right aerodynamic
characteristics.

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:27.238
But, before we had the right aerodynamic characteristics,
we had to have a configuration that should

01:09:27.238 --> 01:09:30.488
be able to live with a GN&C system.

01:09:30.488 --> 01:09:35.710
The way we accomplished that is Ken Cox, is
Ken going to be here with you?

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:36.399
No, OK.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:41.448
Ken Cox was head of the Avionics and GN&C
System.

01:09:41.448 --> 01:09:44.738
He gave us a functional GN&C system.

01:09:44.738 --> 01:09:50.649
It didn't have all the strings in it, didn't
have all of the relays and all the stuff there,

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:57.650
but if we gave it a command to change that
we knew how much it would change and how long

01:09:58.309 --> 01:09:59.540
it would take it to change.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.850
An elevator position as a for instance.

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:04.670
And so that was called a functional GN&C system.

01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:09.969
It did the right functions but it didn't do
it the same method that the real GN&C system

01:10:09.969 --> 01:10:10.820
did.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:15.080
We would take our aerodynamics and see that
it would work.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.000
And we would be able to make the maneuvers
that were required.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.909
And we would analyze it.

01:10:18.909 --> 01:10:23.309
Ad we would be pretty satisfied that with
those aerodynamics and with the variations

01:10:23.309 --> 01:10:25.659
that we were OK.

01:10:25.659 --> 01:10:27.540
But that didn't say the system was OK.

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:30.330
That just said that we had a pretty high probability
of making it work.

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:33.190
Then we sent that aerodynamic database.

01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:39.400
And all this is happening not ship it, throw
it over the fence, but over a period of time

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.270
we sent them the aerodynamic characteristics
with the variations.

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:48.210
And then they beat it bloody flying everything
they can think of with their GN&C system.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.110
Fortunately, that worked out pretty well.

01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:52.739
He would pick up a few things, but not anything
major.

01:10:52.739 --> 01:10:59.480
And, by the way, this is the only vehicle
I know that happened that way on the Orbiter.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:06.480
We didn't have any major configuration changes
that we had to make once we got well into

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:07.820
the program.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.179
It stayed the same.

01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:12.480
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] That's right, yes.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.679
And that was true.

01:11:14.679 --> 01:11:19.670
That whole thing, not only the GN&C system
but the hydraulics is when you give it the

01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:25.550
command, when you say I want a delta theta
so much or delta E of so much, that it takes

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:27.739
it about a quarter of a second to get there.

01:11:27.739 --> 01:11:34.550
And that's a long time on a lag time when
you pile all those things end to end up.

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:37.670
Now, structure is much the same way.

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:42.650
They gave us load indicators where they said
we can take so much wing shear, so much wing

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:48.100
torsion, so much wing bending, so much punch
loads into the tank from the attach point

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:54.969
in the front, so much punch loads into the
tank on the backend, SRB and we have all the

01:11:54.969 --> 01:11:55.219
gimbling.

01:11:55.219 --> 01:11:58.330
That's where we're doing the flight performance
calculations, through the wind shears and

01:11:58.330 --> 01:11:59.840
the wind gust.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:04.090
And we assure ourselves that we don't violate
any of the load indicators.

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:06.750
But that does not say the vehicle is safe.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:10.540
Then GN&C flies that one through that and
gives all those conditions back over to the

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.059
structures people, and they analyze the hound
out of it.

01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:18.830
They look at all the cracks and crevices.

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:25.830
And, if you have people that don't have a
cooperative spirit, it will not work.

01:12:26.469 --> 01:12:27.699
It just doesn't work.

01:12:27.699 --> 01:12:34.059
So, you've got to learn how to get along with
your buddies over on the other side.

01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:38.230
Don't build your fiefdom up that your wall
is so big and you control your own destiny

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.320
because you don't.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.080
And we had a super group of people to work
with.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.040
And, to me, that's what really made it work.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.150
The same thing on heating, by the way.

01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:52.980
They would give us heating indicators and
we would fly it because that was a little

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.050
more straightforward where they would give
us the Q dot locals to Q dot references.

01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:59.030
And we would look through all the Q dot references.

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:03.809
And we'd give them all the final set of trajectories
and they would analyze it in detail.

01:13:03.809 --> 01:13:10.809
But I look at it as here is a problem and
I can work it like a piece of pie and go on

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.300
this problem, go all the way down to the center,
then go over and eat this piece and this piece.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.870
It doesn't work that way.

01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:22.659
You start around the edges and you cycle in
on it.

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:29.659
You eat all the pie, but you accomplished
it around the edges first and work out your

01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:31.570
bigger problems and then get down to the smaller
problems.

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:31.820
Bass, I think the important point, too, is
that no matter what system you work on, whether

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:32.000
you work on the Apollo or you work on the
Shuttle or whether you work on the new CEV,

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.510
you're going to basically have to go through
the same process.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.280
It may be simpler or harder but you're going
to have to go through the same process.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:36.530
Absolutely.

01:13:36.449 --> 01:13:36.770
Yes, sir.

01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:43.770
You said there was no major configuration
changes like around the program, but is there

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:51.840
anything that you felt you were kind of stuck
with like I wish we could have changed this?

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.000
Like not having the OMS pods stick out in
the back like that?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
What that a problem for aerodynamics?

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.170
No.

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:12.820
We lost the increased drag a little bit, but
not enough to hurt anything.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:19.820
And aerodynamics, it didn't bother me any
that my L/D went down by 0.001.

01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:28.159
But now the fellows that were flying it, they
got in there, they said I can still go around

01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:31.670
the hack and I can still do all the things
I want to.

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:34.010
But all that was done.

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:37.510
And once more, systems integration, you've
got to include the crew.

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:43.309
GN&C system, it doesn't bother them in aero,
it doesn't bother them in structures, but

01:14:43.309 --> 01:14:45.030
you've still got to fly.

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:52.030
And Dr.Gilvarry said you don't want the pilots
talking bad about your airplanes in the bars

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:57.550
so keep your crew happy.

01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:04.120
[LAUGHTER] But, to answer your question, no,
not really.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.880
To meet the requirements, it's going to look
pretty much the same.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.440
If I designed it today, OK, let's go back,
the same requirements now.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.860
If you give me a different set of requirements,
it's not going to look the same.

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:23.170
Bass, some people wanted to put some canards
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:26.199
canards, that's not a joke.

01:15:26.199 --> 01:15:29.980
That was done, but it was a big argument.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:34.980
A canard is an aerodynamic surface part of
the center of gravity.

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.670
And the beneficial part, let me tell you the
good parts about canards.

01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:45.670
canards, subsonically, I can give a pitch
up moment and increase my lift.

01:15:46.559 --> 01:15:52.610
If it's on the aft of the vehicle when I give
a pitch up moment, I decrease my lift.

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:54.909
So, canards are wonderful.

01:15:54.909 --> 01:16:01.909
But what canards do is it fouls up the flow
over all of the rest of your vehicle.

01:16:04.699 --> 01:16:10.150
And so, back to here, I've got one configuration.

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:11.830
Unsteady aerodynamics.

01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:12.500
Heating.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.840
Fixed configuration.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.900
I put a canard out there.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:21.520
Now I've got two more configurations, three
more configurations, four more, five more,

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.040
six more.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.790
And it does a lot of grief with vortexes and
stuff like that.

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:32.400
Now, if you had to have it, you have to have
it.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.780
Concorde had to have it, but that didn't mean
that Shuttle had to have it.

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.420
It operated fine without canards.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:42.449
I sure wouldn't put canards on there, if we
had another shot at it.

01:16:42.449 --> 01:16:44.320
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:51.320
Would it be easier, faster or cheaper to design
the Shuttle, the Orbiter [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:03.989
You ask good questions, young lady.

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:07.920
[LAUGHTER] Yes and no.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:14.920
With the tools we have and the foreknowledge
that we have, having been there before, absolutely

01:17:14.969 --> 01:17:15.280
yes.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:22.280
And I don't want to be negative, but you don't
have the cooperative spirit going on that

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.100
you had then.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.510
I don't know why either.

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:35.460
The young engineers are sharper, no ifs, and
or buts.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:42.460
You all know a whole lot more than I ever
knew, but you don't get along as well.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.690
[LAUGHTER] This is mine.

01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:51.900
I don't need you here.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.400
I don't want you here.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.110
Get out of here.

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:55.540
I'm going to do it my way.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:57.340
And that's just an observation I made.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.290
It might be that my knothole is too restricted.

01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:04.260
But it goes up to pretty high management,
too.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.170
Not just at the working level.

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:11.760
A second thing is they asked me to come in
and consult with them.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.320
And they had lost technical capability.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.230
Didn't use any engineers much after a certain
time on the Shuttle.

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:23.460
And then, after the last accident, they had
to bring the engineers in.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:30.460
And they said I've never looked at that and
I'm on the payroll.

01:18:30.469 --> 01:18:37.469
The capability was greatly lacking, and so
we developed some ways to bring them to speed

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.320
in about a year and a half period of time
which happened.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:43.920
Observation.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:50.920
By the way, I was pleased that you all got
to class on time.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.360
I told management to send them to ethics school.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.550
Now, if there is a meeting and you tell somebody
you will be there at that time, you be there

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:00.670
at that time.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:06.010
If you tell somebody you will make a deliverable
at that time, you make a deliverable at that

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:06.570
time.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:10.540
Be a man or woman of your word.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.620
And I found that lacking.

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.949
I don't know that ethics school helped too
much that we sent them all to.

01:19:15.949 --> 01:19:22.370
Well, it did, too, because the second day
of class there were, I think, ten of them

01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.900
late.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.489
And he sent them back and wouldn't let them
in the class.

01:19:26.489 --> 01:19:32.820
[LAUGHTER] But learn to get along with folks.

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:33.580
They are your friends.

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:34.159
They're your buddies.

01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:36.150
They are going to be there for a lifetime.

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:38.040
And, yeah, you're going to have some grief.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.150
And, yeah, he will give you some headaches
or she will give you some headaches.

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:46.210
But you're all on the same team, and work
hard towards that.

01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:50.659
I know you've got to grit your teeth and spit
sometimes, but that's major.

01:19:50.659 --> 01:19:57.659
And that didn't cost you anything.

01:19:57.790 --> 01:20:00.520
About the wind tunnel testing, firstly, could
you have reduced that now with CFD?

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.489
And, secondly, you showed there were several
hundred tests.

01:20:02.489 --> 01:20:02.739
Yes.

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.239
And several tens of thousands of hours.

01:20:04.239 --> 01:20:04.489
Yes.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:11.460
Does that mean each test ran for several hundred
hours?

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.300
Some tests ran for hundreds of hours.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:18.900
That was the total number of hours for all
those tests, not a per hour basis.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.330
But, yeah, there were some hundred hour tests
that went on.

01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:26.340
To answer your question, does CFD reduce the
number of wind tunnel hours?

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:31.630
Three areas that we're working in right now.

01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:37.110
One reason is to bring the engineers up to
technical speed where they can stand up and

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.800
be counted.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.510
And you can ask them a technical question,
they can give you a technical answer and say

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:44.280
this is my analysis and this is how I got
that.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:50.300
To do that we recommended back to Johnson
Spacecraft Center that you better get your

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:54.290
engineers knowing how to do wind tunnel tests
and you've got to get them to know how to

01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:56.889
make the calculations to run these programs.

01:20:56.889 --> 01:20:58.400
You've got to be able to do all that.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.920
That's your integration contractor.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.920
They need to have that capability.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.920
And they've done that and they really came
up to speed.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.820
In the midst of that, they've also increased
their CFD capabilities.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:12.340
And I'm very envious of what you can do with
CFD.

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:17.270
However, it hasn't decreased the amount of
runs that they're requesting.

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:21.040
It's increasing the amount of runs that they're
requesting because they will do this little

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.790
bitty analysis and here is the cable tray
going down that, and they'll say does it go

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:27.309
sonic under the cable tray?

01:21:27.309 --> 01:21:28.300
Well, I don't know.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.370
What does the wind tunnel test say?

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:35.739
Well, we just have a data point here and a
data point here and our CFD shows that it

01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:40.150
can go sonic under there, we need to test
that to make sure that's there.

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:44.350
[LAUGHTER] And so it could but I don't think
it will.

01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:49.639
I think the better your tools get you want
to make sure they're right.

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:55.670
Now, one day I think yes, that's going to
happen, but right now there is still a lot

01:21:55.670 --> 01:22:00.940
of question, even in the CFD-er's mind, am
I really right?

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:06.059
And they've always been accused of they can
tell you what the right answer is if you give

01:22:06.059 --> 01:22:07.320
it to them.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.590
[LAUGHTER] And that's really not true any
longer.

01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:12.850
That was for a number of years.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:15.409
But that CFD is so great.

01:22:15.409 --> 01:22:18.550
And they used overflow, by the way, is the
one that's primary to the big workhorse right

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:20.570
now, and it does a super job.

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:23.550
Was there a question?

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:25.050
All right.

01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:25.809
Any other question?

01:22:25.809 --> 01:22:32.300
I would like to address the question that
was asked about [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:37.389
Let me not talk necessarily about the Shuttle,
but let me talk about Apollo for a moment.

01:22:37.389 --> 01:22:38.730
And I mentioned it before.

01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:44.150
In Apollo, we went to the moon with a single
string avionic system.

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:49.420
We had one IMU, one computer on the Command
and Service Module.

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:54.150
We had one service propulsion system to get
you out of lunar orbit or to get you into

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:56.190
lunar orbit.

01:22:56.190 --> 01:23:03.190
And I think today it would be very difficult
to do that.

01:23:04.239 --> 01:23:07.889
I think you're probably going to have to have
multiple strings.

01:23:07.889 --> 01:23:13.610
You're going to have an escape system.

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:16.270
I think, in that context, it may be more difficult.

01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:22.370
I do think the tools you have today will make
it easier, but I do think what we know today,

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:27.409
just like Bass said on understanding a little
bit about the aerodynamics, you want more.

01:23:27.409 --> 01:23:32.699
I think in some respects -- My comment is
that the next time we go to the moon we're

01:23:32.699 --> 01:23:37.340
going to find out how hard it really was because
I do think it's going to be hard to do.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:38.760
At least that's my personal feeling.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.380
And I think a lot of people agree with me.

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:43.909
One of the toughest decisions we ever made
in the Space Program, and Bass and I were

01:23:43.909 --> 01:23:47.989
talking about it at breakfast, is when we
decided to do Apollo 8.

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:53.469
Apollo 8 was probably the most fantastic mission
that we ever came up with.

01:23:53.469 --> 01:23:58.150
That was the first time we left the influence
of earth's gravity, we went into orbit around

01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:00.929
the moon and we got out of orbit of the moon.

01:24:00.929 --> 01:24:05.489
Now, we didn't land on the moon but did everything
we had to do for the first time.

01:24:05.489 --> 01:24:11.800
And I think that was probably the boldest
decision that NASA and the government ever

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.520
made.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.440
Again, I look back, and I'm not sure how we
would make that decision today.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.469
It was pretty tough.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:23.510
And, of course, one man led that attack, George
Low who was Manager of the Apollo Program

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:27.630
Office at Johnson Space Center, then became
Deputy Administrator and then became President

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:30.929
of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:33.980
But that was really a fantastic project.

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:40.980
I will comment on the programs that I worked
on.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:49.530
Aerodynamics on Dyna-Soar, which was a defunked
Air Force manned spacecraft program.

01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:56.530
I worked on Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Blue
Gemini.

01:24:57.159 --> 01:25:04.159
And each time I would go onto the next program
and learn more, I would say we sure were lucky.

01:25:04.159 --> 01:25:11.159
[LAUGHTER] When I was telling you about these
new young engineers now that are up to speed

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:14.400
where they didn't want to say anything.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:20.170
Now that they're crunching numbers, they got
a lot of criticism for the way we did it.

01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.920
[LAUGHTER] And rightfully so.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.420
A lot of capability that is there.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:29.460
And you're going to have more capability today
than you had yesterday, more capability on

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.489
the next program than you had on the last
program.

01:25:32.489 --> 01:25:38.460
You're going to find some things to do and
be able to do it better than the last program

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.170
was done.

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:44.620
That's both good news and bad news.

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:49.900
Bad news is it will cost you more to do it
and the good news is it will be done a whole

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.880
lot better.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.590
All right.

01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:56.440
Any other question?

01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.280
I thought it might be interesting, just to
make sure you really have an understanding

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.420
of what the Shuttle has to do, to sort of
take them through the entry.

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.739
And maybe, Bass, you'll make some comments
about the aerodynamics and I'll talk a little

01:26:09.739 --> 01:26:14.760
bit about the operations.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:21.760
You're in orbit a couple hundred miles above
the ground, and the first thing that you do

01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:29.730
is basically put the Orbiter, after you get
everything stowed and ready for entry, so

01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:33.699
you're essentially going backwards, face to
the ground.

01:26:33.699 --> 01:26:37.080
And you burn the OMS engines.

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:41.860
And just, in terms of redundancy, we've got
two engines.

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:46.690
You can cross-feed the fuel that is inside
the OMS pod.

01:26:46.690 --> 01:26:49.239
You can cross-feed from one side to the other.

01:26:49.239 --> 01:26:54.880
So, even if you lose one OMS engine, you can
still do a de-orbit burn just on the other

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.130
engine.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:27:01.960
Of course, you will have to turn a little
bit so that you can burn through the CG.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.389
If you lose both OMS engines, you can cross-feed
the propellant into the reaction control system

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:10.880
aft jets and you can come back using those.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.770
And if you're having a real bad day and you
run out, well, you know, you might have a

01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:21.000
fuel leak, for instance, and so you don't
have enough propellant back there.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.150
Actually, there was a procedure where you
then would flip over and burn the remainder

01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:31.630
of your forward RCS propellant to just slow
yourself down as much as you could.

01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:32.600
We never had to do that.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.860
In fact, I don't think we ever lost an OMS
engine.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.870
But we practice all these things.

01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:44.870
Anyway, the point is, one way or the other,
you slow yourself down.

01:27:46.889 --> 01:27:49.889
Here is the earth and here is your orbit.

01:27:49.889 --> 01:27:51.280
This is grossly out of scale.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:58.280
You realize that on this scale your orbit
is actually about like that.

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:05.550
In any case, you do your burn just enough
to lower your perigee just about two ground

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.969
level.

01:28:09.969 --> 01:28:14.440
And now you're essentially in free-fall.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.300
I mean you're in free-fall in orbit, but now
you're gradually getting closer to the earth.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:27.300
And so what you do is you now flip over and
you put yourself in a position where when

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:34.860
you actually hit the top upper reaches of
the atmosphere -- And about 400,000 feet is

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:38.750
what we call entry interface.

01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:45.750
And, actually, the flight control system changes
at that point and the computer actually goes

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.400
into a different mode.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.580
So, at this point, you're now at a 40 degree
angle.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:58.580
And, as Bass said, that gives you your blunt
surfaces approaching.

01:28:59.309 --> 01:29:05.370
And basically the sensors feel the deceleration.

01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:09.520
And that's really how you know where you are
in the entry.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.260
You sense the deceleration.

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:15.480
That tells you what the dynamic pressure is.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.840
During the early part of the entry, all of
your control is by the reaction control system

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:26.840
because you don't have enough dynamic pressure
on the aerodynamic surfaces to be effective.

01:29:27.239 --> 01:29:34.239
As you get down further and further into the
atmosphere -- Let's see.

01:29:34.639 --> 01:29:38.840
I think the number that comes to mind is ten.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:42.760
I assume that's ten pounds per square foot
dynamic pressure.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.350
Yes.

01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:46.809
Is when the ailerons become effective.

01:29:46.809 --> 01:29:51.550
And so you have what is called a blended control
system.

01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:58.150
The first thing that you can do is actually
control your roll, and so you disable the

01:29:58.150 --> 01:30:01.699
roll jets and you enable the ailerons.

01:30:01.699 --> 01:30:05.280
But the pitch and the yaw is still controlled
by the RCS.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:12.280
And the critical thing, like Bass was saying,
is you've got to keep your angle of attack

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:19.239
constant with respect to your velocity vector
because your aerodynamic heating depends on

01:30:19.239 --> 01:30:19.489
that.

01:30:19.409 --> 01:30:24.320
If you get down to too low an angle now you're
going to heat the surfaces, the upper part

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.710
of the Orbiter and you're going to burn up.

01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:32.110
You're controlling your angle around the velocity
vector.

01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:34.750
And now you can move about that.

01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:38.559
You have a lift vector.

01:30:38.559 --> 01:30:44.480
And now the whole name of the game, because,
remember, this is a glider.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.510
And so energy control is what is absolutely
essential to make sure that you're going to

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:55.630
end up at the threshold of the runway at about
-- You said we were aiming for 150 knots.

01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:57.520
We never actually made it.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.989
Actually, about 200 knots was the touchdown
speed.

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.199
But pretty good anyway.

01:31:04.199 --> 01:31:06.550
We got close.

01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:13.550
At every phase of your entry, knowing your
energy and controlling it is critical.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:20.880
For instance, for whatever reason, if your
burn didn't go right and you think you're

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:28.840
going to be short of the runway, we notched
down the angle of attack just a little bit.

01:31:29.190 --> 01:31:34.400
I think about 38 degrees was about the lowest
you could safely go.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.659
And you keep your lift vector.

01:31:36.659 --> 01:31:42.090
You basically would fly the entire entry with
your lift vector going away from the earth,

01:31:42.090 --> 01:31:44.790
and that maximizes your range.

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:49.580
But you actually target the entry so that
you have more energy than you need because

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:54.679
it's a lot easier to bleed off energy than
somehow to get it back, especially when you

01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:56.449
don't have any engines.

01:31:56.449 --> 01:32:02.179
What you normally do then is you will basically
do a roll maneuver.

01:32:02.179 --> 01:32:07.850
And you'll be rolling so that your angle of
attack, with respect to your velocity vector,

01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:09.790
is always 40 degrees.

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:13.929
But essentially you're rolling around the
velocity vector so you can now point your

01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:16.550
lift over to the side.

01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:23.550
And, for instance, if you didn't have enough
propellant when you were burning, and so now

01:32:26.199 --> 01:32:31.590
you actually have too much energy, what you're
going to do -- Or, for instance, if you have

01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:36.020
a lot of cross-range that you have to make
up, you could spend your entire entry over

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.330
on your side like this.

01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:44.330
And, in fact, there was even a case which
we would simulate if you have an under-burn,

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:50.420
now you have too much energy and you have
to get really get rid of a lot of energy,

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:53.900
you could actually roll 180 degrees.

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:55.929
And that would be pretty sporty.

01:32:55.929 --> 01:32:57.969
[LAUGHTER] Again, nobody has ever had to do
that.

01:32:57.969 --> 01:32:59.350
But we did simulate it.

01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:06.350
And I don't know what you would make of the
aerodynamics coming in, but the point is you

01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:14.639
have a basic design that you're working with
and then you try to develop operational procedures

01:33:14.639 --> 01:33:19.120
to make the system work in as many contingencies
as possible.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.639
Anyway, that's the deal.

01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:27.639
You basically are rolling around the velocity
vector to control both your energy and your

01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:31.260
cross-range.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:32.870
Let's see.

01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:39.870
Then at 20 psf the elevons actually get pitch
affectivity, and so you disable the pitch

01:33:43.969 --> 01:33:44.670
jets.

01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:50.909
And now both the pitch and the roll are controlled
by the elevons.

01:33:50.909 --> 01:33:54.179
The vertical stabilizer, as you can see, is
in the shadow.

01:33:54.179 --> 01:33:58.739
And so, actually, you don't get yaw affectivity
out of the vertical stabilizer until just

01:33:58.739 --> 01:34:05.739
about transonic and subsonic, when you actually
do the final pitch-over to get ready for going

01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:08.210
into the heading alignment circle.

01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:13.809
And that's why sometimes, if you've seen pictures
of the Shuttle as it approaches the landing

01:34:13.809 --> 01:34:16.909
at Kennedy Space Center, you will see little
plumes come out the side.

01:34:16.909 --> 01:34:22.670
And that's the yaw jets and the RCS which
are still firing, because it's still supersonic

01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:25.900
when it gets over the Space Center.

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:31.780
And, if you're on the ground, you can actually
hear this double sonic boom which is pretty

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:32.030
impressive.

01:34:31.969 --> 01:34:35.800
And I guess you get one from the front and
one from the back of the vehicle, so it's

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:42.800
a boom boom and then it goes around.

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.530
And then, of course, you hit the atmosphere
at mach 25.

01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:55.530
And so you're going through this entire aerodynamic
regime down through hypersonic, supersonic,

01:34:57.679 --> 01:35:00.550
transonic, subsonic.

01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:07.550
And I remember, Max Faget gave us a little
talk about how the aerodynamic coefficients,

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:14.820
I mean you were talking about them, but they
change at different mach numbers, right?

01:35:14.969 --> 01:35:17.580
Oh, yes.

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:22.040
And we mentioned this before, you know, why
you really need a fly-by-wire system on this

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:29.040
vehicle, because the control laws that you're
using to do a roll maneuver at mach 15 are

01:35:33.889 --> 01:35:38.639
different from doing a roll maneuver at mach
8.

01:35:38.639 --> 01:35:42.119
These program test inputs, you can hardly
see them.

01:35:42.119 --> 01:35:43.659
I mean you really didn't feel them.

01:35:43.659 --> 01:35:50.659
They were just a couple of degrees that you
would move the stick, you know, just little

01:35:51.869 --> 01:35:52.420
things.

01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:58.850
But that collected enough data to get a much
better determination of these coefficients.

01:35:58.850 --> 01:36:03.350
You're very sensitive to things like beta
angle.

01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:04.960
Probably about two degrees.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.119
If you go off more than that.

01:36:07.119 --> 01:36:14.119
Actually, when you read the detailed description
of the loss of Columbia, when they had a penetration

01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:20.690
of the forward edge of the wing, that disturbed
the airflow.

01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:27.690
And so the control system was fighting a really
valiant fight to keep Columbia on target.

01:36:32.130 --> 01:36:35.559
And they could see that on the ground.

01:36:35.559 --> 01:36:41.909
There was more aerodynamic surface activity
and the RCS jets kicked in.

01:36:41.909 --> 01:36:48.909
In the end, of course, you run out of control
authority and the vehicle eventually diverged

01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:54.119
and it actually broke up aerodynamically.

01:36:54.119 --> 01:36:56.449
It was not an explosion.

01:36:56.449 --> 01:36:59.960
It just broke up aerodynamically.

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:06.960
The hot gases in the wing were disrupting
the airflow and eventually the wing was slumping,

01:37:09.489 --> 01:37:12.380
and so things were just getting worse and
worse.

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.969
And I don't know exactly what went first.

01:37:15.969 --> 01:37:19.989
Pieces were falling off along the way.

01:37:19.989 --> 01:37:26.989
The same thing if you read the analysis of
the Challenger accident on a second-by-second

01:37:27.559 --> 01:37:34.409
basis, you'll see the main engines were adjusting
their thrust and trying to keep it -- The

01:37:34.409 --> 01:37:40.570
system was really working hard just doing
what it was supposed to do.

01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:46.679
Essentially the flight control system was
trying to keep it within the control boundaries,

01:37:46.679 --> 01:37:51.960
and eventually it ran out of muscle because
of the other failures.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:58.960
And once you go to a bad beta angle or angle
of attack the vehicle breaks up aerodynamically.

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:06.489
Bass, you might say a word about the aerodynamic
coefficients and which ones were the hardest

01:38:06.489 --> 01:38:11.219
to determine and how big [were the errors?].

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:11.809
OK.

01:38:11.809 --> 01:38:18.809
Basically, aerodynamic coefficients are normal
forces, side forces, rolling moments, yawing

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:28.300
moments, pitching moments and those that change
that like elevators, body flaps, rudders and

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.449
speed breaks.

01:38:35.449 --> 01:38:42.449
The coefficients, the biggest variations are
in the low supersonic to transonic speed regimes

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.489
primarily in the control variables.

01:38:52.489 --> 01:38:59.489
The biggest ones were just before transition
or any time that the elevators were in an

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:08.250
up position where the flow couldn't quite
decide whether to be attached or separated.

01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:11.730
And so you want to avoid that.

01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:17.090
Digging down, not very much variations in
those at all, but coming in the up position

01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:21.139
pretty big variations in the rolling moments
and yaw moments due to those.

01:39:21.139 --> 01:39:27.580
And we tried to avoid those, of course, and
henceforth with the CG location.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:34.580
But those were the ones that probably were
the toughest and we tried to stay away from.

01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:43.510
Overall, hypersonics right on, subsonics second
best, transonic the most difficult, low supersonic

01:39:49.929 --> 01:39:52.270
kind of in between there.

01:39:52.270 --> 01:39:59.270
The coefficients, it's hard to talk about
them on a percentage basis because CM is zero

01:39:59.909 --> 01:40:05.850
and the delta CM is an infinite percentage
so you cannot really talk about them on a

01:40:05.850 --> 01:40:09.369
percentage basis.

01:40:09.369 --> 01:40:16.369
But, when you look at the plots like CM versus
alpha, very small variation after we got through

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:23.719
with the flight test program.

01:40:23.719 --> 01:40:30.409
Before we got through the flight test program,
we probably cut the variations in half on

01:40:30.409 --> 01:40:35.210
things like pitching moments, yawing moments
and rolling moments.

01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:40.880
We did better than that on the pitching moments,
yawing moments and rolling moments due to

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.880
elevator positions when they were local angles
of attack.

01:40:48.199 --> 01:40:55.199
And those were cut quite significantly with
the PTIs.

01:40:55.830 --> 01:41:02.830
But still, even today, you don't just have
one coefficient at one angle of attack, one

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.300
angle of side slippage.

01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:09.159
You evaluate that one plus the variation that's
about it.

01:41:09.159 --> 01:41:16.159
And I remember one of the big activities in
the simulators before the first flight.

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.010
They would have the test flight crews, who
were going to make these flights, do flying

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.179
entries.

01:41:24.179 --> 01:41:28.699
And they would actually vary the aerodynamic
coefficients.

01:41:28.699 --> 01:41:35.340
And, if you put in a big enough variation,
three sigma and all of the parameters and

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:41.300
they went in the wrong direction, you could
always make it impossible to have a successful

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:41.639
entry.

01:41:41.639 --> 01:41:47.739
And so it was a real question where the managers,
and Aaron, maybe you have something to say

01:41:47.739 --> 01:41:53.949
about that, you and Chris Kraft had to really
make the decision when you knew enough and

01:41:53.949 --> 01:41:55.369
when you could fly safely.

01:41:55.369 --> 01:41:56.619
You're going to hear Chris Kraft talk shortly.

01:41:56.619 --> 01:42:03.619
But I remember after we landed the first mission
there were a lot of people saying that the

01:42:11.389 --> 01:42:13.030
Shuttle wasn't going to work, all the tiles
were going to come off.

01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:20.030
The flight control system was a big issue
because of the aerodynamics.

01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.280
The flight control system, the aerodynamics
wasn't going to work.
I don't know if you've ever been to the Johnson
Space Center and to the Control Room, but

01:42:24.239 --> 01:42:30.530
I was sitting at the consul with Chris Kraft
and he got on the Net and said -- Because

01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:31.940
there was a lot of criticism.

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:36.400
A lot of people wrote letters that the Shuttle
would crash and wasn't going to make it.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:41.350
And he got on the Net and said we're infinitely
smarter today.

01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:44.909
And I guess that summarized it, we were infinitely
smarter and we did design a good system.

01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:51.909
And I think that about summed it up, that
we were infinitely smarter.

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.389
Any more questions?

01:42:58.389 --> 01:42:58.699
Yeah.

01:42:58.699 --> 01:43:00.250
Actually, it's an operational question.

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:00.559
OK.

01:43:00.559 --> 01:43:05.690
I'm just wondering if the entire crew is trained
on the whole landing procedure.

01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:06.110
No.

01:43:06.110 --> 01:43:11.290
We have two pilots just like in any airplane.

01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:18.150
Some of the people who flew center seat as
flight engineers were trained pilots.

01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:21.239
And I would have been quite comfortable if
they had landed the Shuttle.

01:43:21.239 --> 01:43:27.369
But how many failures do you prepare for?

01:43:27.369 --> 01:43:32.500
We have two people onboard who are trained
to land.

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:38.940
I always thought to myself, we also have this
auto land software which nobody has ever used,

01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:45.940
but if somehow all the other six people were
incapacitated and it was just me, I would

01:43:46.290 --> 01:43:48.690
push the auto land sequence.

01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:55.690
[LAUGHTER] And all you have to do is put the
gear down manually, and I know how to do that.

01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:02.900
But landing the Shuttle is really very complicated.

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:08.230
And they train hundreds and hundreds of hours
in the simulator.

01:44:08.230 --> 01:44:15.230
Some day we could spend a whole session talking
about the Shuttle Training Aircraft.

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:23.290
It is one thing to land in the simulator,
but nobody has ever died in a simulator, number

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:23.540
one.

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:27.920
And, number two, you're looking at a TV screen.

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:29.860
You're not actually looking out at the runway.

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:32.130
You don't feel the bumpy aerodynamics.

01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:39.130
And so they developed a Shuttle Training Aircraft,
which is the Gulfstream II very heavily modified.

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:43.690
It's actually a flying simulator.

01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:50.690
Your final approach, because your L/D on this
vehicle, I don't know what it is exactly,

01:44:51.139 --> 01:44:54.190
is about five maybe.

01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:56.350
I think five at best, yeah.

01:44:56.350 --> 01:45:01.389
You're coming in at about a 20 degree approach
angle, which may not seem like a lot.

01:45:01.389 --> 01:45:08.389
But a commercial airplane comes in at about
three degrees and the problem is, you take

01:45:08.909 --> 01:45:14.650
a regular airplane, and you point it down
at a 20 degree angle,and your airspeed is

01:45:14.650 --> 01:45:16.250
going to go above your redline.

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:22.469
So you've got to make enough drag to simulate
the Shuttle.

01:45:22.469 --> 01:45:27.159
There's computers inside this Shuttle training
aircraft.

01:45:27.159 --> 01:45:33.540
The left seat is set up to be just like the
Shuttle cockpit, and when the pilot makes

01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:38.949
the maneuvers, it basically goes back into
the computers and they work the flight control

01:45:38.949 --> 01:45:43.010
system of the gulf stream, to make the gulf
stream fly like the Shuttle.

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:48.389
The only way that they can produce enough
drag to make it go at a constant speed at

01:45:48.389 --> 01:45:55.389
a 20 degree angle, is you have full speed
brakes your gear is down, you have thrust

01:45:57.330 --> 01:46:02.929
reverses you run your engines in reverse,
after your on the runway to slow youself down.

01:46:02.929 --> 01:46:07.540
On the gulf stream, they run their engines
at 90% reverse thrust while they're flying

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.139
in the air.

01:46:09.139 --> 01:46:11.400
It's an extraodinary vehicle.

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:17.440
I've flown in the center seat just to sit
in it and you may be flying on this angle

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:24.440
but it looks like your flying like this [LAUGHTER]
It's really extraodinary.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:32.600
Just one thing to remind you,a week from today
we've asked for the initial report outline

01:46:33.199 --> 01:46:35.350
plus some reference material.

01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:42.350
What we want to get a sense of what is your
plans, what's the scope of what you're going

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:49.860
to be looking at, what are you going to deal
with and I hope by this time that you've located

01:46:50.909 --> 01:46:57.690
some reference materials you're going to be
using.

01:46:57.690 --> 01:47:02.570
We'll be sort of spiralling in on this so
the idea is we'll take a look at what your

01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:09.210
plans are and then we can work together if
you have some questions or having difficulties

01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:13.510
this gives us some opportunities to talk about
it to make sure you're on the right track

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:18.929
so you'll be doing something that you can
be proud of, that you'll actually learn something

01:47:18.929 --> 01:47:23.159
from, so that's due a week from today.

01:47:23.159 --> 01:47:28.159
It would be useful for me to have those electronically
so that I can send them to Professor Cohen

01:47:28.159 --> 01:47:29.650
for him to look at.

01:47:29.650 --> 01:47:36.650
I am happy to accept hard copy as well but
I want them electronically Any questions?

01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:40.770
Have a good weekend.

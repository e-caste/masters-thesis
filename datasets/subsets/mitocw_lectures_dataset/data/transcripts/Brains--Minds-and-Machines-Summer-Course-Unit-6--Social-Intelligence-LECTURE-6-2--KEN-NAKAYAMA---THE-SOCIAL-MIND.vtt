KEN NAKAYAMA: The
social mind, let

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.933
me see if I can just go
through these slides here.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.000
One might ask the
question on the origin

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.775
of human intelligence.

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:33.900
OK, I just want to give a
little bit of background.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.360
Nancy summarized my
career very nicely.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.920
I started out recording
from retinal ganglion cells

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.930
and animals.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.770
That was a very long time ago.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.440
And I was kind of
into reductionism,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
trying to understand how retinal
ganglion cells determined

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.670
how we see certain
psychophysical phenomenon.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.047
So what am I doing
here talking about some

00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:54.130
of that social processing?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.760
Well, it's been a long
time ago, so in your career

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.210
you do different things.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.850
But as I'll say in
a moment, I happened

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.310
to read an interesting paper.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.220
I was in the University of
Tokyo library kind of bored

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.130
and I found a book.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.280
And I found an article,
which I'll talk about that.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.890
Didn't change my life,
exactly, but it reoriented me

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.280
towards this social processing.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.950
And you'll see there's many
different ways of studying.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.530
I think the realization
that social processing

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.860
and the human mind are
really very inextricably

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.880
connected opens the door
for kinds of investigations

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.310
that I think are sort of really
open-ended and somewhat limited

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.960
just by your imagination.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740
So I sort of
encourage some of you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.260
with that bent to
think about this.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.680
Since I study vision I
will just talk a little bit

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.020
about the visual
system as a preamble.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.900
And I was studying vision
about 50 years ago.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.570
And I think I was sleeping
for about 10 years.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.859
And all of a sudden I found
out something interesting.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.400
Here's a picture of
the visual system

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.460
when I started graduate school.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.900
There was the motor system,
the somatosensory system,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.280
coupled sensory system.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.980
And vision was that
area 17 V1 in the cortex

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.084
I think I slept a
little bit and all

00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:11.880
of a sudden I woke up and
oops, little bit past 1970.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.730
Almost the whole half of the
brain in the back and the front

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.500
was devoted to vision.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.520
You probably had
lectures by that.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.259
And so I think that's really an
important fact because the fact

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.550
that the brain is very visual--

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.360
I mean, that's human.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.700
So maybe in mice it
might be different,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.991
they may be it's old fashioned,
or something like that.

00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:29.880
But for primates I think
it's very important.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.010
You probably learned about
the different systems.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.551
That the posterior
part of the brain.

00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:36.030
There's a lot of anterior parts.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.470
David Marr said, anybody
heard of David Marr?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.220
OK, David Marr said vision,
where is what by looking,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.300
what is where by looking?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.430
I just want to say it's
way, way more than that.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.250
The visual system-- I mean,
if vision's half the brain,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.129
that's just a
pretty, puny problem.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.670
So we have to think
of all the things

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.920
that the visual system might do.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.503
And we really haven't
thought of them.

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:58.630
Well here's some more
pictures of a visual system.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.017
So, it's a little bit like, it
started over here on the west

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:03.683
and you go east.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.760
It's sort of like
Russia going all the way

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.980
to the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.600
Vision system really expand.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.380
I think it's kind of
slowed down recently.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.890
I would just say the visual
system is very big in primates.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.870
And if it's half
the brain, well all

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.446
the other stuff, like
greed, sex, power, music,

00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:25.320
all that other stuff.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.480
It's about the same.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.604
So, that means that we just
don't really understand.

00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:32.520
That's a lot of stuff
over there on the right.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.610
That means, on the left,
we don't know squat.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.080
So just have that
in mind, there's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.054
plenty for you to do
as young scientists.

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:40.720
So I don't know.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.660
It must be--

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.760
This is a very tiny list.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.650
It's lots of things.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.962
It's David Marr kind of thing.

00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:46.920
So it's more than that.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.140
I'm going to talk about
visual motor control.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.130
I'm a psychologist.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.080
For some reason, I
think a lot of our--

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.260
Roger Sperry said 70 years
ago that the ultimate arbiter

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.900
of your mind is action.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.260
I mean, if you don't do
something-- if we can have--

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.890
I mean, I studied
perception most of my life,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.240
but if you don't do
something, you're

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.531
not going to pass your genes
on to the next generation.

00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.540
So action is it.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.529
Psychologists, they don't
study action at all.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.029
That's like, they've
forgotten that.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.044
So I just like to put
a plug-in for action.

00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:23.460
There's people who
study the motor

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.200
system that are kind of picky.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.375
So and even if they are, and
don't let you into the field,

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.250
it's important field.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.890
I think you should
push your way in.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.500
I think it's extremely
important for navigation.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.820
Most animals live in a
widely extended space.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.710
They know how to go
home quickly if they're

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.090
trouble and things like that.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.610
I'll talk a little bit about
some kind of animals like that.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.100
The range of area that animals
go over is astonishing.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.110
And so I think the understanding
of animals in their natural

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.710
environment, there's
lots of work on it,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.960
but I think it's-- a lot
of it's quite mysterious.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.600
But I'm just going to talk
mostly about social perception.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.366
And this is the paper
I read a long time ago.

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:04.240
I never met this guy.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.790
His name is Nick Humphrey.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.365
And he wrote this paper, I
don't know, maybe 30 years ago,

00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:11.610
and I just happened
to come upon it.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.430
And it was in a book.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.510
And he said-- he
was not very nice.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.840
He said, experimental
psychology in Britain

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.750
have tended to regard social
psychology as a poor country

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.670
cousin of their subject.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.740
So basically, he
was putting down--

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.839
but he really wasn't
because he really

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:28.880
said something different.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.830
He said, wait a second.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.615
And he sort of turned
psychology upside down.

00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:37.410
And he said, you know, actually,
the social part of intelligence

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.120
is the thing that
drives everything else.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.578
I mean, he might
be overstating it,

00:05:40.578 --> 00:05:41.960
but let's see what
he says, here.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.140
Oh, I'll come back
to that in a minute.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.780
The intellectual
faculties of primates

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.080
have evolved as an adaptation
of complexity of social living.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.000
For better or worse,
styles of thinking which

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.450
are primarily suited to
social problem- solving

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.380
color the behavior of
man and other primates

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.005
even towards the
inanimate world.

00:05:57.005 --> 00:05:59.130
So he's sort of making the
implication when I said,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.924
where does
intelligence come from?

00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:02.340
One of the sources
of intelligence

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.980
are the nature of
the social world.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.150
And it's a quite a
complicated world here,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.420
because this guy, Dunbar.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.590
You've heard of this guy.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.970
He sort of-- I'm not sure
this is a really good study,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.220
but what he did was he made--

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.679
he got the size of the cortex
of lots of different primates

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:18.095
and he made some
kind of estimate.

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.530
I have no idea how he did this.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.912
How many animals
were in their troop.

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:23.370
But you can sort
of imagine, if you

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.890
have a different social
group, it's not just--

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.590
it doesn't just go up by N.
Because let's say, you know,

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.822
it's not just how many
people you have to deal with.

00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:32.280
Those people deal
with other people

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.060
and they might be
plotting against you.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.840
So in other words, the number of
permutations of social behavior

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.340
really--

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.830
I mean, it's only
one other person,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.910
it's not too complicated.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.840
As you get like six,
two people might

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.300
be plotting against the
third one over there.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.390
All kinds of possible
things happen.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.070
And as some of
the primatologist,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.590
if you read some
of the accounts,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.530
there's planned murders of all
kinds of people in the top.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.580
It really looks a little
bit like the Medici's back

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.500
in the Machiavellian
intelligence.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.711
Doesn't sound so weird.

00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:03.210
OK.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.600
So basically, the idea
is that intelligence--

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.840
we have to think of intelligence
in the social world.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.470
I'm just scratching
the surface here.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.740
So let me just talk a
little bit about prediction.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.820
That's kind of what we think
one of the hallmarks of science

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.260
is, prediction, right?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.120
So what are-- in what
area is prediction better?

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.840
Any thoughts.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.416
Suppose I took a rock and
threw it down the mountainside.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.540
I couldn't do squat, right?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.040
I mean--

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.402
AUDIENCE: Well, you could
do all the measuring, right?

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:35.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but nobody's
going to do that, right?

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.745
AUDIENCE: That's
what I'm saying.

00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:38.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.490
Biology, I mean, we
know-- for example,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.242
we know that behavior of
atoms, we can't really

00:07:46.242 --> 00:07:48.450
predict the behavior of
atoms over long trajectories,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.640
but we can show that, you
know, at a certain date,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.180
maybe next year, at Woods Hall,
people from all over the world,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.110
including Nancy, are going to
show up at 9 o'clock, here.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.010
We can predict that.

00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:06.250
And we can predict things
like my alarm clock

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.810
is going to go off tomorrow at
a certain time because I set it.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.800
So what I'm trying
to talk about is

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.680
kind of a point that Dan Dennett
made, who is a philosopher.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.580
Who, I think, has really made
really seminal contributions,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.730
at least to my understanding
of psychology to a large extent

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.167
because he really talks
about explaining things

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:27.000
at different levels.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.800
This is another--

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.960
I started out as a
reductionist in a sense,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.880
but let me just give you, give
you a sort of a thought, here.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.039
Have you ever noticed
that when the moon is

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.460
setting over the Western
sky, it's the new moon.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.729
It sometimes seems
kind of the whole moon

00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:48.270
seems to be illuminated
a little bit.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.853
It's not, it's not
just that crescent.

00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:53.311
If you think of the, if
you think of the sun,

00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:54.810
it should only be
a little crescent.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.110
So why do you see the rest
of the moon filled in?

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.140
Well, there's the possibility
that the sun reflecting off

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.230
the earth, which then sends
light back to the moon.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.220
That's an explanation.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.050
Do we need to know
about photons?

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.581
Do we need to know about
duality of waves and particles?

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.080
No.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.010
That's an explanation.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.330
That's all I'm trying to say.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.580
Some explanations are
pretty darn simple.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.800
And in science, I
think we're looking

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.870
for any fun, interesting
explanation we can find.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.090
So I think Dennett has
nailed it to some extent.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.590
OK.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:30.660
So he basically has three
levels for predicting behavior.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.770
The physical stance.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.050
I mean, if we have ideal
situation of Galileo dropping

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.550
his balls as a
flight that, assuming

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.260
there's no resistance
to air and stuff

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.320
like that, we can
make nice predictions.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.162
Biology and engineering, we know
that you know, seven minutes,

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:45.120
the coffee is going to
be ready, because that's

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.170
what it was designed for.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.020
But then he's got something
called intentional stance,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.490
which is in order to really
understand what people are

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.432
going to do,
Churchland would say,

00:09:55.432 --> 00:09:57.390
well, we go in to look
at their nervous system.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.440
We record from their
neurons and stuff like that.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.190
But Dennett would say,
no, we can't really

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.240
use the physics thing or
even design, we just use

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.900
some other heuristic,
which is very explanatory,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.820
what people desire and
what their beliefs are.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.289
If we know that, we
really can understand

00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:12.330
what they're going to do.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.420
And of course, your grandma knew
that or your great grandmother

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.290
knew that as well.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.690
So but these are really great
ways to understand people.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.660
And so I think
that we can't just

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.310
turn our backs to these things.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.555
And I think Dennett--

00:10:24.555 --> 00:10:26.680
the question is, and we
might come back to the end.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.632
What's the sort
of scientific sort

00:10:30.632 --> 00:10:33.397
of status of some those
types of explanations.

00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:34.230
Are they scientific?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.938
Or what are they?

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.420
Maybe if we have time,
we can talk about that.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.970
OK.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.910
I'll skip that part, here.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.920
So I sort of feel,
just as-- what

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.620
I'm saying is it's a non-
reductionistic way of looking

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.161
at thing-- you should
open your mind.

00:10:48.161 --> 00:10:51.140
And actually, CBMM or
brains, minds, and machines

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.010
is kind of your kind
of condition to that

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.968
because some people come
from computer science.

00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:57.030
I mean, you can't really
understand a computer

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.530
in terms of atoms and molecules.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.321
You really can only
understand the computer

00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:02.070
at some kind of a higher level.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.800
So I'm just telling
you, that's fine.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.710
If you're a neuroscientist and
want to reduce it to synapses,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.950
things like at, good try, but
it might be difficult to do.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.212
There are many other
valid things to do.

00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:15.420
But one of the things to do--

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.600
let's just examine some things
about them and explore them.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.390
I think, as I say, there's
so many possible things

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.350
in this realm.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.330
Doing anything, I mean, people
have all kinds of principles.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.280
My approach in the area,
this kind of area of science,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.270
or any science that I've
done, is to develop new tools,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.690
and then helps you explore.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.190
OK.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.310
So there's lots of
things that humans do.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.950
But what I want to stress in
the first part of this talk

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.030
is that our human social
behavior is really not

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.110
unique in many ways.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.068
There are very, there
are very important things

00:11:48.068 --> 00:11:49.415
that animals do.

00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:51.390
And I'll talk
about them shortly.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.650
Animals, really are very social.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.530
There are certain
animals like octopus,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.230
apparently is not very
intelligent, not very social,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.610
but by and large many
animals are very social.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.580
Doesn't explain
everything but it's--

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.140
I think we share
some core things.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.010
And if we can understand some
of the behavior of animals

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.490
or why they're social and how
their social mechanisms work,

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.170
I think we have a treasure.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.920
So the area of animal behavior
is very underfunded area

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.544
right now.

00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:18.210
I sort of feel--

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.490
I just happen to like
to watch nature videos.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.990
And I'll show you
a few, you'll have

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.610
to indulge me a few of these.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.530
But I sort of feel
these can be more

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.690
important than
careful psychophysics

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.790
because I think they
open your mind to things

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.630
that you may not
have thought about.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.071
So I'm a kind of
devoté of these things.

00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:36.570
OK.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.197
So do animals have an
intentional stance, etc.,

00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:41.280
kinds of things like that?

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.580
We don't know.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.255
Here's a fun video I think
maybe half of the audience

00:12:46.255 --> 00:12:47.130
have seen this video.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.230
And maybe I'll show
the whole thing

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.790
because I think we have time.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.330
It was taken just by chance.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.300
I think it's been
a TV program now.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.820
And I think it's got
like 50 million viewers.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.136
It's about different kinds
of animals interacting,

00:12:59.136 --> 00:13:00.430
their social behavior.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.720
It's about animals that you
do not think are that smart

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.900
and things like that.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.579
Ungulates.

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:06.120
I don't know.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.786
I don't know what
buffaloes are exactly,

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:10.980
but we've never thought
of them as highly

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.690
intelligent or social.

00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:27.800

a huge buffalo.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.285

going to get eaten.

She got him.

at all those buffalo.

go and try chase the lion,

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.795

to chase [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:33.750
There's a big barrier
between lions, crocodiles,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.200
and buffaloes.

him and kicked at him.

He's kicking at him, look.

He's kicking at him.

mean, buffaloes is basically

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.785
used to [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.930
AUDIENCE: The
calf's still alive.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.596
AUDIENCE: It is?

00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:46.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.441
It's trying to get away.

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:49.420
It's standing up.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.362
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:16:50.362 --> 00:16:52.717
It's still alive.

00:16:52.717 --> 00:16:54.480
PROFESSOR: There's
much more to this.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.270
There's many other videos
about lions and buffalo

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.670
finding a layer of baby
lions and the mother is gone.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.280
And they just kill all the
lions in there for revenge,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.839
or whatever it is, your
interpretation, I don't know.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.720
But anyway, so I'm just
trying to tell you.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.006
I'm not going to show you
more, but in the lectures,

00:17:12.006 --> 00:17:13.839
there's going to be a
number of videos here.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.390
I'll show one more I think.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.936
But I think this is--

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.190
I don't know, I think
you can see this is

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.060
better than an experiment, OK?

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.980
You really get--
to me, it really

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.490
showed me a kind of, a kind
of a social organization.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.940
A kind of-- are these
animals conscious?

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.890
All of these kinds of
questions here that I think you

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.761
should think about.

00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:37.260
OK.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.717
So on my website, on
the lecture there's

00:17:39.717 --> 00:17:41.800
going to be some other
videos that you can look at

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.860
and things like that.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.100
I won't do this one, here.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.550
This is a very
interesting video.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.299
Some of you might
have seen it as well.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:48.840
I don't exactly know
what the origin,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.190
I won't show it here today.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.480
But it's about a--

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.560
on the web, it says
monkey teases tiger,

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.450
it's a gibbon, or
something like that.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.170
But it's a really amazing show.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.750
It goes on for
about five minutes.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.840
We're given just swinging
around and making

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.062
himself ready for attack.

00:18:05.062 --> 00:18:07.020
He runs along the ground,
the guys are chasing,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.210
it's like playing tag.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.500
And he runs up a tree
and he jumps over

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.580
them and he their tail
and he grabs their ears.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.640
There are two lions,
two tigers there.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.410
And he's just putting his life
at risk, but he's doing it.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.910
Maybe that's that the theory
is, maybe that's his territory.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.660
He doesn't want those
people around there.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.760
But it's pretty amazing.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.950
So just Google monkey
you know, teases tiger.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.930
You'll see the full video.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.340
It's a pretty damn
amazing video.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.420
Another video that is fairly
interesting and this is just--

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.110
just shows you.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.700
This is a guy named
Jaak Panksepp.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.290
I used to be on a study
section with this guy.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.790
I couldn't figure out what
this guy's talking about.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.170
This was many years ago.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.850
And he's now an expert
on laughter in rats.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:53.360
And he tickles rats and
they follow him around.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.270
And can you hear them laugh?

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.520
No, you can't hear them laugh.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.540
So he got this bat detector
which takes ultrasonic sounds

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.242
and brings it down to
our frequency level.

00:19:04.242 --> 00:19:05.700
And you can hear
the rats laughing.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.120
So try that out as well.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.490
So you can do that
in your spare time.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.720
So he's got some very--

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.220
Oh.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.290
This one is kind of
interesting, War.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.720
One of the interesting
things about--

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.310
We have sort of a whole field
called evolutionary psychology.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:24.300
And what's the reasons why
animals might cooperate a lot?

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.430
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.390
These are really-- a lot of
these things are up in the air.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.660
And there's a lot of
debates, but one possibility

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.400
is, if animals
cooperate, they can

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.100
deal with a rival group
of animals who might

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.840
be taking over their territory.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.671
Animals have private property,
you might call it territory.

00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:44.670
They don't have contracts
or anything like that,

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.790
but it's pretty close.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.710
And if they have territory
that they have and there's

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.780
another group that
has territory,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.573
there's going to be conflicts.

00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:56.720
And why not call it war?

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.330
And humans have had war
for many generations.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.630
And I just like to show
a little bit that--

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.330
these videos are
incredible videos.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.760
The guy's name is
Timothy Clutton- Brock.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.680
He's a ethologist at the
University of Cambridge.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.750
He studied many different
kinds of animals.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.630
And these meerkats--
there's been a,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.622
there's actually been a TV show.

00:20:17.622 --> 00:20:19.080
Have you ever
watched the BBC show?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.980
Anybody here?

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.250
It's a BBC show and it's
gone for four years.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.310
I mean, how long
did Dynasty go for?

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.910
Or all these ones
that you guys watch?

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.010
I mean, four years of this
life of these animals here.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.010
And the really interesting
thing about-- they're

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.090
about one foot tall
and they run in troops.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.120
This group of animals
is really interesting.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.310
There's more animals
than you think.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.250
These are female-
dominated societies.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.170
There's a alpha female.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.530
And she has, she
has many children.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.240
And then her
daughters are supposed

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.000
to take care of her
kids, not their kids.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.610
What happens is sometimes
the daughter wanders off

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.380
and some Romeo was
coming around and they

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.850
had babies and stuff like that.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:04.050
That daughter has to really
be nice to the mom to stay.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.210
Usually she's
banished and she dies,

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.700
or she joins that other troop.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.310
There's so many
different things.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.690
And these animals-- you
can see these guys, here.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.900
See the investigators
on the BBC show--

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.750
these animals somehow have
been totally inured to humans.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.510
So they're doing all their thing
and people are just walking

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.435
around with their cameras.

00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:25.560
So this is-- you don't have
to set up a laboratory,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.730
you just go out there.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.550
And you have to go to
the Kalahari Desert.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.790
But I think that this is
an incredible research

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.250
enterprise that's been
going on for about 10 years.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.950
One of the things is they--

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.720
I think, in many ways, it's
one of the most studied

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.470
social animals because the
Kalahari Desert is just open.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.940
You can see everything.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.410
One of the things they do is
they dig down into burrows.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.992
And so when they're digging way
down-- they can eat scorpions.

00:21:55.992 --> 00:21:57.700
They're not, they're
not bothered if they

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.340
get stung by a scorpion.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.634
But if they're down there
and there's hawks going over,

00:22:01.634 --> 00:22:02.800
they can just pick them off.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.910
So they have these sentries
and things like that.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.340
So they sort of double up--
and then they have babysitting

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.140
co-ops where they're
teenagers that--

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.640
they have these
burrows underground.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.880
But of course you can't-- if
you're growing up as a meerkat.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.340
By the way, meerkats have
nothing to do with cats,

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.890
but they're somehow
related to mongoose.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.860
They're sort of a little
more in that category.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.309
But anyway, they have a
baby sitting kind of thing

00:22:25.309 --> 00:22:26.850
where they let the
kids out on there.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.391
They play a little bit and if
it gets strange, they run back.

00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:32.160
And so there's a whole
babysitting thing

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.740
because every day they have
to go out and forage for food.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.630
And they go very long distances.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.390
The territory of these
meerkats could be

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.370
as much as a square millimeter.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.030
That's amazing.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.613
Just think of these
animals, this big,

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:46.170
going over a square
millimeter, a kilometer.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.070
That's territory.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.734
So what we have, of course,
in the human situation--

00:22:50.734 --> 00:22:52.234
DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR:
Moments later,

00:22:52.234 --> 00:22:56.532
the rest of the whiskers
return from foraging.

00:22:56.532 --> 00:22:58.030
From the brow of
the hill, they see

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.372
that their home has been
overrun by the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:14.060
The rival group spot
the owners of the burrow

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:20.232
and the angry whiskers waste no
time in commencing the attack.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.128
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:22.128 --> 00:23:24.450
DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR:
--Straight towards the whiskers.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.700
They're going to defend
this piece of territory

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.305
as if it's their own.

00:23:28.305 --> 00:23:31.210
A bloody fight is inevitable.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.114
One of these sworn enemies
will have to be in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.015
The [INAUDIBLE] a hasty retreat.

00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:04.010
PROFESSOR: The good guys won.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.545
What I'm going to tell
you is a pale sort

00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:09.020
of version of all
that stuff but I

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.370
think we have to study
stuff in the laboratory.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.030
So a lot of my interest
comes from the work

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.880
of Nalini Ambady who
is a colleague of mine,

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.340
long ago in
psychology department.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.230
And so what--
we're going to go--

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.687
I'm going to talk about
humans now because that's

00:24:23.687 --> 00:24:24.770
what I've been able to do.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.320
I'm not-- But I do
think that we really

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.182
need to look at all different
parts of the animal kingdom.

00:24:30.182 --> 00:24:31.640
But she did something
that's really

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.249
quite interesting as
a social psychologist.

00:24:34.249 --> 00:24:36.790
Mostly people have been handing
out questionnaires and people

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.331
how-- what do you
think about things?

00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:42.290
Social psychology has
mostly been about attitudes

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.350
and had a rightful good
history about prejudice.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.060
And how people who have--

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.476
a lot of the social
psychology came out of the--

00:24:49.476 --> 00:24:52.960
was stimulated by what happened
in the Second World War,

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.249
the atrocities and
things like that.

00:24:55.249 --> 00:24:56.790
How could people do
things like that?

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.498
And so those are really
important things.

00:24:58.498 --> 00:24:59.570
And you read about them.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.986
But she did something
sort of more

00:25:00.986 --> 00:25:03.890
at an everyday level in
a sense, and just take

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.880
pictures, very few pictures
of different people.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.970
And just see what people
get from these pictures.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.510
So clip, movie clips.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.490
And basically, she
did one thing and just

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.690
had people rate
teachers that they--

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.530
this is at Harvard.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.870
We had teaching fellows
and they were just

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.020
talking to their class
and things like that.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.492
And then students just rated
them, what they thought,

00:25:25.492 --> 00:25:27.950
how good a teacher they were,
just on different adjectives.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.250
And that really predicted
the student ratings

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.465
of the whole course.

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:35.977
In other words, 10 seconds was
able to predict the ratings

00:25:35.977 --> 00:25:36.810
of the whole course.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:41.054
So remember that
when you do teaching.

00:25:41.054 --> 00:25:42.220
I'm hopeless, but who knows.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:47.060
Anyway-- Basically, here's
another thing they did.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:47.560
OK.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.160
There's that.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.732
Gaydar, you can tell if
somebody is gay or straight

00:25:51.732 --> 00:25:52.690
or something like that.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.760
It only presenting the thing
for about 15 millisecond.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.310
I find that hard to believe.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.850
If you look at a video, two
people talking together,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.470
you can tell whether they're
friends or strangers.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.630
There was a really
interesting one.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.750
This is really-- outcome is
you have an interview or tapes

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.700
between doctors and patients.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.400
And you can outcome variables
like whether that doctor got

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.100
sued or not.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.970
You can have people
rate, have adjectives

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.190
and it's sort of
like, a little bit

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.830
like-- you can think of
doing machine learning,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.538
just taking all those
adjectives and then

00:26:24.538 --> 00:26:27.410
sort of predict whether that
person is going to be sued.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.170
You can see just by this a
kind of a crowd-sourcing way

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.470
of dealing with all
kinds of real world,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:39.140
social, significant things.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.290
OK.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.160
So I've worked a lot
on face recognition.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.910
That's a very important
thing in the sense

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.040
that in order to negotiate
our social world, if you

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.030
can't do facial recognition,
you're in trouble.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:52.980
I work a lot of people
with prosopagnosic.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.970
Oliver Sacks.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.260
May know who Oliver Sacks is.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.570
He's definitely prosopagnosic.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.230
And if he's at a party,
he's a little bit lost.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.219
But he's a-- he has so many
other charming characteristics

00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:05.010
that he can manage.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.301
People come up and talk to him.

00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:07.770
But you can imagine,
if you're not

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.404
that charming,
witty, funny person

00:27:10.404 --> 00:27:11.820
and you don't
recognize people who

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.940
you're supposed to
recognize, you're in trouble.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.650
One of the subject
I worked with, she's

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.610
a quite a well-known author.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.830
And she goes on book
tours, she's happy,

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.410
and she is she does
very, very well.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.300
She has a problem
with face recognition,

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.370
but she can't really
recognize a lot

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.660
of the guys in her departure.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.670
She teaches-- She's an
English literature professor.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.440
There's about four
guys in our department.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.570
She can't really recognize
one from another.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.860
That makes social
interactions very difficult.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.900
So we all are experts
at face recognition

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.895
but I've studied something
called face blindness.

00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:48.270
But I just want to step back
because the thought occurred

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:48.960
to me.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.580
This is one thing
that's really--

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.780
we've just published, not
myself, but my collaborators,

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.562
we've--

00:27:54.562 --> 00:27:56.020
well, I'll come
back to that later.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.090
It's called face recognition
under early stress.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.300
I'll come back to that later.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.241
Remind me.

00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:01.740
OK.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.530
So over the last 100
years or so, there's

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.440
something called acquired
prosopagnosia which

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.160
means that, I think, the
best case was, I think,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.770
World War II victims,
the German soldiers

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.060
in the Second World War.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.830
And those people, you could
tell they had face recognition

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.120
problems because of course, they
were able to recognize faces,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.190
and later, they
weren't able to do it.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.620
And so-- but more
recently, and I've

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.200
studied hundreds
of these people,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.900
and we've actually signed
up thousands of them.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.300
People-- we just we
put a website out

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.360
and we basically have studied
huge numbers of people

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.720
who are just naturally occurring
people who can't recognize

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.380
faces very well at all.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.980
And we've got about
6,000 registrants.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.247
We really don't test
them that much now,

00:28:49.247 --> 00:28:50.580
but we can test them on the web.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.770
As Nancy mentioned, we
do that kind of thing.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.490
Just some testimonials from
these people, one or two,

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.830
just shows the
problem they have.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.540
This week, I went to the
wrong baby at my son's daycare

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.260
and only realized he was not
my son, blah, blah, blah.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.980
So in an audience
like this, you don't

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.470
have to identify yourself since
you got so many people who

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.390
are STEM people.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.680
STEM people sometimes
have these problems.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.020
Usually if I give a lecture
to an audience like that,

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.240
somebody will come
up and say that's me.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.560
So this is a lady
I know quite well.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.390
She's got a PhD in
differential geometry.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.620
She's a mathematician.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.080
She has lots of problems.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.910
She is one of the
few [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.360
that I think is kind of
mildly on the spectrum.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.850
But most of the people I've
studied are not autistic

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.270
or Asperger's in any way.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.190
But a lot of people
have problem.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.635
I claim it's a visual problem.

00:29:42.635 --> 00:29:44.760
It's not a psychiatric
problem or a social problem,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.930
but it does lead
to social problems.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.270
And with Brad
Duchaine, I've studied

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.050
these people quite extensively.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:52.989
And the thing that--

00:29:52.989 --> 00:29:54.780
I just want to say, in
order to study them,

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.450
we developed a face
recognition test.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.030
I got into the testing
business in this way

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.640
because the tests that were
out there weren't very good.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.889
They were really bad.

00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:04.680
I mean, they were--

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.120
I won't go into
how bad they were.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.460
So we spent three or
four years just making up

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.420
a test, which is now used
widely around the world.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.300
And I don't want to go into
the details of the test

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.235
but it basically
enables people to sort

00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:18.780
of over-learn about six faces.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.890
It's a little bit like
natural face recognition.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.130
It's not-- I think
it's a very good test.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.380
I won't go into why
and things like that.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.300
And it gets harder and harder.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.500
But I just want
to say that we've

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.240
been able to characterize
these prosopagnosia people.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.257
But somebody all of a
sudden shows up and says,

00:30:34.257 --> 00:30:35.340
well, I'm not one of them.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.420
I'm super.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.160
So we've study those
people as well.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.150
I won't go into detail.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.090
We made a lot of
studies about them.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.300
Just a couple of testimonials.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.680
I pretend I don't
remember people

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.304
because people think
I'm stalking them,

00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:49.360
or something like that.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.530
So now we've studied
half a dozen of them.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.910
And now we're studying a much
larger population of them.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.270
I would-- All I'd like to
say is these people are as

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.937
good as prosopagnosics are bad.

00:31:01.937 --> 00:31:04.270
They're really-- but we haven't
found that many of them.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.640
We've probably identified
about 30 of them

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.910
and we've been looking.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.720
And we give them much harder
tests of face recognition.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.520
Some of you, if you
can recognize all four

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.700
of these people before they
were famous, I'll come up

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.647
and you might be one of
our people, but I doubt it.

00:31:18.647 --> 00:31:20.980
Most people think they're
very good at face recognition.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.360
When we test them,
they're not that good.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.950
So nature versus nurture.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.810
Make sure I don't go
over my time, here.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.130
You know, most of
you are not psychol--

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.070
how many people are
psychologists here?

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.630
OK.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.580
So you know that
there's some experiments

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.910
called twin studies
where you study

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.020
some characteristics
in monozygotic twins

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.520
and then different,
dizygotic, dizygotic twins.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.734
And so the idea here is
that they sort of share

00:31:53.734 --> 00:31:54.900
the same family environment.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.330
Of course, each
person's different,

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.585
and they have a different way
of dealing with the family

00:31:57.585 --> 00:31:58.418
and stuff like that.

00:31:58.418 --> 00:32:00.220
But that's the best we can do.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:05.310
But if you can show that the
correlation between twin 1

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.177
and twin 2 is very, very
high, and in our case,

00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:09.510
it's going to be extremely high.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.200
In fact, it's just as high if
twin 1 took the test twice.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.240
That indicates-- and
then if you compare it

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.020
with dizygotic twins, there's
a real difference there.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.110
And that's what we've shown
essentially, is that--

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.460
I'm just saying, the test
reliability is very good.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:32.940
It's tech has a R of
0.7, which is very good.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.320
And we had--

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.680
There's 350 just random people
who took the test twice.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.010
But now what you can do,
we have this online way

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.932
of doing research where we can
just have people come up and--

00:32:43.932 --> 00:32:45.390
the real hard thing
in twin studies

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.695
is not to get monozygotic twins,
it's to get dizygotic twins.

00:32:48.695 --> 00:32:50.820
Dizygotic twins don't really
care about being twins

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.860
that much, but monozygotic
feel, hey, I'm a twin.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:58.140
My wife is a monozygotic twin
so I know all about this.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.440
So we have something called
the Austrian twin registry.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.230
And we pay them and
they-- a very nominal fee

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.766
and they do our tests online.

00:33:05.766 --> 00:33:07.140
And what's really
interesting, we

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.870
found if you correlate
twin 1 and twin 2,

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.040
they have to be obviously
the same gender.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.390
The correlation, you'll
see here, is 0.7.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.120
It's just as good if the
twin took the test twice.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.650
That's pretty darn amazing.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.630
And the dizygotic is 0.3.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.170
So in this particular
situation, I

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.280
think we've shown
to our astonishment

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.730
that the ability of this
face-- the ability to learn

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:34.630
new faces is almost entirely
heritable, whatever that means.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.900
I mean, it's a
technical definition,

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:42.300
but it indicates that your
ability to recognize faces

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.240
is strongly controlled by
other factors than experience.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.830
And that's when I want to bring
up this childhood adversity

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.820
thing, here.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.800
Laura Germine has done a
very large survey of I think,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.480
over 1,000 people who were--

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.240
and these are things-- we had
trouble with the IRB here,

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.450
but people talked about all
of their horrible things that

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.199
happened to them,
childhood sexual abuse,

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:12.570
neglect by their
parents, all kinds

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.719
of things that are really
bad when you're growing up.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.760
And then we did a lot
of tests on the web.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.250
And everything, all our
tests showed real deficits

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.150
in cognitive abilities, in
even emotion recognition,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.630
but there was no deficit
in ability to learn faces.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.880
So that's pretty--
so what I would

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.480
like to suggest is that somehow
we're sort of topped out.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.790
We have enough
experience seeing faces

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.929
and we've reached our asymptote.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.199
That's just a point that
might be of interest here.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.199
So another thing
we've done recently,

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.900
I don't have any data here, but
we just got it paper accepted,

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.469
was to show that using
the same sort of paradigm

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.780
of monozygotic and
dizygotic twins

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.460
that face
attractiveness is not--

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.560
there's no genetic component
at all, basically zero.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.450
So here's a face attractiveness
test that we've cooked up here.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.502
Here's a bunch of faces.

00:35:10.502 --> 00:35:12.210
You have a bunch of
cards, you sort them.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.680
That's all you do.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.260
You get the mean ratings
for all the faces

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.820
and then you rate the faces.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.760
And I'm going to
say, OK, you're--

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.490
let's say that upper
left- hand corner,

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.190
that's one person's ratings
versus the mean ratings.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.190
That's a correlation of 0.74.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.970
The next person's 0.91.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.920
That's really unimaginable
to me that, that person

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.287
there's correlation with
the mean rating is so high.

00:35:37.287 --> 00:35:38.370
And look at these ratings.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.600
They're very, very high.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.912
Of course, these are
Harvard undergraduates.

00:35:41.912 --> 00:35:43.620
They all have the same
kind of mentality.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.480
Perhaps that's maybe
that's the point.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.760
But the correlation
with the mean, this

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.860
is just from one of my courses.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.670
It's unbelievable.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.190
The correlation, the
agreement of who's attractive

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.780
and who's not attractive
is astonishing.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:01.260
So what we did was we had
these MZ versus DZ twins

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.640
and had them rate them.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.320
We have a kind of a jingle.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.850
We say, how quirky are you
when you're a beauty judge,

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.520
or something like that
because our web site,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.230
we don't pay anybody.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.170
In the twin study, we do, but
we like to make the tests fun

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.610
and interesting to the people.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.290
And we, most of
the time, give them

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.850
feedback as to how they done.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.470
So all I'm trying
to tell you there

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.460
is that we don't see any genetic
component there at all when

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.870
you do the monozygotic
and dizygotic twins, here.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.270
Gender versus attractiveness.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.510
Where you give a bunch of
pictures to people and you say,

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.420
which looks more
feminine, more masculine?

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.240
You do that with girls and
then you do it with boys.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.430
Which was more
masculine, feminine?

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.850
Those are very
reliable ratings also.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.480
It's hard to see but female
attractiveness correlates very

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.930
well with the gender judgment,
male attractiveness doesn't.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.180
Actually male attractiveness
is quite robust.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.610
People can agree on
male attractiveness,

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.540
but it's not the gender axis.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.820
Maybe you know, 2000 years ago
it was machoness or something

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.320
like that.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.430
But in our society, it's agreed
upon but it's a little bit

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.930
mysterious.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.000
Alex Todorov has
published a paper

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.560
on this, which I
don't understand.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.680
But he says he explains
it, but I'm not sure.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.440
But that's an interesting
area of what constitutes

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.510
male attractiveness.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:23.350
A fellow, who is an MIT
student, Richard Russell,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.470
found one of the
things that is related

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.000
to female attractiveness.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.340
It's basically contrast,
facial contrast.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.340
Not how dark you are,
but your facial contrast.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.200
And he just found
that if you just

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.120
measured the
contrast of pictures,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.760
you find the female
average contrast is

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.280
higher than the male contrast.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.840
And if you take a
picture like that,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.790
which is an androgynous person
here, and you just change--

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.280
you have the same picture and
you just increase the contrast,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.640
the one on the left
looks more female.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.070
And maybe that's the reason
that Richard thinks that this

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.720
is the basis of some cosmetics.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.860
And he works with
a cosmetic company.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.311
He's not doing--

00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:04.810
OK.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.330
So the final part of this
talk, I'd like to talk about

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.590
is that, which I'm more
involved in right now.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.570
Is I sort of feel that
most of social psychology

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.000
is involved in kind
of asking people

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.619
questions and things like
that about sociology.

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:20.410
But as I said in the
beginning of the talk,

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.057
I feel that the
realm of human action

00:38:22.057 --> 00:38:23.890
is something that has
not been investigated.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.840
So I just feel it's something
that we need to probe.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.540
And what I would
like to argue is

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.150
that by studying
our human actions,

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.370
we can actually reveal
our social perceptions.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.060
That's kind of the point here.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.456
So most of you have been
in very crowded places

00:38:39.456 --> 00:38:41.580
and you don't bump into
people and stuff like that.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.070
And there's many
reasons for that.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.580
But basically it's
pretty amazing

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.290
that people, pretty much,
don't run into each other

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:51.760
in very crowded and when
they're very rushed.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.450
And there are many situations in
which your social interactions

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.900
with people are extremely
skilled in a sense,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.300
in different kinds
of dancing or fencing

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.340
or different kinds of athletics.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.510
So I claim this is
the domain of what

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:11.030
I call rapid social perception.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.050
So how can we study
rapid social perception?

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.732
Well, I'm OK with
all these things,

00:39:17.732 --> 00:39:19.190
showing movies and
stuff like that.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.064
But we've sort of put
it into the laboratory,

00:39:21.064 --> 00:39:24.800
in a more discrete fashion just
because we can study it easily.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.502
Now one of them is
that most of you

00:39:26.502 --> 00:39:28.210
watch the World Cup,
is the penalty kick.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.250
It doesn't happen all the time,
but every once in a while,

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:30.760
it happens.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.370
And you know, that's a
really dramatic moment.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.890
And of course, you
have to predict

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.170
which way the kicker
is going to go ahead

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.760
of time if you're the goalie.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.800
So we've set up something which
was sort of parallel to it

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.600
which I call the
lab version, here.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.890
So here's the kicker, here.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:54.430
But the job is not to kick
the ball into the area,

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.060
but just touch
target left or right.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.880
That's your job.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.730
That's all you do.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.020
Go boom, boom.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.040
That's it.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.830
That's the trial.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.850
So it's very simple.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.560
And we tell people it's a game.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.740
If you are up to the game--

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.660
The blocker-- if you get
there within 150 mil--

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.830
we sort of titrate it to match
the skill of the two people.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:15.550
But it's a game.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.536
Harvard undergraduates
love the game.

00:40:17.536 --> 00:40:18.910
They get tired
because a little--

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.560
but there's no problem.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.920
Harvard undergraduates don't
know each other usually

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.820
so they're not friends
or anything like that.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.750
They just, they
just come in there.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.240
So I think there's a
movie here as well.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.380
Let's see if I can
get this going here.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.760
Oh, here, go this way.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.380
OK.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.760
So this is the game, here.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.719
Is it moving?

00:40:44.719 --> 00:40:45.260
There you go.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.390
Here.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:48.050
That's it.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.260
That's the game.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.670
I like pretty
simple experiments.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:53.250
OK.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.180
So but then what we do is
we just measure the finger

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.940
position of the two players.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.190
You can just buy these things.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.290
They are off the shelf.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.740
They're not very expensive.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.530
The one I had like you know,
a couple of thousand dollars

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.370
these days.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.020
This is very low tech.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.000
It measures the
position of the fingers

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.810
and at a high precision, very
fast, and stuff like that.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.080
You can buy this thing.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.480
It takes a while to get it
going and stuff like that.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.580
So basically, we can
map the trajectories

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.970
of the various people.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.135
And you can see that
they're well- behaved.

00:41:29.135 --> 00:41:31.040
And just like that.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.930
So what's interesting
is the timing here.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:37.170
So the kicker goes like
this and the blocker--

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.180
so you can make little
measurements, here.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.900
And so we can just measure the
horizontal positions, here.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.509
So the blue is the kicker
and the red is the blocker.

00:41:45.509 --> 00:41:47.550
And so obviously, they
can't do at the same time.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.340
But the reaction
times are interesting.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.600
What's that difference in
the launch point, there.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:02.120
And what we found was it
was actually very low.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.710
You can see it there.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:08.720
Some were as low as 100
milliseconds but it's 150--

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.610
it's lower than choice
reaction times normally.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.880
So if you take-- if you
could have a button box

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.160
and put a buzzer or
something like that,

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.620
choice reaction
times are usually

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.390
about 100 milliseconds longer.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.070
So what's going on here?

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.940
But maybe choice reaction time
isn't a really good choice.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.420
So what we did was we took--

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.180
we actually can take the
position of the finger

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.930
and map it on the screen.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.250
And we have a little experiment
here, where you actually--

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.090
instead of playing
against a person,

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.430
you just, there's a little
dot that zooms up there

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:42.540
and you do that.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.860
So maybe it's that--
the fact of that.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.070
So we do this, and
that's the experiment.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.880
And it turns out
this experiment,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.380
we're about 100
milliseconds longer.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.630
So in other words, if you're
playing against the human

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.840
being, that's on average
about 100 milliseconds.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.770
So you are faster when you're
dealing with human being.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:07.490
I will just skip over
some of this stuff, here.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:11.210
And again, there's
no learning here.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.270
Basically, it's just, it's flat.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.340
So what's going on here?

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.370
We think what's happening here,
and this is the punch line,

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.050
I'll just elaborate
a little bit more.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.790
You think all through
your life you've

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.070
seen people do different
kinds of actions.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.740
And if you do any
kind of action,

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.050
there's all kinds of
postural adjustments.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.900
I was just talking to one of
the guys in Emilio Bizzi's lab.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.000
If you're sort of in
different kinds of sports,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.580
if you lunge like that,
what's the first muscles

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.900
that contract?

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.600
Anybody want to know?

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.610
Your butt.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:50.610
Because that's to maintain
your center of gravity.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.800
So there's all kinds of--

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.297
I'm not saying people will
watch you know, their butts

00:43:55.297 --> 00:43:56.130
and stuff like that.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.610
But when you make
any kind of motion,

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.580
it's your whole
body is connected.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.760
And somehow we have
knowledge, implicitly of this.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.530
So what's going on here?

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.130
We talk about 90
milliseconds or so.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.260
What section of the
body informative?

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.510
Well, in a sense this is
kind of-- you just block off

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.051
different pieces
and stuff like that.

00:44:16.051 --> 00:44:18.080
And we just, we have
all different kinds

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.550
of ways we can just--

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.220
limited.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.770
And we do-- we did all kinds
of experiments like that.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:27.110
And basically, if
you show all, there's

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.330
an advantage, just the
torso or just the head

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.035
and there's the computer,
it's all over the place.

00:44:32.035 --> 00:44:33.410
That the information
is all over.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.694
But that's not
unreasonable because when

00:44:35.694 --> 00:44:37.610
you're doing something,
all parts of your body

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.510
are connected.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.780
So there's quite an advantage.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.801
I think basically, oh,
this is your question.

00:44:44.801 --> 00:44:45.800
We're moving this stuff.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.480
So we have-- we call
them cut videos here.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.380
So what we do is we
play a video, here.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.950
By the way, we now
have shown that people

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:56.720
would behave exactly
the same to a video

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.380
than they do to
the other person.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.050
So that makes the
life a little simpler.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.240
So there we go.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.830
There's-- I don't know if you
can tell, but essentially,

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.770
nobody, except a couple
of star athletes,

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.880
could tell what it was.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.060
And it turns out, in the
cut videos, in other words,

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.780
you don't have that
preparatory stuff.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.370
You just have all that
if the person is still,

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:21.380
we don't even know
what those motions are.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.660
But basically, they're
100 milliseconds slower

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.720
than the cut videos.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.445
So another thing
is, oh, we even did

00:45:28.445 --> 00:45:30.320
stuff-- we did another
series of experiments.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.794
Well, maybe it's eye movements.

00:45:31.794 --> 00:45:33.710
And basically, we just
did some more blocking.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.140
And shoulders are important,
you can see, here.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.270
Oh, I didn't show that.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.436
I don't have the data there.

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:43.770
But basically every-- even
the head, there's a little--

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.270
all of those, the first
five, except the last one,

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:47.460
were very good.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.914
Even the last one, you
can hardly see anything.

00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:51.330
You just see the
head then you see

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:54.734
the eye movement is a little
bit of an advantage, even there.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.780
OK.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.070
So basically, what I'm
trying to say more broadly,

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:12.330
is that our ability to
understand humans probably more

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.400
to predict what
they're going to do

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.090
is something that we've
learned somewhat unconsciously.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.340
We're going to do a lot of
machine learning of what

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.510
parts of the body it is.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:22.885
And all kinds of
stuff like that.

00:46:22.885 --> 00:46:24.450
I'm interested in
if you people have

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.241
some ideas of what
other kinds of things we

00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:28.710
can do to generalize this.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.140
But I think it's
an area where we--

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.450
it helps us understand
all the kind of knowledge

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.880
that we do have of
other people that we

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:42.740
can weed out in ways that are
very subtle, but reliable.

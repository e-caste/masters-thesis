00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.266
LORNA GIBSON: So I should
probably get started.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.640
So I just wanted to mention
this Friday the libraries are

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.110
having Furry Friday.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.870
So they have therapy dogs
come, and if you like dogs,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.240
it's kind of fun to go
get cuddled by the dog.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.430
The other thing I wanted
to mention, last term,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.380
there was a student taking
3032 who was interested in art.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.300
And I kept trying to find
art pictures for him,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.160
and he's not here.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.930
But I thought everybody
else can like the art too.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130
So I belong to the Peabody
Essex Museum in Salem, Mass.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.370
And they have an
exhibit right now

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.590
on wood and on sort of using
wood as a sculptural material.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.540
And this is one of their
posters to advertise it.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.260
So this thing was carved out
of a single piece of wood,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.130
I think.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.690
And they've got lots of other
sort of sculptural wood.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.120
So I thought you might
like to see that.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.171
If you wanted to go to Salem,
there's a couple of options,

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.170
if you don't have a car.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.260
You can take a
commuter rail to Salem.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.840
You can also take the ferry.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.840
And if you take
the ferry to Salem,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.424
it's like a five minute walk
to where the ferry lets you off

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:26.590
to get to the Peabody Essex.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.650
And it's a kind of neat museum.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.460
It's not too big.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.677
It's kind of small.

00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:32.260
But it's a beautiful building,
and they have neat stuff there.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.997
So you could go to the
Peabody Essex Museum.

00:01:34.997 --> 00:01:35.871
Hmm?

00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:36.310
STUDENT: It's very nice.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.893
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
you've been there?

00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:39.390
Yeah, it's really nice.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.000
So I was going to talk about
honeycomb-like materials

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670
in nature today.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.290
And I'm going to talk
about wood today,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.470
and I might finish this today.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.990
I might not.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.880
And then I'm going
to talk about cork

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.820
for a little bit on
Wednesday, and then we'll

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.930
start talking about
foams after that.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.290
So I have a couple of sort
of cute little language

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.680
historically things.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.400
And you know how I
like that stuff too.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.684
So I have two things about
words that are related to wood.

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:10.350
So the word "materials--"
you know where

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.930
the word materials comes from?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.090
It comes from the Latin.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.510
So there's a Latin
"materies materia."

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.510
And materies
materia means "wood"

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.850
or "the trunk of a tree."

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.920
So if you think of studying
materials, in olden times

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.796
that was like studying wood.

00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:29.060
And another cute thing that
I found was that in old Irish

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.040
the names of the first few
letters of the alphabet

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800
are named after trees.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.120
So the letter A, that's
called alem in old Irish,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.732
and alem is the word for elm.

00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:40.815
And B is-- I don't know
if I'm saying these right.

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:43.460
It's called beith, and
that's the word for birch.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.470
And C is call.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.640
That's the word for hazel.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.840
And D is dair, and
that's the word for oak.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.070
And so they sort of named
the letters of the alphabet

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.955
after different kinds of trees,
different kinds of woods.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.330
So I just thought
those were kind

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.980
of interesting
historical things.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.582
So I wanted to start by
talking about wood structure.

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:02.290
And then we're going
to look at how would

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.340
deforms and fails, and
talk about the data

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.060
that people have
measured for the wood

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.045
properties, things like
stiffness and strength.

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:12.670
And then we'll talk a little bit
about how the honeycomb models

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.150
can be applied to understanding
the mechanical properties

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.200
of woods.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.460
So this is kind of a generic
trunk of the tree here.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.650
And we're defining three axes.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.650
The radial axis comes
radially out of the tree.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.330
There's the tangential axis, so
that's the x1 and the x2 axes.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.010
And then there's
the longitudinal

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.650
or the axial axis, x3.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.230
So if you think of
the wood as being,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.220
in a very, very simple way,
just like the honeycomb,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.650
the radial would be this way on.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.025
The tangent would
be that way on.

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:43.390
And that axial would
be that way on.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.800
So it's like that.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.330
And if you neglect
the growth rings,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.070
you can say that other
woods orthotropic,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.440
and that's typically
what people do.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.064
They neglect the
growth rings, and they

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.430
say that it's orthotropic.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.030
And the density of the
woods, the relative density

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.170
ranges from about 5% for
balsa wood to about 80%

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.170
for lignum vitae.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.810
So I brought in
some pieces of wood.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.780
So this is balsa wood.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780
You're probably familiar,
making different kinds

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.239
of models with balsa.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.155
So balsa's very light.

00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:09.780
It grows in Ecuador.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.660
And it's the lightest wood.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.730
And this is lignum vitae.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.480
You're probably not
so familiar with that.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.500
This actually grows in Florida,
and it's the densest wood.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.450
It has a relative
density of 0.8.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.910
And it's so dense, that if
you put it in water, it sinks.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.440
So it's a very dense wood.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.370
And the way the
wood cells grow is

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.380
that if you look at the sort
of structure here of a tree,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.340
there's the bark on
the outside here,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.140
and then there's the kind of
wood cells inside the bark.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.770
And there's a layer of
cells in between the bark

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.080
and the wood called
cambial layer.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.830
And that's really the
layer of cells that

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.480
are alive and are dividing.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.400
So if you think
of the wood cells,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.890
they're living when they're
in that little cambial layer

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.700
there.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.930
And they're dividing.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.000
And that cambial
layer, the cells

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.750
have a plasma membrane
and a protoplast.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.414
And then they sort of
exude the plant cell wall.

00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:06.080
So a little like bone
cells, like if you

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.930
think of the bone in
your body, there's

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.450
osteoblasts and osteoclasis,
different kinds of bone cells.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.090
But the bone cells secrete
the sort of collagen

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.000
and the calcium
phosphate that are

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.680
the sort of hard mineral part
of the bone that you think about

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.440
in the bone.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.690
And that's not a living thing.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.981
The cells are the living thing.

00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:25.002
That's like an
extracellular matrix.

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:26.710
In the trees, it's a
little bit the same.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.890
So there's the living cells
that are just under the bark,

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.580
and they have this plasma
membrane and the protoplasm.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.700
And over a few weeks they
excrete the plant cell wall,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.620
and then they die.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.510
So the living cells
die, and you're

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.210
left with the plant cell walls.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.930
And then as the
tree grows, you're

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.250
always having a layer
of these cambial cells,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.910
and it forms bark on the
outside and wood on the inside.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.860
So there's sort of a layer of
cells that are differentiated,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.010
such that on the outer
layer they form the bark,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.920
and on the inner layer
they form the wood.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.080
And as the tree grows,
that cambial layer

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.700
is kind of expanding
out radially.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.422
So let me write some
of these things down.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.286
Let's see.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.660
So let me just write down
those two little word things

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.868
because I think they're cute.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:33.615
So the word materials is from
the Latin materies materia.

00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:44.960
And that means "wood" or
the "trunk of a tree."

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.257
And here's the little
old Irish thing.

00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:50.090
It's not like I think--
I'm not going to put

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.070
this on the test or something.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.195
I just thought it was cute.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:03.570
So the letter A is
alem, which is elm.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:11.150
And letter B is
beith, which is birch.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.240
Letter C is call.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.370
That's hazel.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.080
And D was dair, and that's oak.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.708
So that's just for
general interest.

00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:36.810
So then the wood structure we
can think of it as orthotropic,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.885
if we ignored the growth rings.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.960
And if you have a sort
of large diameter tree

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.320
and you take a piece of wood
not from the very center,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.340
but from somewhere
near the outside,

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.320
then that's not a
bad approximation.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.320
Now, the relative
density of the woods

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:14.610
ranges from about 0.05 for balsa
to about 0.8 for lignum vitae.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.644
Any Latin scholars here?

00:08:21.644 --> 00:08:23.310
I took one year of
Latin in high school.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.875
Anybody take Latin?

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:25.570
No, no Latin.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.445
So I think lignum vitae I
think is "tree of life."

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:31.090
"Vitae" is the sort of life.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.559
And when it has this ending
A-E it means "of life."

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:38.419
So I think that's the "tree
of life" is lignum vitae.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.679
So trees have cambial
layer beneath the bark.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.640
And the cell division occurs
in that cambial layer.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.135
So the new cells on the
outer part turn into bark,

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.760
and the new cells on the
inner part turn into wood.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:51.300
And then we have the
living plant cells

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.420
that have the plasma
membrane and the protoplast.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:10.530
And those cells then
secret the plant cell wall,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.020
which sort of surrounds them.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.490
So in trees, the living cells
lay down the plant cell wall

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.380
over a period of a few weeks.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.720
And then the living cells die.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.780
Oops.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.280
Back.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.779
Here.

00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:28.340
Now you always retain a
layer of those cambial cells.

00:11:32.054 --> 00:11:33.720
So you may have heard
if you have a tree

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.010
and you cut a ring around
the tree through the bark,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.740
if you go into
those cambial cells

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.770
and you destroy them,
you kill the tree,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.726
because you're killing
that layer of living cells.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.740
So then we want to look at the
cellular structure of the woods

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.590
as well.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.290
And I've got a couple
of slides here.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.060
This one is of softwoods.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.230
And softwoods have
two types of cells.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.700
That have tracheids, which are
the bulk of the cells here,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.480
and the tracheids provide
structural support.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.410
And the tracheids
also have little holes

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.760
along the length of them
at their ends called pits,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.620
and those pits allow fluid
transport up and down the tree.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.060
And then the softwood also
has these ray cells here.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.230
So those are examples
of ray cells.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.600
So this is a transverse section.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.820
This is a longitudinal
section here.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.060
And the rays are parenchyma
cells which store sugars.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.820
So softwoods have
tracheids and rays.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.950
And then hardwoods, here's
an example of a hardwood oak.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.620
They have three types of cells.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.210
There's cells called fibers,
so these guys all in here

00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.960
would be fibers.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.890
They provide the
structural support.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.030
They have vessels,
these really large cells

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.600
that provide fluid transport
up and down the tree.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.040
And they also have rays.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.770
So here are some rays here.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.890
And again, those rays
are parenchyma cells

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.250
that store sugars in the tree.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.380
So let me just write down
what all these cells are.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.790
So in softwoods
most of the cells

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.930
are these tracheids,
so they make up

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:33.250
the bulk of the tree,
something like 90% of the tree.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.900
And they provide
structural support.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.453
They have holes in the cell
wall for fluid transport,

00:13:52.453 --> 00:13:53.536
and those are called pits.

00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:04.990
And to give you some idea
of what size they are,

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.750
they're are a few millimeters
long, so something like 2

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.700
and 1/2 to seven
millimeters long.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.970
And then they're tens of microns
in the other two directions,

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.430
so they're something like
20 to 80 microns across.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.840
And the cell wall thickness,
t, is usually a few microns,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.820
so something between about
two and seven microns.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.330
So typically, the
denser the wood,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.610
the thicker the cell
wall's going to be.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.810
Whoops, let's see if I can
get the rays down here.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.054
Put it on the same board.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.893
So the rays are parenchyma
cells that store sugar.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.680
And then the hardwoods
have three types of cells.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.600
They have the fibers that
provide the structural support.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.760
And the amount of
cells that are fibers

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.330
varies, depending
on the species,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.315
but it's usually somewhere
around 35% to 70% of the cells.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.251
And then they the vessels,
which are the sap channels.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.318
That provides for the
conduction of fluids.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.550
And that's between about
6% and 55% of the cells.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:09.385
And then, again, there's
rays that store sugars,

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.994
and they usually make a boat
10% to 30% of the cells.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.910
So there's the structure of
this sort of cellular structure,

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.536
at this kind of length
scale of tens of microns.

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:28.910
And then there's
also a structure

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.170
within the cell wall itself.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:37.120
And the cell wall itself is
made up of cellulose fibrils

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.540
in a matrix of lignin and
something called hemicellulose.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.430
So if you look at the
cellulose structure,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.070
the cellulose has a
regular structure,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.980
a sort of periodic lattice.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.560
And it's crystalline for most
of the length of the fibrils.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.100
So this is the structure
of the cellulose here,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.690
and this is showing it at a
slightly larger length scale.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.690
It might have a crystalline
region here and then

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.760
a non-crystalline region here.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.900
And these macro fibrils,
which are made up

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.210
of bundles of micro fibrils,
are about 10 to 25 nanometers.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.740
And each one of
the micro fibrils

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.109
might be three to four
nanometers across.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.420
So you have these
cellulose fibers.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.520
And then the cell wall is
made up of different layers.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.160
So there's what's called
the primary wall here,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.410
which has a random arrangement
of the cellulose fibrils.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.150
Then there's an
outer layer here.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.910
These are all called
secondary layers.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.160
This is S-- I think that's S1.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.220
Yeah, it's S1.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.880
And it has this
arrangement of the fibrils.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.370
Then there's a layer called
S2, and it's generally

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.610
the thickest layer
in the cell wall.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.670
And the cellulose fibrils are
aligned not perfectly vertical,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.460
but a little off the vertical.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.880
And the angle
between the vertical

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.940
and the orientation of
the cellulose fibers

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.200
is called the microfibril angle.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.400
And then there's a
third layer here, S3,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.790
with, again, a different
winding of the fibers.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.930
So because S2 layer
is the thickest layer

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.910
and because the fibrils are
closest to the vertical axis,

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.790
the S2 layer
actually contributes

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.950
the most to the longitudinal
modulus and stiffness

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.550
and strength of the cell wall.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.830
So that's kind of the
arrangement of the cell wall.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.062
And then so that one
cell would have that.

00:18:26.062 --> 00:18:27.270
Another cell would have that.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.640
And in between the
two, there's a layer

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.226
called the middle lamella that
kind of glues them together.

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:32.850
So that's the
arrangement of the cells.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.060
Let me scoot over here.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.800
So the cells are often modeled
as a fiber reinforced composite

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.110
that has four layers to it.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.380
And in each layer there's
different volume fraction

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.970
of the fibers and different
orientation of the fibers.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.525
So the cell wall has this
fiber-reinforced structure.

00:19:30.285 --> 00:19:36.210
Here's the cellulose
fibers in a matrix

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.440
of lignin and hemicellulose.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.805
And there's four layers,
each with the fibers

00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:51.930
in a different orientation.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.826
And then there's the middle
lemella between the two cells.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.632
So in doing the modeling
of a material like wood,

00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:41.840
you need to know what the
properties of the cell wall

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.150
material are, because,
obviously, the properties

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.027
of the wood would depend on
the cell wall properties.

00:20:47.027 --> 00:20:48.610
And it turns out
that they're similar.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.318
They're not exactly
the same, but they're

00:20:50.318 --> 00:20:52.500
similar in different
species of wood,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.790
so we're going to call
them more or less the same.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.940
So the density of the
solid is 1,500 kilograms

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.160
per cubic meter.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.330
The modulus of the solid
in the axial direction

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.180
is 35 gigapascals.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.930
The modulus in the tangential
direction or transverse

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.370
direction is 10 gigapascals.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.400
And the strength of the
solid in the axial direction

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.890
is 350 megapascals.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.870
And the strength of the
transverse direction

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.760
is about 135.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:48.606
So here A means Axial
direction, and T is transverse.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:03.130
And just for comparison, if
you just look at cellulose,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.690
cellulose has some pretty
amazing properties.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:11.120
The modulus of cellulose is
about 140 gigapascals, which

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.040
is very high for a polymer.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.400
And the strength
of cellulose fibers

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.830
run between about 700
and 900 megapascals.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.300
So the cellulose fibers have
very impressive properties.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.415
And that's one of the
things that gives wood

00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:27.290
very good properties.

00:23:04.482 --> 00:23:05.940
So the next thing
is I want to show

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.792
you some stress-strain
curves for wood.

00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:10.000
And you'll see how similar
they are to the honeycombs

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.500
that we looked at before.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.600
And then we'll look at how
the cells are deforming

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.950
as they're getting loaded.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.908
And from that, we're
going to do some modeling.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.135
So let me just wait till
people get caught up.

00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:26.540
Are we caught up?

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.700
More or less?

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.770
OK.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.310
So these are all
compression curves,

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.400
so I'm just going to
talk about compression.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.980
So these are curves for
different types of woos.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.790
And on the left,
the wood is loaded

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.680
in the tangential direction.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.290
So in terms of the sort
of honeycomb model,

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.840
it's loading at kind of
this way on, like that.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.590
And on the right, are a
set of curves for wood load

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.070
it in axial compression.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.480
So in axial compression loading,
we're loading it that way on.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.440
And we've got
different species here.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.460
So the lowest density is balsa,
around about 100 kilograms

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.680
per cubic meter.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.630
The densest species
on this plot is

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.190
beech, which is around 700
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.580
And then there's pine and
willow, some other species in

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.540
between here.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.090
So you can see the shapes of the
curve look just like the curves

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.540
that we had for the honeycombs.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.300
So here there's a
linear elastic bit.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.600
There's a stress plateau.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.320
And there's a densification bit.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.380
And then, as the density
goes up, it gets stiffer,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.290
and the strain at which
the densification occurs

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.680
gets smaller, and the
strength gets higher.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.800
And if we look at
the axial properties,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.490
the shape of the
curve is similar.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.320
We get linear elastic stress
plateau densification.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.910
But if you look
at the scale here,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.870
this scale goes from 0 to
100, whereas that scale

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.690
went from 0 to 20.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.660
And so the stiffness and
the strength along the grain

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.620
are much higher than they
are across the grain.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.550
And you probably
already know that.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.820
Wood is stronger and
stiffer along the grain

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.710
than across the grain.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.650
So that's what the stress-strain
curves looked like.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.240
And the fact that we're
getting the curves that

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.700
look like that
makes us think maybe

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.440
the mechanisms of
deformation and failure

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.180
are similar to the
honeycomb, too.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.460
So here's a set of
curves for balsa

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.730
all plotted on the same scale.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.789
And, again, you can see for
loading across the grain,

00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:20.830
either in the radial or
the tangential direction,

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.205
the stiffness and
the strength is

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:25.120
a lot less than if you load
it in the axial direction.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.230
So a number of years ago,
we had a project on balsa.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.950
And the thing we were
interested in doing

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.760
was looking at how the
cells deformed and failed.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.550
And because balsa's
a low-density wood,

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.090
it was easier to see the
deformation in the cells,

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.540
because the cells were thin.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.220
So that's why we chose balsa.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.770
I actually have a project
on balsa right now.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.046
And [? Sardar ?], my postdoc,
is doing more detailed kind

00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:48.170
of finite [INAUDIBLE]
modeling, trying to represent

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.372
the structure of balsa.

00:25:49.372 --> 00:25:50.830
And I think I
mentioned, the reason

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.371
we're interested in
it is the balsa's

00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:57.230
used as a core in sandwich
panels in wind turbine blades.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.370
It's actually the best
material that they can find,

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.720
it's better than any
engineering material.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.160
So that's comparing the
three curves for balsa.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.850
And then if you look
at a specimen that's

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:14.730
loaded in the [? SCM ?],
with a loading stage,

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.540
you can measure the
stress-strain curve,

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.550
and you can take
photographs of what

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.890
the cellular structure looks
like at different stages

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:21.800
of loading.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.750
So here, this picture
one, is unloaded.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.180
And these four images
here are looking

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.580
at the same section of cells,
the same area of cells.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.330
And you can see there's
a big vessel here,

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.030
and that's the
same vessel there.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.680
So here, this image
two, is at this point

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.920
on the stress-strain curve.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.500
Here's three, at that point.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.900
And four is at that point.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.842
So if you look at
this carefully--

00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:46.050
and I've got another higher
mag picture I'll show you

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.360
in a second-- you can
see that what's happening

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.620
is the cell walls are bending.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.770
So it's kind of like taking
my honeycomb like this,

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.603
and I'm doing that to
it, and the cell walls

00:26:53.603 --> 00:26:55.850
are bending, so just the
same as the honeycomb.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.760
And then eventually,
if I load it enough,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.710
you get to this sort
of densified stage.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.100
And you're doing this, and
the stress-strain curve

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.660
increases sharply.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.620
So here you can see how the
cells have densified over here.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.780
It kind of looks a
lot like my honeycomb

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.740
when I-- maybe I
do it this way--

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.840
when I smush it up like that.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.890
It looks kind of similar.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.900
So if we look at the
higher mag picture,

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.270
again, these four images are
the same area of the cells.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.530
And if you look at that
a little bit of crud,

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.410
it's the same on all
four of them there.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.540
So this is the unloaded one.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.720
And these were loaded
from top to bottom.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.310
And this is loaded to some
extent/ that's loaded more,

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.600
and that's loaded more.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.357
So if you look at
this cell here,

00:27:36.357 --> 00:27:37.690
it's got this little tear on it.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.397
So you can sort
of find it again.

00:27:39.397 --> 00:27:40.980
If you look at that
cell there, that's

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.510
what it looks like unloaded.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.780
And here you can see--
see that wall there?

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.110
You can see how it's bent up.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.280
So it's bent like
the honeycomb walls.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.720
And here it's bent even more.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.590
And eventually, it has
this sort of a shape here,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.154
and it's deformed permanently.

00:27:57.154 --> 00:27:58.820
It's formed one of
these plastic hinges.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.830
So it's like the aluminum
honeycombs almost,

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.430
that it's filled like that.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.930
So in the balsa
wood, when we load it

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.840
in the tangential
direction, we're

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.070
getting bending of the cell
walls and then yielding

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.030
and plastic hinges forming,
just the same as we

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.500
would in an aluminum honeycomb.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.420
Are we good with that?

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.211
Well, I'll go through
all three directions.

00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:19.310
And then I'll write
down the notes.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.890
So this is loading the balsa
in the radial direction.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.930
And these things
here are the rays.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.410
So we're loading it
in that direction.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.900
And here you see this
also bending occurs,

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.840
but the rays act a little
bit like fiber reinforcement.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.590
So the rays are a
little bit stiffer,

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.770
and they sort of
reinforce the thing a bit.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.480
And this is the
loading platten here,

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.690
and you can kind of see that the
failure starts at the loading

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.650
platten, and as you
sort of load up more,

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.490
it progresses in from
the loading platten.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.420
So we're going to
look at the modeling

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.630
of the balsa in the
radial direction,

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.090
and we're going to count for the
rays, at least in a crude way.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.174
And then when you load them
balsa in the axial direction,

00:28:58.174 --> 00:29:00.090
initially you don't
really see much happening.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.480
So if one is unloaded,
one's down here.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.010
And two is at this
peak stress up here.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.130
And really, if you look
between one and two,

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.700
you just don't see an
awful lot of difference.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.283
And that's because what you're
doing is you're taking the wood

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:12.910
and you're loading
it this way on.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.410
And it's so stiff, you just
don't see much deformation.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.080
So there's not
really much to see.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.890
But then eventually,
something starts to fail.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.110
And in this case, what
fails are the end caps.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.485
So the balsa wood has
these long cells here.

00:29:24.485 --> 00:29:25.860
But then at the
end of the cells,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.750
there's little caps on the ends.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.770
And the cells kind of
fit together like that.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.130
So that eventually, if
you keep smushing it,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.670
those end caps start to fail.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.220
Here you can see
how bright it gets,

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.430
and the cells are starting to
crush together and kind of fail

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:42.372
those end caps.

00:29:42.372 --> 00:29:44.330
And in fact, each one of
these serrations here,

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.130
if you look at,
say, from that peak

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.640
up to that peak,
that corresponds

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.370
to a length of about
the length of the cell,

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.260
or the length of the cell
between the end caps.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.600
So in axial
deformation you're just

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.350
actually deforming the cells
until you break those end caps.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.940
If you look at
denser words, they

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.340
fail in slightly different ways.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.150
This is a Douglas fir,
which is much denser.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.100
This particular
specimen, the whole thing

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.590
is kind of buckled over.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.210
So it's not really
so representative

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.870
of the structure itself.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.986
This is Douglas fir
in radial compression.

00:30:17.986 --> 00:30:19.610
You can see this
picture, it looks just

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.776
like what I showed you for
the balsa wood, that sort

00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:24.455
of propagation of the failure.

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:27.380
These long things
here are the rays.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.930
And this is a Norway spruce
in axial compression.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.280
And this is fairly
common in denser words.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.640
You get this buckling formation.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.310
And what happens
is, I think, you

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.420
get some yielding of the
cell walls initially,

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.000
but that leads to buckling,
like a plastic buckling.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.390
And you can see on this
higher mag picture down here,

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.500
you get these really
small wavelength buckles

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.570
in the cell wall.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.860
And the two-- you
get a plane that kind

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.990
of shears over itself.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:55.970
And you can see
in the top image,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.960
this top half has shared over
relative to the bottom half.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.400
And all the deformation is
in this little band here.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:08.680
So this stuff here is all
going on in that band up there.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.130
So let me write down
some notes about how

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.160
these things to form and fail.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.957
And then we'll get to the
modeling in little bit.

00:31:17.957 --> 00:31:19.540
So we can say the
stress-strain curves

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.955
resemble those for honeycombs.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.240
And I'll say the mechanisms
of deformation and failure

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.970
are most easily identified
in low density balsa wood.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.730
So for balsa, if we look
at the tangential loading,

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.728
we see bending of the cell walls
and then eventually plastic

00:32:20.728 --> 00:32:21.228
yielding.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.885
And for radial loading, the
rays act as reinforcing.

00:33:36.008 --> 00:33:40.510
And for axial loading, you
get axial deformation and then

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.950
the failure of the end caps.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.290
And I'll just say failure
by plastic buckling

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.740
is also observed, say,
in the denser woods.

00:35:20.641 --> 00:35:21.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.790
So then we can look at some data
for the properties of woods.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.080
And these charts plot relative
Young's modulus and relative

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.334
strength against
relative density.

00:35:40.334 --> 00:35:41.750
So here the modulus
of the wood is

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.640
divided by the modulus of
the solid cell wall material.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.800
And here we've
normalized everything

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.780
by the modulus of
the solid cell wall

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.100
material in the axial
direction, because the cell

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.190
wall itself is anisotropic.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.867
And so here's the
relative modulus,

00:35:55.867 --> 00:35:57.200
and here's the relative density.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.010
These are log-log plots.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.890
And we see that when we load
the wood in the axial direction,

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.600
the moduli is just linearly
related to the density.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.620
And when we load it
across the grain,

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.012
it varies with the cube
of the relative density.

00:36:10.012 --> 00:36:11.970
So do you remember our
little honeycomb models?

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.011
If I took the honeycomb
and I loaded it this way,

00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:18.040
it went as the cube of T over L.
And that's because the bending.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.270
And so the wood doesn't lie
perfectly on that cube line,

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.927
but it's fairly close.

00:36:22.927 --> 00:36:24.760
And then similarly, if
we took the honeycomb

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.320
and we loaded it this way
on, it deformed axially.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.290
The modulus depended
linearly on the density.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.010
So you get the same kind
of relationships there.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.270
And then if you look
at the strength,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.780
the strength along the
grain goes linearly,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.870
and the strength across the
grain goes with the square.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.290
And we'll see when we get
to the modeling in a minute,

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.130
that if we loaded, say, an
aluminum honeycomb this way on,

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.180
the strength would go
linearly with the density,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.210
if we're just yielding
the cell walls.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.780
And if we loaded it this way
on, it went as the square of T

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.302
over L. So these things
kind of correspond.

00:36:59.302 --> 00:37:01.010
And you can see the
structure of the wood

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.280
is a lot more complicated
than just a simple honeycomb.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.630
And so these models are
sort of first order,

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.700
and they're fairly crude.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.950
They don't try to capture every
detail of the wood structure.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.100
But they can give you a sense
of where the wood properties are

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.500
coming from.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.090
So let me just write down
some of these observations.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:34.000
So the data for the wood--
the modulus along the grain

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.570
goes linearly with density.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.480
It goes more or less
as the cube for loading

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.880
in the tangential direction.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.550
And the radial direction is
somewhat stiffer different

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:56.050
than that.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.390
The strength in
the axial direction

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.880
goes linearly with the density.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.940
And the strength
across the grain

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.440
goes with the square
of the density.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:35.569
And then there's data for
the Poisson's ratios too.

00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:36.860
So let me just write them down.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.090
So the modeling based
on the honeycomb

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:49.410
is sort of a
simplified model that

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.300
gives you kind of a first-order
description of the behavior.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.560
And it doesn't really
attempt to capture

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.250
all the details of the softwood
and hardwood structure.

00:40:24.152 --> 00:40:26.360
And in the equations, I'm
going to take the cell wall

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.728
properties along the grain,
or along the axial direction.

00:40:38.224 --> 00:40:40.640
And we're going to have a bunch
of constants that describe

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.100
the cell geometry,
and those constants

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:48.590
are also going to reflect
the cell wall anisotropy.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.954
So we can model
the wood structure

00:42:10.954 --> 00:42:13.370
as something that's a bit more
of a simplified thing, just

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.240
like this.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.980
And we say we've got cells
that are roughly hexagonal,

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.890
and then we've got
some cells that

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.715
are more or less rectangular
that are the ray cells.

00:42:21.715 --> 00:42:23.340
And if you look at
lots of micrographs,

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.150
you can get some idea what the
dimensions of the cells are.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.570
And these dimensions
were measured

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.125
for a particular
density of balsa wood.

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.150
So if we look at the
linear elastic moduli,

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.085
we can start off with
a tangential loading.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.120
And if we have the
tangential loading,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.440
we can model it as a
honeycomb loaded in the plane,

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.653
and we get cell wall bending.

00:43:27.025 --> 00:43:29.380
And from the cell wall bending
in the honeycomb model,

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.470
you would get that the
tangential modulus varies

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.120
with the relative density cubed.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.210
And the structure's
not quite that simple.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.260
There's ray cells.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.180
There's end caps.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.040
And they act to stiffen
it a little bit.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.055
And the data lie a little
bit above this line.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.650
Then if we look at
the radial loading,

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.450
the rays kind of line up
with the radial direction,

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.125
and the rays act as
reinforcing plates.

00:44:28.125 --> 00:44:31.690
And so you can just use kind of
an upper-bound composites idea

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.520
to get the modulus.

00:44:46.356 --> 00:44:48.564
And the rays tend to be a
bit denser than the fibers.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:06.170
So if I say a Vr is the
volume fraction of rays,

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.550
and R is the ratio of
the relative density

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.210
of the rays compared
to the fibers,

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:17.680
so it's rho over rho S for the
rays divided by rho over rho

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.270
S for the fibers.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:26.690
And that varies a little
bit from what one species

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.190
to another, one
specimen to another.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.750
But it's something a little over
1, something between 1 and 2.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:36.010
Then I can say the modulus
in the radial direction

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.230
is the volume fraction
of the rays times

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:44.760
R cubed times the
tangential modulus plus 1

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.270
minus the volume
fraction of rays

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.520
times the tangential modulus.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.490
And that works out
to be about 1.5

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.010
times the tangential modulus.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.510
I wanted to work
this out in terms

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.510
of the tangential
modululs, so I've

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:01.900
put this in terms of
the tangential modules

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.900
in the first term there.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.150
So we get that
the radial modulus

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.460
is slightly larger
than the tangential,

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.660
but also goes roughly as
the cube of the density.

00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:41.420
And then for the
axial loading, we just

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.900
have axial deformation
in the cell wall.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.407
And the Young's modulus
just varies linearly

00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:47.115
with the density.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.950
So these are kind
of simple models,

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.290
but they kind of
explain to first order

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:16.660
the density dependence of the
wood moduli and the anisotropy.

00:47:41.274 --> 00:47:43.690
So it's kind of nice because
they're fairly simple models,

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.520
and it gives you kind
of a big picture.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.120
So if you wanted to know the
modulus of a particular piece

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.050
of wood, this probably isn't
the best way to figure it out.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:52.920
But if you wanted
to kind of compare

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.130
how do woods behave in general
and how does the density affect

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.020
the properties and why
are they anisotropic,

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.710
this is a pretty
good way to do it.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.310
We could also look at
the Poisson's ratios.

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.643
And just because I didn't
want to write them down again,

00:48:53.643 --> 00:48:56.120
I've just left on what
the data were down here.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:00.250
But let me just write what
the model would give us

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:05.760
for nu RT and nu TR, the
model would give us one

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.410
if we had regular
hexagonal cells.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.240
And these are the
values we get here.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.970
This might be 0.6, 0.7 would
be a typical value, somewhere

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.160
around 0.4 in there, so
they're not quite one,

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.930
but they're close to it.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:20.870
And I think the reason
they're a little less

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.540
is because the rays in the end
caps provide some constraint.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.460
If you have the honeycomb,
if I just had these cells,

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.050
and I squeeze it like this,
these guys can move out.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.120
If it's a regular
hexagonal honeycomb,

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.590
the strain that
I'm applying here

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.900
is equal to the strain
going out that way.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.080
But if I have rays this way
that sort of constrain it or end

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.490
caps, it means that
the Poisson's ratio is

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.010
going to be a little bit less.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.010
So I'll just say constraining
effect of the end caps

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.105
and rays-- constraining.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:09.080
Then for nu RA and
nu TA, the model

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.852
says the value we would
get would be zero.

00:50:12.852 --> 00:50:14.310
And these are pretty
close to zero.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:17.690
They're not quite
zero, but pretty close.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:25.680
And then the last
pair nu AR and nu AT,

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.842
the model says that we
would get nu of the solid.

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:38.880
And the data's close to
0.4, which we might expect

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.635
would be about the
nu of the solid.

00:50:40.635 --> 00:50:42.010
So, again, there's
some variation

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.010
in the Poisson's ratios.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:44.860
They're not all just one number.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:49.100
But you can see these
ones here are about zero,

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.380
and that's roughly
what the model says.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.890
These ones here are closer to 1.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.440
And then these ones
here are closer

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.500
to what you might expect
for a solid material.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.210
So it gives you the
kind of general idea.

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.798
Are we good?

00:51:02.798 --> 00:51:03.506
We're good, yeah?

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.332
So we can do a similar thing
for the compressive strength.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:27.600
So for tangential loading,
we get plastic hinges forming

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:37.970
and the bent cell walls, just
like in an aluminum honeycomb.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:52.370
Then we get that the strength
over the cell wall strength

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.500
goes as the relative
density squared,

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.470
so just like the honeycomb.

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.890
the radial loading, we can do
the composites thing again.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.570
So we can say the strengths
in the radial direction

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.780
is about equal to the
volume fraction of rays

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:17.860
times R squared times the
tangential strength plus 1

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.440
minus the volume
fraction of rays

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.790
times the tangential strength.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:26.870
And for balsa, I have
some values here.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.070
VR is about equal to 0.14.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:33.520
R is about equal to 2.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.810
And so the radial strength
is about equal to 1.4

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:40.970
times the tangential.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.380
And in higher density
woods, the value of R

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.480
is a little bit smaller, and
in general, the radial strength

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.750
is a bit larger
than the tangential,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:53:20.700
and both depend on
the density squared

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.240
And then for axial
loading, if the failure's

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.340
initiated by yielding
in the cell walls,

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.580
then the axial strength's
just going to depend linearly

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:31.667
on the density.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:59.470
So the idea with
these models isn't

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:05.460
that they kind of describe
a particular piece of wood

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.070
exactly.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.740
It's more that it gives you
a general picture of how

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.270
the cells are
deforming and failing,

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.459
and how the properties
scale with density

00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:14.750
and why the wood's anisotropic.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.480
Are we good?

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.170
Yeah?

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.632
Caught up.

00:54:52.632 --> 00:54:54.840
So there are a couple more
sort of interesting things

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.384
we can do with looking
at the wood properties.

00:54:58.384 --> 00:55:00.050
So we've been talking
about how to model

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:01.644
the cellular structure.

00:55:01.644 --> 00:55:03.810
But people have also looked
at how to model the cell

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.820
wall as a fiber composite.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.120
And this plot and the
next one kind of show you

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.300
how you can combine
all of that together.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.770
So remember, I said the
modulus of the cellulose

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.610
was around 140 gigapascals.

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:19.246
So here's the modulus of
the cellulose, at least

00:55:19.246 --> 00:55:21.120
the crystalline part of
the cellulose plotted

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.850
in that little envelope there.

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:26.620
The lignin and the hemicellulose
have a modulus around 2 or 3

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.740
gigapascals, so it's down there.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.750
And if you made composites
with cellulose fibers

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.150
in lignin and
hemicellulose matrix,

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:36.710
those composites would
have a modulus that

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:38.290
fell in this envelope here.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.681
They've got to be in between
those two limits, right?

00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:42.680
The modulus have to be
between those two limits.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.290
The density have to be
within the densities

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:47.610
of the constituents.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.870
And if you look at the
modulus of the wood cell wall,

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:51.780
it lies in this envelope here.

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.240
Along the grain it'd be here,
and then across the grain

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.710
is further down here.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.552
So the cell wall
modulus is in here.

00:55:58.552 --> 00:56:00.010
And then if you
take that cell wall

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:02.230
and you make it into the
honeycomb-type material

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:05.490
that wood is, if you
load it along the grain,

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:09.110
you're going to get this
linear dependence of modulus

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:09.700
on density.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.210
And if you load it
across the grain

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.390
in the radial or the
tangential direction,

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.920
you're going to get this
cubed dependence here.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.240
So here's a set of data
for different woods

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.670
of different densities.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.410
And that envelope kind of
encompasses all of them.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.580
But if you look at the
slope of that data,

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.510
it's roughly equal
to a slope of 1.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:32.100
And so it corresponds
to that equation there.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.100
And similarly,
here's a set of data

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.640
for different species of woods
of different densities loaded

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.440
perpendicular to the grain.

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.410
And they lie on a line that
has more or less a slope of 3.

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:46.070
And this set of data
here along the grain

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:48.700
intersects the wood cell
wall towards the top

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.570
of that envelope,
and this set of data

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:54.280
here intersects closer to
the bottom of that envelope

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.770
for the cell wall material.

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:58.353
So this gives you a way of sort
of putting everything together

00:56:58.353 --> 00:57:01.190
on one plot-- the cell wall as
well as the cellular structure.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:03.380
So that plot does
it for the modulus.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.050
And you can do the same kind
of thing for the strength.

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:07.710
Here's the cellulose up here.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.350
Here's the lignin down there.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:12.860
Here's the wood cell wall, the
composite made from those two.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.860
And then here's data
for different kinds

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:19.000
of woods loaded along the grain
and for load across the grain.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.220
So it gives you a way of
putting all this modeling

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.734
into one set of plots.

00:57:24.734 --> 00:57:27.150
So let me just write a couple
of little things about that.

00:57:48.427 --> 00:57:50.760
So we could say you could
model the cell wall as a fiber

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:51.260
composite.

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:10.260
And you can use the composition
upper and lower bounds

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.103
to give an envelope.

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:38.880
And then you can also show
the cellular solids models

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.825
on the same plot.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.130
So overall, it shows you how
the hierarchical structure fits

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:56.990
together and can be modeled.

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.136
Now there's some more
cute things we can see.

00:59:54.749 --> 00:59:56.290
So another thing I
want to talk about

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.200
is material selection,
because it turns out

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.620
wood is very good compared
to other materials

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.027
in certain applications.

01:00:02.027 --> 01:00:03.610
So we're going to
look at, say, having

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:06.340
a beam of a given
stiffness at a given span,

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.410
and say it's just a
square cross-section beam

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.660
of edge length T.
And the question

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:15.010
is, what material would
minimize the mass of the beam?

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.310
So say we have some
span we have to have.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:20.550
It's got to have some
rectangular cross-section,

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.964
some given stiffness.

01:00:21.964 --> 01:00:23.630
And the question is,
what's the material

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.900
that minimizes the mass?

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.730
So there's a little
short calculation

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:28.216
we can do to figure that out.

01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:29.840
And then I've got
another plot, and you

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.500
can compare different
materials on this other plot.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.060
Then you'll see how good wood
is compared to other materials.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:53.150
So from beam of a given
stiffness and given span,

01:00:53.150 --> 01:01:05.470
and say it's a
square cross-section,

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:07.020
then the question
is, what material

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.680
minimizes the mass of the beam?

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.260
So the mass is just
going to be the density

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.900
times t squared
times l And if it's

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.650
a beam, say it's got
some central load on it,

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.890
a concentrated load,
the deflection's going

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:44.820
to go as pl cubed
divided by some constant

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.940
and divided by the Young's
modulus and the moment

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.520
of inertia I.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.210
So the stiffness, if I just
rearrange this, the stiffness,

01:01:53.210 --> 01:02:00.304
p over delta, that's going
to go as p over delta CEI,

01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:06.500
and I's going to go as t
to the fourth over l cubed.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.360
And then I can solve
that for t squared.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.610
And I want t squared because
I'm going to plug it back

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:12.830
into the equation for the mass.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.870
So if I solve this
for t squared,

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:18.670
I've got my stiffness
p over delta.

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:23.440
I've got l cubed divided by CE.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.920
And then I take that whole thing
to the 1/2 power like that.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.350
And then I plug
the t squared back

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.150
into the little
equation for the mass.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:42.910
So I've got density minus p over
delta times l cubed over CE.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:46.770
And we'll take that whole thing
to the 1/2 power-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:48.450
another l.

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.370
And so to minimize
the mass, you want

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.306
to look at the
material properties.

01:02:52.306 --> 01:02:53.680
And here, the
material properties

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.530
are the density and
the Young's modulus.

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.370
And to minimize the mass,
you want to minimize rho

01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:00.850
over E the 1/2 power.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:18.676
Or conversely, you want to
maximize E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:28.610
So if you just had a bar that
you were just pulling on,

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:30.410
you would just want to
maximize E over rho.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:32.240
But if it's a beam
and bending, it

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.940
works out that you want to
maximize E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.820
And if we look at the next
slide, this next slide then

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:44.280
plots on a log-log scale,
it plots the modulus

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.240
on this axis and the
density on that axis.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.030
And here this plotted data for
lots of different materials.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.850
So there's engineering alloys.

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:55.370
Metals are up here.

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:57.320
Engineering ceramics are here.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.100
Composites are here.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.660
Polymers are down here.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.600
Elastomer is way down here.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.370
Foamy things, down here.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.720
And this envelope here is woods.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.140
And notice log scale here.

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:14.140
The lowest stiffness polymer
foams here are 0.1 gigapascal,

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.840
and diamond is up here
at 1,000 gigapascal.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.570
So there's like five orders
of magnitude difference

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:22.000
in the modulus here.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.470
So then, if you look at the
bottom right corner here,

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.350
there's a bunch of
old dashed lines.

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:29.030
And this red one here is
E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:31.190
So if it's log-log plot,
E to the 1/2 over rho's

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:33.380
going to show up
as a straight line.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.610
And every point on that
line has the same value of E

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:39.050
to the 1/2 over rho.

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:43.740
And the material that would be
the best for a beam of a given

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.470
stiffness would be the one
that has the biggest value of E

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:47.950
to the 1/2 over rho.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.270
And if I move the line
up to the top left here,

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.390
I'm increasing E.
I'm decreasing rho.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.980
It's got the biggest value
of E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.620
So the materials that
are on this line here,

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.930
they all have the same value
of E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:03.055
And they've got the biggest
value-- well, virtually

01:05:03.055 --> 01:05:04.121
the biggest value.

01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:05.870
So let's look at what
those materials are.

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:07.896
There's things like
engineering ceramics,

01:05:07.896 --> 01:05:10.270
like diamond that maybe are
not the most convenient thing

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:11.830
to make our beam
out of, and tend

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.100
to be brittle and might break.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.050
So we have some issues.

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.120
There's engineering composite,
so things like carbon fiber

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.660
reinforced plastics.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.770
And at this sort of
tip of the composites,

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:25.270
there'd be things like
unidirectional fiber

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.170
composites.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.130
And then here's other
woods down here.

01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:31.380
So the woods have the
same performance index,

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.920
this is called,
the same value of E

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.470
to the 1/2 over rho as the
best engineering composites.

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.825
And so they have very good
properties for their weight.

01:05:39.825 --> 01:05:41.200
And one of the
interesting things

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.270
is if you look at this
performance index of E

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:49.460
to the 1/2 over rho, this is the
performance index for the wood.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.610
This is for the solid
cell wall material

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:55.460
that the wood's made from,
so E to the 1/2 of the solid

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.080
over rho for the solid.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.910
And from the
modeling of the wood,

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:01.950
just looking at
the axial modulus,

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:05.482
this thing here is equal to
that times rho S over rho.

01:06:05.482 --> 01:06:07.690
So if you look at this, this
is the performance index

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.630
for the wood.

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:10.380
This is the solid
it's made from.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.152
This number here is
bigger than 1, right?

01:06:12.152 --> 01:06:13.610
Because the density
of the solid is

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:15.206
bigger than the
density of the wood,

01:06:15.206 --> 01:06:16.580
and so this is
saying the wood is

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.204
more efficient than
the thing that it's

01:06:18.204 --> 01:06:20.700
made from, than the solid
that it's made from.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.770
And so that's the sort of
plot for the stiffness.

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.720
And there's a similar
plot for the strength.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.150
That if you do the same
little kind of calculation,

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.730
you find that the performance
index for the strength

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:34.490
is some failure strength raised
to the 2/3 power over a rho.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.220
And again, here we're plotting
strength versus density

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.770
on a log-log plot.

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:43.140
And this red line here is the
strength of the 2/3 over rho.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.610
And again, if we scoot over
here so we have a parallel line,

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:51.230
every point on that line has
the same value of the strength

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.330
to the 2/3 power
over the density.

01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:55.980
And these are the materials
that have the highest values.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.470
And again, here's
engineering composites.

01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:59.380
These are ceramics.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.774
But the ceramics, they have
a high compressive strength,

01:07:01.774 --> 01:07:02.940
but they tend to be brittle.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.820
So it's not really a
practical strength.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.100
These are metals in here.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.392
And here's the woods down here.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:10.641
So it's kind interesting
just to see that the wood has

01:07:10.641 --> 01:07:11.710
such a good property.

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.590
Yes?

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:18.765
STUDENT: So I realize why
this is valuable setting up

01:07:18.765 --> 01:07:19.640
the problem this way.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:23.220
But if you're actually trying
to design something, why would

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.260
you want to fix
your cross-section?

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:29.340
You could change your material
and change your cross-section.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.990
LORNA GIBSON: So this
is the starter version

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.980
of this problem.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.270
And there's another
part two of the problem

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:36.590
is to change the shape.

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.530
And you could look at
what shape's efficient.

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:40.363
There's something called
a shape factor that

01:07:40.363 --> 01:07:41.740
gives you the efficient shapes.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.630
So you could take the
material and turn it

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:45.430
into a different shape and
have a more efficient thing

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:46.940
because it was a
different shape.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.890
So you can account for that.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:50.603
STUDENT: So then
if you varied, like

01:07:50.603 --> 01:07:52.580
let's say you made your
cross-section smaller,

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.310
like even if it
was still square,

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:56.150
you could just still
make it smaller.

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.340
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.190
I'm saying we've got
a given stiffness.

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:01.410
So if we're given a certain
stiffness and a certain span,

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.072
we would need a
certain cross-section

01:08:03.072 --> 01:08:04.113
to get to that stiffness.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.830
Are we happy?

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:11.220
OK.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.310
So that's one thing.

01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:14.146
Let's see here.

01:08:14.146 --> 01:08:16.479
So let me just write a few
more notes about the material

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.630
selection, and then there's
one more thing I wanted

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.796
to show you about the woods.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.830
Hmm?

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:26.620
C is just a constant.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.930
So it's just a number.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:31.359
So if you had a beam
in three-point bending,

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.470
then C would be three.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:33.960
If you had a beam
that was simply

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.069
supported with a central
load, C would be 48.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:37.910
C is just a number.

01:08:42.217 --> 01:08:43.342
STUDENT: One more question.

01:08:43.342 --> 01:08:47.772
So follow your line
there, and the choice

01:08:47.772 --> 01:08:51.577
is really just about cost.

01:08:51.577 --> 01:08:53.160
LORNA GIBSON: No,
it's not about cost.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.059
There's nothing on cost here.

01:08:55.059 --> 01:08:56.600
It's all really
about the properties.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.529
What's the best
combination of properties

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:00.930
to minimize the mass, and
then which material has

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:02.380
that combination of properties.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:06.140
You can do charts like
this that include cost.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.670
You can make these charts
with whatever property.

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:11.089
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:11.089 --> 01:09:18.760
I guess maybe there's a
difference off two or so

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.890
of strength.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:24.029
LORNA GIBSON: Between
pine and balsa?

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:25.390
Yeah, maybe more than that.

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.200
I think-- I can't quite see
where-- pine's close to 100,

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.514
and balsa's, I don't
know, 20 or something.

01:09:30.514 --> 01:09:33.063
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:33.063 --> 01:09:35.229
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, and
it's not-- the point of this

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:38.310
isn't so much looking at the
absolute value of a strength.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:42.050
It's looking at the value
of this performance index.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:45.210
And what you want to do
is maximize that index

01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:49.080
to get the material that's
going to minimize the mass.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.540
So let me just read a
couple notes about this.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.790
So we have these-- these are
called material selection

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.290
charts.

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:08.760
So you plot the log of one
property versus the log

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.397
of some other property.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:21.458
And then we have a line of
constant E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:23.457
I'll just say it's shown
in red because you're

01:10:23.457 --> 01:10:24.540
going have the same plots.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.620
And the materials with
the largest values

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.670
are in the upper left.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.160
So the woods have similar values
to engineering composites.

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:07.798
And you can do a similar
thing for strength.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.365
So I have a few more minutes.

01:11:36.194 --> 01:11:38.610
So I have a few minutes, and
I want to talk about a couple

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.380
of uses of woods.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.997
So one is in old ships.

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:44.080
So I don't know if you
know Professor Lechtman has

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.570
this course Materials
and the Human Experience,

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:49.170
and they talk about sort of
ancient uses of materials.

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:52.010
And I did a section,
a module, on woods

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.170
and the use of woods
in old colonial ships,

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:56.440
like The Constitution
that's in Boston Harbor.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.530
So this is kind of a
schematic of an old ship.

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.030
And the thing that
was interesting

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:03.840
and the thing I talked
about in this module

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.170
was that people chose particular
species for particular parts

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:07.720
of the boat.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.240
And they would choose
a particular species

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.070
depending on its properties.

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:14.160
And a lot of the
hull was made of oak.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.600
So oak's a very dense wood.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.870
But they would get something
they called straight oak,

01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:21.097
and they would get something
they called compass oak.

01:12:21.097 --> 01:12:22.930
And you can see this
little thing down here,

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:25.840
this little kind of schematic
here, this little sketch.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.280
This is straight oak,
just a straight trunk.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.445
And this thing here
would be the compass oak.

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:32.820
And what they would do is they
would use the straight oak

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.260
for straight parts of
the boat, so something

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.826
like this, these pieces here.

01:12:36.826 --> 01:12:38.200
And then they
would actually look

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:41.310
for trees that had the
curve of the branches

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:44.130
to match some part of the boat
that they were looking for.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.690
So, for instance, if you have
the hull out here and the deck

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:49.240
here and they had
their cannons here,

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.460
there's something
called a knee, which

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.120
is sort of a bracing
piece that goes

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.150
between the deck and the hull.

01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:55.900
And that bracing
piece is curved.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.770
And they would
actually look for trees

01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:01.520
in which the branches curved
at the same kind of curvature

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.281
as they were looking
for in that piece.

01:13:03.281 --> 01:13:05.030
And then they would
use it for that piece.

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.821
And the advantage of
this is they basically

01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:09.280
had the grain running
along the curve,

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.890
and so they got the best
properties out of the wood

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:12.910
by doing that.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.110
So they had this straight
oak and compass oak,

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:16.970
and that was one cute thing.

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:18.867
And often they used white oaks.

01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:20.450
And I brought a piece
of white oak in.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:22.200
You can see how dense it is.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.360
And the US Navy often used
something called live oak.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.700
Live Oak grows in the South.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.810
Anybody from the South?

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:30.870
You see these big
trees with huge sort

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:31.900
of spreading branches.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.900
Those are the live oaks.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.010
And apparently, the US
Navy, I read somewhere,

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.970
still has a forest
somewhere with live oak

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.390
for doing things like
repairing The Constitution.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:42.250
So let me just pass
those guys around.

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.760
So those are a couple of oaks
they would use for the hull.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.621
Then they would use
white pine for the masts.

01:13:47.621 --> 01:13:49.620
And the reason they used
white pine for the mast

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.953
is because the white pine
grows very, very tall and very

01:13:51.953 --> 01:13:52.840
straight.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.280
And white pine was actually
like a strategic resource

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.640
in the 1600s, the 1700s.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.990
And it turns out that when the
British Royal Navy was doing

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:06.190
all that colonial stuff
in the 1600 and 1700s,

01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:09.230
Britain actually ran out of
trees for masts for boats,

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:12.780
and they would actually
import masts from New England.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.170
And there were these
people called surveyors

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.010
who would go around
and they would

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:17.551
mark certain trees
that were supposed

01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:20.560
to be saved for these masts
for the British Royal Navy.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.219
And the thing was that
the size of the boat

01:14:23.219 --> 01:14:25.510
and how many cannons you
could put on the boat depended

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:27.290
on how big the mast was.

01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:30.250
So the size of the boat
depended on the mast,

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:35.260
because the mast height
controlled how much sail area

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.190
you could get.

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.410
So the taller the mast, the
more sail/ the more sail,

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:39.243
the bigger the ship.

01:14:39.243 --> 01:14:41.000
The bigger the ship,
the more cannons.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.820
And so having these
tall Eastern white pines

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.396
was a sort of a
strategic resource.

01:14:45.396 --> 01:14:46.770
And I have a piece
of white pine.

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:50.096
Unfortunately, my
dog got to this one.

01:14:50.096 --> 01:14:50.720
And be careful.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.594
It's a bit splintery.

01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:53.880
But you can see it's a
lighter kind of wood.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.287
And if you go
around New England,

01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:57.370
if you go to the arboretum,
you can see white oak.

01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.470
You can see Eastern white pine.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.810
The other wood they
used is lignum vitae,

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:04.390
that first dense one
that I passed around.

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:07.160
And if you notice that lignum
vitae has kind of a waxy

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.230
feel to it.

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:11.610
And they used that in the block
and tackle, so like pulleys

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:12.690
and stuff like that.

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.920
And it was thought to
be self-lubricating

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.810
because of that kind
of waxy layer on it.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.184
And because it's very dense,
if you think of like a block

01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:22.430
and tackle and you've got like
a rope going over a pulley,

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:24.750
you've got a pressure from
everything sort of fitting

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.874
together and the bits
bearing against each other.

01:15:26.874 --> 01:15:29.540
And the fact that was very dense
made it very good for the block

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.600
and tackle.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.900
And so they used the
lignum vitae for that.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.564
And there's one other cute
story about lignum vitae.

01:15:36.564 --> 01:15:37.980
I don't know if
any of you've ever

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:40.610
read Dava Sobel's Longitude.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:41.510
Anybody read that?

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:43.870
I'm a sucker for those
history of science books.

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.057
So her book Longitude
is about the development

01:15:47.057 --> 01:15:48.640
of an instrument to
measure longitude.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.600
Originally, they could get
the latitude from the stars,

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.015
but they were really bad
at getting the longitude.

01:15:56.015 --> 01:15:58.140
And so boats would go off,
and they wouldn't really

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.330
be able to figure
out where they were,

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:03.240
until they had a method
to measure longitude.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.340
And there was some British
board of something or another.

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.800
They put forward a
prize for somebody

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.460
who could produce a way of
measuring longitude accurately.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.180
And there was a guy called John
Harrison, and he built a clock.

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.510
He built a very
accurate chronometer.

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:20.790
And if you knew when sunrise
was and sunset was, and you knew

01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:23.582
the time and where you left,
you could figure out where you--

01:16:23.582 --> 01:16:24.790
it's kind of like time zones.

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.910
You could figure out
where you are today.

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:29.750
And he built a chronometer, and
one version of his chronometer

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.530
used a lignum vitae
for the same reason,

01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:34.710
because it was very dense,
and it was very stable.

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.520
And the clock that he
eventually won the prize with

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.230
was in the 1700s, 1759.

01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:42.090
I think they went on
some trip with it.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:46.250
It was 81 days at sea, and it
lost five seconds over 81 days.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.200
So that's pretty impressive
for 250 years ago.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.139
So that was the lignum
vitae in the clock.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.180
I have one more picture,
and then I can finish up

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:53.930
the thing on wood.

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:55.450
And we'll start
the cork next time.

01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:57.540
So this is another
example of using wood.

01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.280
And this is sort of
a more modern use.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.060
So this bridge here is made
with a glue-laminated wood.

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.260
So this big beam
here, the big arch,

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.840
is made up of sections of
wood which are glued together.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:13.240
And you can glue the sections
in a curved shape if you want.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.887
They sort of have
molds to do that.

01:17:14.887 --> 01:17:16.720
And when they make this
glue-laminated wood,

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.940
they cut the defects out.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:20.620
So they cut knots
out, and they control

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:22.960
the pieces of each
laminate that they

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.360
use to get the best quality.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.860
And the glue-laminated
wood actually

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:29.540
has better properties
than just two-by-fours

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.350
or whatever you would
cut down, lumber

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:32.890
that you would cut from a tree.

01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:36.567
So glue-laminated wood is
kind of a nice kind of wood

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:37.650
structure that's used now.

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:41.250
And you see it all the time in
things like ice rink arenas,

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:42.300
like large spans.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.470
It's kind of beautiful.

01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:45.844
You can see the wood grain in
the curve in the wood grain

01:17:45.844 --> 01:17:47.130
when they make these things.

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:48.480
So that's the wood lecture.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.744
I'm going to stop there.

01:17:49.744 --> 01:17:51.160
So next time I'll
talk about cork.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.960
I just have a little
bit about cork.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.985
And then we'll start
talking about foams.

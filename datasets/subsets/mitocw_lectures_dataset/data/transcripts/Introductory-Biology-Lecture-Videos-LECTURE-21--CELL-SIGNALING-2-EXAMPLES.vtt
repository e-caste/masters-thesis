WEBVTT

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.110
PROFESSOR: OK, here we go.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.100
Couple of things.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.070
Sorry, I forgot to bring candy,
but it'll be on sale next week.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.070
So we can probably
bring it next week.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.380
But walking over, I thought,
boy, those of you who are here

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.470
deserve some candy.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.570
But I've just tried to sprinkle
in a few interesting slides

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.230
for your benefit.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380
I saw this on the
MIT news of the day,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.420
and I thought that
was really cool.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.960
Who would have thought to turn
the giant dome into a Halloween

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.890
pumpkin?

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.690
And I was also
jealous this morning

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.380
when my husband got ready to
go work in the emergency room

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.660
and he put on his
Star Trek outfit.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.780
So I was like, oh,
I didn't even have

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.850
a-- because I don't
usually get to actually

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.070
have a class on the
day of Halloween.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.230
So he headed off.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.850
I think people are
unfortunately going

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.849
to expect him to be able to
really fix things very readily

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.790
in the emergency room
today because he's

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.400
going to have all those extra
powers that he doesn't usually

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.630
have.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.720
But anyway, so
actually it's kind

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.320
of a good day for a
lecture, Halloween,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.400
because we're going to talk
about the fight or flight

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
response, which is
a great paradigm

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.590
for cellular signaling.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.240
So you're going to see
how signaling really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.980
works in action.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.470
Because what one
has to think about

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.690
with respect to
cellular signaling

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.920
is that it's dynamic
and transient.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.410
And when we look at
the molecular details

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.910
of the switches that enable
dynamics and transient behavior

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.060
in cells, you're going to
see how perfectly adapted

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.030
they are for these
types of responses that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.150
have to be carried out
in cells or in organs

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.080
in order to respond to a
particular signal rapidly

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.750
and with a definitive
time frame and then

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.750
have that signal then stop
once the time frame has passed.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.760
So I really want to
sort of stress to you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.050
the characteristics of
signaling that can emerge just

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.390
by knowing about two
particular cellular switches,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.300
knowing the molecular
details of those switches,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.840
to really understand, then,
when we look at them in action

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.600
in a couple of cellular
signaling pathways,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.570
then we'll see how
adapted those signals are.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.880
And the great
thing about biology

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.870
is that once you learn a
few very specific things,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.900
then those often get
reused in nature.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.870
So the cellular signals that
I'm going to describe to you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.810
are used again and again
in different formats

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.390
to create different
signaling pathways.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.520
So it's not at every pathway.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.610
And every cell in the body
has different nuances.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.020
It has general paradigms that we
can learn about and understand,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.680
all right?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.320
So the key feature is then to
think about the molecular basis

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.590
of these switches.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.940
So last time, I was talking to
you about cellular signaling.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:25.760
And remember, there's
always a signal, a response,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.350
and an output.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.440
So something happens.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.190
It's a signal.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.570
It's usually a molecule of
some kind outside the cell

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.150
or able to diffuse
into the cell.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.220
As a function of that
signal, there's a response.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.440
So this is molecular.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.390
The response obviously
is biochemical.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.650
And the output is biological.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.050
So I want you to sort
of think about these

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.090
as we look at pathways.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.220
What's really my
output at the end

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.230
of a particular
signaling pathway?

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.430
What was my input?

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.350
How did it get to the cell?

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.920
How does it have a dramatic
effect on the cell as a whole?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.250
How does the timing and
action of this effect

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.600
occur so rapidly?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.400
So we talked last time
about different types

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.160
of signals, those
that mostly occur

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.880
in the cytoplasm of the
cell with signals that

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.600
are able to diffuse across
the plasma membrane and bind

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.560
to an intracellular receptor
and then cause an action.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.560
But really, the most
important ones for today

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680
are going to be the
types of receptors

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.970
that span the membrane.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.040
And the reason why these
are much more significant,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.130
they're more in number,
they're more predominant,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.100
is if you have a membrane
spanning receptor,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.470
you have the opportunity
to use signals

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.570
of very, very different types.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.050
Small polar molecules, small
proteins, lipids, amino acids,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.220
carbohydrates.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.490
You've got a much
larger range of signals

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.940
than you could possibly have
if you restricted yourselves

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.360
to the type of signals that
can cross the cell membrane.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.470
Those are very limited to
non-polar small molecules that

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.190
can get across the membrane.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.670
The more dominant
types of signals

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.910
are going to be the ones
that are outside the cell.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.130
They arrive at a cell surface.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.860
They bind to a receptor that
is transmembrane and transduce

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.040
a signal from the
outside to the inside.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:56.000
So that's an
important term here,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.690
the process of transducing
external information

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.270
to internal information.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.440
So when we started
the course, we

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.570
were really thinking
about laying down

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.470
the cellular membrane as
an encased environment

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.500
where things could occur
at high concentrations.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.450
You could set up
systems that were

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.100
functional within membranes.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.060
But in doing that within
a membrane encased area,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.850
in doing that, you've
built a formidable barrier

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.150
around the cell.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.440
So the types of receptors
that we'll talk about

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.960
are those that have adapted to
take this external information

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.290
into the cell and then have
a cellular consequence occur.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.360
So I'm going to talk to you
about two specific types

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.330
of cellular
switches, and they're

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.950
going to be intracellular.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.110
And we're going to be referring
back to these because they're

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.680
going to be important as we
dissect a signaling pathway.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.240
So the first type-- so
stand aside a moment.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.210
Put aside a moment
the actual process

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.330
of a signal binding
the response,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.910
both biochemical and biological.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.520
Let's look first at
the molecular detail

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.680
of these switches
and see how they

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.060
are adapted to their function.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.210
And the first type
of cellular switch

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.965
are what are known
as G proteins.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.480
The G is because they bind
guanidine nucleotides.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.890
So that's why they're
called G proteins.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:46.560
They're small proteins
that bind GDP or GTP.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:56.340
So this is the
guanine nucleotide

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.590
that has either two phosphates,
guanidine diphosphate

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.820
or triphosphate.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.880
So there may or may not
be a third phosphate here.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.800
And the G proteins bind them.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.870
And the dynamics
of the situation

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:20.880
are that when the G
proteins are bound to GDP,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.380
they are inactive.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.690
The switch is off.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.760
There's an aspect
of the structure,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.330
and it's very dependent on
how many phosphates there

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.830
are in this structure.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.250
But it's when it's bound
to the diphosphate variant

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:44.130
of the nucleotide, then
it's an off switch.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:53.355
And when it's bound to GTP, it's
an on switch and it's active.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.970
So this is the molecular
basis of one of the switches.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.870
It relies on the shape,
the conformational dynamics

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.160
of these small G proteins.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.070
And that shape is
quite different

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.480
if it's bound to guanidine
diphosphate or triphosphate.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.980
And we'll take a
look in a moment

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.710
at how the structure,
the shape, changes.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.700
The shape shifts upon binding
the triphosphate analog.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.390
So this is a dynamic
interconversion.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.330
When the GTP is
hydrolyzed, you go back

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.420
to the GDP-bound
state, the off state.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.090
And there are a
variety of proteins

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.940
that actually help these
processes, which we

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.260
won't talk about in any detail.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.320
The main thing that
you want to remember

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.410
is that when the G
proteins are bound to GTP,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.700
they're in a non-state.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.940
GDP, they're in an off state.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.320
And that's shown
in this cartoon.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.610
And here I should be able to,
if all goes according to plan,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:10:00.100
show you the structure of a GTP
analog bound to a G protein.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.190
So lets-- this little
guy is twirling around.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.720
He's settled down a little bit.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.130
The key thing you
want to look at

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.520
is where it's magenta
and cyan, the structure

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.620
of the GDP and GTP-bound G
protein are very, very similar.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.720
But big changes
happen in the yellow,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.400
which is the GDP-bound
form, and the red,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.050
which is the GT-bound form.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.220
Let me go back again so you
can see that one more time.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:33.390
So in the GTP-bound form,
a portion of the protein

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:39.720
swings around and binds to
that third phosphate on the GTP

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.390
and forms a different
shape to the structure.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.280
And that's a dynamic
change that's

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.260
responsible for activation.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.200
When it's just GDP,
that's shorter.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.690
There's nothing for
that red arm to bind.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.300
And so it's much more
of a floppy structure.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.630
What I want you to notice in
that little yellow portion

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.530
in the GDP-bound
form, you actually

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.470
don't really see where the
rest of the protein is.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.160
This is because this
is a crystal structure.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.710
And in the crystal structure,
when things are very mobile,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.930
you can't even see
electron density.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.880
It's as if the
part of the protein

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.670
isn't there because
it is so dynamic.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.160
It's only in the
GTP-bound form it

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.650
forms this tight,
compact structure

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.080
that represents a switch
that has been turned on.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.185
Does that make
sense to everybody?

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:29.310
Is everyone good with that?

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.180
So just that change, that extra
phosphate reaching further

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.760
to the protein and
making an interaction

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.790
with the protein itself,
makes the difference

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.570
in the dynamics of the G
protein and the activity here.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:48.060
Now, there are different
types of G proteins.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.540
And you'll see both types
reflected in this lecture.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:12:02.550
There are small G proteins,
and they are monomeric.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.730
And then there are slightly
more complicated G proteins

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.930
that are trimeric.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.630
They have a
heterotrimeric, structure.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.880
So they have
quaternary structure

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.340
where you have three
different proteins

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.798
as part of the complex.

00:12:22.798 --> 00:12:24.090
So the other ones are trimeric.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:35.610
And the G protein actually
comprises three subunits

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.670
where one of them is
the important one that

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.610
binds GDP or GTP.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.650
But they are a little
bit more complicated.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.870
And in the first
example when I talk

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.180
about a particular
response to adrenaline,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.130
we're going to see the
trimeric G proteins.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.010
And because they're
trimeric, that

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.430
means there's three subunits.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.000
And the convention is that they
get the Greek lettering system.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.133
So they are the alpha,
beta, and gamma subunits.

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:07.300
They've each got their name.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.970
They're three independent
polypeptide chains.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:17.750
And it's actually the alpha
subunit that binds GDP or GTP.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.450
So that's the formulation of
one of the types of switches

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.550
that we're going to see when
we start to look at a pathway.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.290
What do you need
to remember here,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.230
you need to focus on the
fact that in one state,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.110
the protein is in an off state.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.700
It doesn't kick off
a signaling pathway.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.670
But in the other
state, the protein

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.550
is a different shape
because of binding a loop--

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.920
let's just make this
a little longer--

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.280
to that phosphate
that's negatively

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.210
charged to the protein.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.160
So that's an on state.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.270
And they are very definitive
types of structures.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:08.790
Now, both of these
proteins are intracellular,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.900
which means they're part of the
response once a signal reaches

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.680
a cell.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.180
They are things that change.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.040
And they're what the signal gets
transduced to, the G proteins.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.520
Now, there's another type
of intracellular switch

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.940
which is used very, very
frequently in nature.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.910
And in fact, it
crosses, permeates,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.210
through all kinds of
cellular processes.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.950
And this is phosphorylation.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.950
So here are the G
proteins, which is one.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.590
And the other one
is phosphorylation.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.135
I don't like that chalk.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.750
OK, now remember, we
talked about reactions

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.540
of proteins that
alter their behavior,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.700
their properties,
their dynamics.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.730
So protein
phosphorylation, remember,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.200
is a post-translational
modification, a PTM.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.510
It's something that
happens to a protein

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.200
after it has been
translated and folded.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.610
And the PTMs in
a phosphorylation

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:29.420
involve amino acids
that have OH groups.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.440
So that's the
structure of tyrosine

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.780
where the squiggles represent
the rest of the protein.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:53.120
And on phosphorylation, we
append a phosphate group--

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.140
whoops, a minus, a minus--

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.890
to the oxygen on tyrosine
on the side chain.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.900
So actually, it looks
pretty different.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.280
It behaves pretty differently.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.730
There are two other
residues in eukaryotic cells

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.060
that are commonly
phosphorylated.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.450
There are the other two
that include OH groups.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:31.180
So they are serine
and the third one--

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.760
as I run out of space, but
you get the general message--

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.300
and threonine.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.070
So these are the three
amino acids that commonly

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.320
get a phosphate group attached.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.600
And they change
their properties.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.080
They are called kinases.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.610
Kinase, the root of the word
is actually "to change."

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.140
So the enzymes that
catalyze this change

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.345
are known as kinases.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.780
And in contrast to the
G proteins that use GTP,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:12.010
the kinases most commonly use
ATP to give up a phosphate

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.900
to phosphorylate the protein.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.400
So there's another substrate
in this reaction is ATP.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.339
Now, when we look
at this structure,

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.839
there's two or three
things I really

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.760
want to call your attention to.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.890
If we're dealing with
this kind of switch,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.990
we can go back to the off
state by chopping up the GTP

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.550
and making it GDP again.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.250
So that's how to turn
the light back off.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.920
In the case of
the kinases, we've

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.030
got to do something to
go back from this state

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.900
to the non-modified state to
turn the light switch off.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.560
So for every transformation in
the cell that involves kinase,

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.230
there is a corresponding
set of enzymes

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.320
that reverse the reaction
called a phosphatase.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.270
It takes that group off again.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.660
So let me write that down here.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.370
Now, phosphate is used a lot.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.110
So this is a
phosphoprotein phosphatase.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.420
So kinase puts the phosphate on.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.780
The phosphoprotein phosphatase
takes the phosphate off.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.300
There are three
types of amino acids

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.170
that get most commonly
modified in our cells--

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.130
tyrosine, serine, and threonine.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.660
And one of the ones that
forms an important part

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.450
of an extracellular
signaling mechanism

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.850
are the tyrosine kinases.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:43.670
And we'll delve into them in a
little bit, not the section I'm

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.050
going to cover now, but later.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.400
Because tyrosine,
various kinases

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.810
come in a lot of
different flavors.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.490
The common flavors
are whether you

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.670
modify tyrosine or
threonine/serine,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.950
because these are more
similar to each other,

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.090
and this guy is different.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.200
But we'll get to that later.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:10.010
So in the cell, we
have about 20,000 genes

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:18.380
that encode proteins,
encoding genes.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.120
All right, 515 of
those are kinases.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.640
That's a pretty big chunk of
the genome you've got to accept.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:36.340
So in excess of 500 kinases.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.030
Specifically, protein
kinases, the ones that modify.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.270
So there's a big hunk
of the genome dedicated

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.280
to this kind of activity.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.640
And there's a dynamic
because there's also

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.975
about 100 phosphatases.

00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:52.600
They are a little
bit more promiscuous.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.610
You don't need so many of them.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.390
But a large sort of
component of the genome

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.590
is responsible for
phosphorylating proteins

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.380
and dephosphorylating
phosphoproteins.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.815
And that part of the genome
has its own special name.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.410
And it is called the kinome.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.460
I hope that's not
too small in there.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.480
So if we're describing
all the enzymes

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.360
in the genome that
catalyze phosphorylation,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.420
we would call it the
kinome as a collective set.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.370
Because it's the set of kinases.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.640
And you'll hear that
term quite commonly.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.650
And the kinome is
really important

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.130
and represents major,
major therapeutic targets.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.930
Because it's when
kinases go wrong

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.610
that we have
physiological defects.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.060
So let's just go back to this.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.050
You can see we've got the
kinase and the phosphatase.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.830
The donor for
phosphorylation is ATP.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.690
And it is the gamma
phosphate that's

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.930
transferred to the protein to
switch it from the off state

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.460
to the on state.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.280
It is a post-translational
modification,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.700
meaning it occurs on a
protein after the protein has

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.550
been fully translated.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.340
There are a few
cotranslational PTMs.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.530
That seems like a
bit of an oxymoron,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.050
cotranslational modifications.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.960
But phosphorylation
isn't one of them.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.050
Glycosylation is.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.480
And we won't go into
those in any detail

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.700
even though it breaks my
heart not to go into those.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:33.850
But OK, all right, so now I want
to first of all introduce you

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.420
to a paradigm for signaling
as opposed to really go

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.840
into what's happening.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.820
And so one of the
first paradigms

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.810
is a situation where
you have a cell.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.080
In the plasma membrane of
that cell is a receptor.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.000
And it gets hit with a signal.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.120
So a signaling paradigm
is that a molecule

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.920
from outside the cell binds to
something that's transmembrane.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.410
And then you start getting
signal transduction

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.670
through a pathway.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.177
So any extracellular signal
could be game in this process.

00:22:08.177 --> 00:22:09.760
And then there's a
sequence of events.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.460
Upon signal binding,
there's a sequence

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.660
of changes that ends you
up with a final output.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.790
And generally,
signaling pathways

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.830
go through a number
of steps where

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:25.190
there is the opportunity for
the amplification of a signal.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.610
So I talked to you
last about time

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.460
about some of the
hallmarks of signaling.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.130
Specificity defines how
accurately that extracellular

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.350
signal binds to the receptor.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.160
But amplification
really refers to how

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.160
signals get bigger and
bigger through certain steps

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.260
in a signaling pathway
in order to have

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.190
a big impact in the cell,
not just a single event going

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.210
through a single pathway
one molecule at a time.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.530
And we'll see that in the
example that I show you.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.120
And then oftentimes when we
look at signaling pathways,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.430
we care a great
deal about what's

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.490
the first response
upon the signal hitting

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.330
the outside of the cell.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.570
So in many signaling pathways,
this could be a protein.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:21.100
The receptor could be a protein
that is bound to a G protein.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.900
And that would be
the first responder

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.510
through the pathway
that really triggers off

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.250
the cellular events.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.520
OK, and now, so what I want
to talk about now, is the--

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.630
I always get this wrong.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:36.520
I always thought it was flight
or fight or fight or whatever,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.150
fright.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.420
I always thought it was flight
or fright, but it's not.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.690
The response is actually
the fight or flight.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.160
So let's set this
up to understand

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.190
why this is such a
great manifestation

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.340
of a cellular
signaling response.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.920
Because it includes a
lot of the hallmarks

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.740
that are really characteristic
of the cellular response.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:08.860
So this response involves
a cellular receptor

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:20.530
that is called a G
protein coupled receptor.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.110
We saw a little bit
about them last time.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:31.970
They are always called
GPCRs for short.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.240
And what that term
means is that it's

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.570
a receptor that is linked
in some way to a G protein.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:50.695
So it could be coupled to
a monomeric or a trimeric G

00:24:50.695 --> 00:24:51.195
protein.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.670
So don't confuse the two.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.260
One is the receptor.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.550
It's transmembrane.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:04.350
It's responsible for receiving
signals and transducing them.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.020
The first responder
is the G protein

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:12.120
that changes from a GDP-bound
stage to a GTP-bound state.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.400
And in the one that we're
going to talk about,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.620
we're going to deal with a
trimeric G protein in the fight

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.480
or flight response.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.820
And what you see
here is a cartoon

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.950
of the players
that are involved.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.560
So remember the G proteins?

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.930
We talked about them
briefly last time.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:36.210
They have seven
transmembrane helices.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.770
They span the membrane.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.510
They have the N
terminal outside.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:51.360
N terminus out, C terminus in.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.015
And each of these is
a transmembrane helix.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.960
And this would be
outside the cell.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.630
This would be in the cytoplasm.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.480
OK, and you can
actually often look

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.630
at the transmembrane protein
and know its behavior.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.200
Because the width of
these transmembrane

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:21.310
helices often comes in at
approximately 40 angstrom,

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.060
which is the span of a membrane.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.690
You can sort of say, that looks
like a transmembrane helix

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.500
because it's exactly that
dimension to cross a membrane.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.110
And the GPCRs in
this case would bind

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.100
to a ligand outside
the cell and have

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.660
a response inside the cell.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.110
So those seven
transmembrane helices

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.660
are responding to
ligand binding.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.160
So let's take a
look at this picture

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.702
because it's almost
impossible for me

00:26:49.702 --> 00:26:51.100
to get it onto the screen.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.610
So it binds to a
trimeric G protein.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.760
Remember, I talked to you
about the two different types.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.630
The trimeric has an alpha, beta,
and gamma subunit quaternary

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.790
structure.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.400
And they're shown here
in different colors.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.770
The green is the alpha subunit.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.350
The red is the gamma subunit.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.130
And the yellow is
the beta subunit.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:27.610
So what happens, when the ligand
binds the G protein coupled

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.760
receptor, there is a
reorganization of those seven

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.650
transmembrane helices.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.912
Last time, I
identified them to you.

00:27:34.912 --> 00:27:36.370
When you look at
a couple of these,

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.760
they're actually
fairly large loops

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.580
that grab onto your ligand.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.130
And then that will translate
conformational information

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.560
through the membrane
to the other side

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.240
where the G proteins
are sitting.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.120
And in this response,
what happens

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:58.300
is upon binding the ligand, the
alpha subunit leaves the team

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:04.180
and goes from their GDP-bound
state to the GT-bound state.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.610
So it literally
changes its state

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.770
and changes its
mode of association

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.420
within the cell
upon that action.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.310
So you can see how
nicely we have transduced

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.730
the ligand binding out here to a
pretty discrete cellular event,

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.618
turning on the switch of
the G protein alpha subunit.

00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:23.910
Is everyone following me there?

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.390
I know it sort of looks
complicated to start with.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.600
But you'll see it in action.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:36.290
OK, so here are the cellular
components of the response.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.650
So basically, this is
the kind of response

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:43.210
where if you get scared or
you feel you're in harm's way,

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.820
you will trigger this
response in order

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.040
to generate a lot of ATP in
order that you can respond--

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.480
run away, hide, do
something very active

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.780
in order to rapidly respond
to a threat of some kind.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.790
And this response is
triggered by a small molecule.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.720
In this case, it's
epinephrine or adrenaline.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.120
Different names on different
sides of the Atlantic,

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.040
but you all know
what adrenaline is.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.520
And here's the structure of
epinephrine or adrenaline.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:21.790
And it is the signal for
the flight or fight response

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.600
because it's the small molecule
that binds to the extracellular

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.930
surface of the receptor,
changes its shape

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.700
so that things can
happen intracellularly.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.120
And it's just one
small molecule.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.650
Normally that would be charged.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.940
It doesn't diffuse
across the membrane.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.140
So it's stuck being on the
outside of the membrane, OK?

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.230
So this is the signal that
triggers the response.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:49.330
So if you have to respond
to a threat of some,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.220
kind you can't stop, sort of go
to the fridge, get a big snack,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.310
eat it, digest all your
food, and hope you're

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.920
going to get energy quickly.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.820
What you've got to
do is have a response

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.300
where you can generate energy
from your glycogen stores that

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.440
are in the liver.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.240
So there is a signal comes
from the adrenal region, which

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.140
is the release of adrenaline
that goes to the cell surface

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.540
receptors to trigger
the response.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.470
And what kind of
signal would this be?

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.300
Would it be paracrine,
autocrine, exocrine?

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.540
What kind of signal
would that be?

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.910
Sorry-- endocrine,
paracrine, juxtacrine

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.160
Do you remember last time?

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.660
Yeah--

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.493
AUDIENCE: Endocrine.

00:30:31.493 --> 00:30:33.850
PROFESSOR: Endocrine,
so it's a response that

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.370
comes from the kidneys
and goes to the liver.

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.980
So it's going, it's traveling.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.020
Autocrine is self.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.570
Paracrine is near.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.320
Juxtacrine is cell contact.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.720
But any of these
hormonal responses

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.970
are pretty commonly
endocrine responses.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.320
So what happens once
the signal binds?

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.490
So the specificity in this
situation is that the G protein

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.600
coupled receptor-- now shown
in pink in very stylized form,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.290
but you can count those
seven transmembrane domains--

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:11.290
will bind exclusively to this
GPCR with high specificity.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.240
Another signal,
another small molecule

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.270
that looks like it won't
bind because we have to have

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.280
specificity for the signal.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.970
Upon that binding event,
it will trigger a change

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.320
within the cell.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.340
And that change within the cell
is that the alpha subunit--

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.900
here you see alpha
subunit, beta, gamma.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.740
They're all shown in green.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.550
The alpha subunit
of the G protein,

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.710
remember, I told you
it was a trimeric G

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.370
protein where the alpha
subunit is the key player.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:49.660
The alpha subunit leaves the
team and it exchanges its GDP--

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.430
that's its resting
state, nothing's

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.890
happening-- for GTP,
which turns it on.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.960
So that's the first response.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.230
The G protein is
responding to the signal

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.260
from the outside of the
cell through the auspices

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.480
of the G protein
coupled receptor

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.910
to give a change within the
cell that's a discrete change.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.000
OK, following me so far?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.150
So now what we need to do
is trigger the remaining

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.150
biochemical events that
are going to get us out

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.160
of this sticky
situation where we

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.660
need to produce a lot of ATP.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.190
So it turns out that
the GTP-bound form

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.480
of the alpha subunit can
then bind to another enzyme.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.170
And that enzyme is
adenylate cyclase.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:37.190
So we've bound, we've
changed the GDP to GTP,

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.760
there's a response,
and we activate

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.490
the enzyme known as AC,
which you look up here,

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.650
it's called adenylate cyclase.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.620
So this is a messenger
within the cell that's

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.290
now being generated
as a response

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.520
to the signal coming from
outside through the GPCR

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.320
to the alpha subunit
of the G protein,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.110
which, then, in its GTP-bound
state, binds adenylate cyclase.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.130
OK, is everyone with me?

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.360
And once that is bound,
adenylate cyclase

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.310
can do its biochemistry.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.070
And the biochemistry that
adenylate cyclase does

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.390
is shown down here.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.000
Here's ATP.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.380
Adenylate cyclase cyclizes ATP.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.450
You lose two of the
phosphates, and you

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.900
get this molecule known
as cyclic AMP, which

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.960
is a messenger molecule that
will propagate information

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.660
through the cell.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.050
So now, the adenylate
cyclase is activated

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.380
because it's bound
to the GTP-bound form

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.020
of the alpha subunit.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.650
That means we can make
a bunch of cyclic AMP.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.220
And cyclic AMP is what's
known as a second messenger.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.910
And that often means
it's a common messenger

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.170
in a lot of pathways.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.989
It shows up quite frequently
within the wiring of a pathway.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:14.659
And it acts locally to where
the pathway is being processed.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:21.429
So once cyclic AMP is
formed by adenylate cyclase,

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.040
that then activates an enzyme.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.849
It activates protein kinase
A. So PKA is a kinase.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.480
It's actually a serine
threonine kinase.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.900
And that then results
in certain proteins

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.710
within the cell becoming
phosphorylated to continue

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.639
propagating our effect.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:35:00.070
So we have specificity by
the adrenaline binding.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.670
We have amplification
somewhere in this pathway.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.870
So I told you that many pathways
go through steps where you

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.910
start amplifying the signal.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.070
Where do you think
is the first stage

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.050
in this set of
transformations that I've

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:19.250
described to you where you start
amplifying the information?

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:24.140
Think about what each
of the events comprises.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.540
Is this one binding
to one in one event,

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.960
or is it one binding to one
and we get multiple events?

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.950
Where is the first step of
amplification that's essential?

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.570
Because it wouldn't
do us any good

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:39.180
if we make one molecule of
ATP at the end of the day.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.320
We've got to make dozens and
dozens of molecules of ATP.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.920
What's the first event that
could be an amplification?

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.420
Over there--

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.785
AUDIENCE: Is it when [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:49.785 --> 00:35:52.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
when it's made, yes.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.110
So this, let's go through them.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.240
One binds to one, great.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.180
Once one binds to one,
one of these is released.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.280
It gets converted
to one of these.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.400
Once one of these is made,
adenylate cyclase is an enzyme,

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.120
so it can make a
bunch of cyclic AMP,

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.850
which can then activate
a bunch of protein kinase

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:15.110
A, which can then phosphorylate
a bunch of cellular proteins.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.535
So we've got an expansion
of our response.

00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:19.910
All right, so everyone, does
that make sense to everyone?

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.490
So amplification is
really important.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.010
Feedback is also important.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.730
If you ended up needing
an EpiPen because you

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.920
have an allergic
response, you might

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.050
remember that you've
got the jitters forever

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.080
because there's too much
firing and action going on.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.420
But in the fight
or flight response,

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.730
there's feedback at
a certain stage that

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.340
slows down this entire process.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.130
And that feedback actually
comes from an enzyme

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.490
that chomps up the
cyclic AMP to make it

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.590
inactive as a second messenger.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.950
So there's feedback
in this process.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:56.660
OK, now, what happens
within the cell

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.310
to get us that
biological response?

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.450
This is a sort of a shortened
version of what's happening.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.310
So epinephrine binds.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:08.690
Here we are with the alpha
subunit with cyclic AMP.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.700
For each one of
these, you might make

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.310
20 molecules of cyclic AMP.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.390
That would inactivate
many, many PKAs.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.570
And then you go through a
series of biochemical steps

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.420
where different
enzymes are activated

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:28.970
with the overall goal of in the
liver chewing up glycogen. OK,

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.960
so glycogen is a pretty
impenetrable polymer

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.730
of carbohydrates.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.500
And you need several enzymes
to start to break glycogen down

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.090
to make glucose phosphate.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:48.050
And so these enzymes here
of phosphorylase, B kinase,

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:52.820
glycogen phosphorylase all
end up converting glycogen

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.440
into glucose 1 phosphate.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.790
So you access your liver stores
of stored carbohydrate, which

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.650
is in a polymeric form, to get a
lot of glucose phosphate, which

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.280
is then hydrolyzed to glucose,
which then hits the blood

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.180
system.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.570
And then you can deliver
glucose to all the cells

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.570
to go glycolysis and make ATP.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.835
And every glucose
molecule, as you know,

00:38:16.835 --> 00:38:19.230
can really churn out ATP.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.380
So what we see in
this process is

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.500
going through the entire
dynamics of the system

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.760
where we've seen specificity,
amplification, and feedback.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.234
Later on, I'll describe
integration to you.

00:38:32.234 --> 00:38:34.730
OK, everyone following?

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.690
The series of steps that go
from a molecular messenger

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:42.320
to biochemical steps to
physiological, biological

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.790
response.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.970
Now, I want to just emphasize
one quick thing here.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:51.830
I've got a couple of slides
I popped in of drug targets.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.220
About 45% are
receptors in cells.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:00.440
25% of the entire drug
targets are GPCRs.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.520
They respond to all
kinds of signals--

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.370
amines, amino acids, lipids,
little peptides, proteins,

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.540
nucleotides--

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.360
all commonly going
through the G protein

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.870
coupled receptor to give you a
similar phenomenon to what I've

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.370
described to you.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.580
And what I think is
particularly interesting--

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.950
I'm going to post all
of these as slides.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.500
What I want you to see,
this was quite a while

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.580
back, but it just shows you so
many of trademarked drugs that

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.460
target different GPCRs--

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.610
they're shown here-- and
what diseases they're

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.120
used for to treat, and
what's the generic name

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.210
of those drugs.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.900
So you can see here
many, many diseases

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.380
have at the heart and
soul of their problem

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.370
different receptors.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.490
And these are all G
protein coupled receptors

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.820
that are treated
with small molecules

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.620
that bind to the receptor
and often glue it

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.200
in an inactive state
so it can't, then,

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.130
bind to an activating signal and
have all the rest of the events

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.780
occur.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.780
There are very few
structures of the G protein

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.460
coupled receptors, but
there are some of them.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.050
So many of the target G
protein coupled receptors

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.960
can be modeled computationally.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.480
And then you can
do a lot of work

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.670
where you actually
model the receptor

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.490
in a membrane
environment and start

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.300
searching for drugs through
computational approaches.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.700
And I thought a lot of you
might be interested in this.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.160
Because this is a
really strong axis

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.910
where bioinformatics,
confirmation,

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.040
and advanced physics
and molecular dynamics

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.740
can be brought to
bear on drug discovery

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.680
when you don't have
perfect molecular models

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.820
of your targets.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.800
OK, so now we're going to move
to a different kind of signal.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.580
We're going to talk about the
receptor tyrosine kinases.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:57.860
All right, so in the receptor
tyrosine kinase responses,

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.070
we can often see very
similar paradigms

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:04.750
to what I've just shown you.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.090
But there is an
important distinction.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:24.290
Receptor tyrosine kinases,
we often call these RTKs.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.300
So that's their shorthand.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.830
So over here, I described
to you different kinases.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:35.270
That we have kinases that
modify threonine, serine,

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.565
and tyrosine.

00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:41.870
The receptor tyrosine kinase
is a subset of tyrosine kinases

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.280
that form part of a receptor.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.360
So if you were to think
about various kinases,

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.500
you would have the
serine/threonine,

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.620
and you would have
the tyrosine ones.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.150
But these would
be differentiated

00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:03.280
into the ones that are part of
a membrane protein, the RTKs,

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.590
and then the ones that are
soluble in the cytoplasm.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.380
And the serine/threonine
ones are most commonly

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.270
soluble in the cytoplasm.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.840
I'm going to focus on the
receptor tyrosine kinases

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.780
because they do slightly
different activities when they

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.390
signal relative to the GPCRs.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.060
So that's once again,
this is a situation,

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.540
another paradigm where you
see a series of events.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.610
But with a number of
the receptor tyrosine

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.460
kinase pathways,
the ultimate action

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.070
ends up being in
the nucleus where,

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.620
as a result of an
extracellular signal,

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.460
you get a series of events that
ends up with a protein being

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.620
sent into the nucleus.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.890
And that protein may be a
transcription factor that

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.180
binds to a promoter region.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:53.220
And as a result of that, you'll
get gene transcription occur.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.030
You'll transcribe a
gene, make a messenger

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.120
RNA that will leave the
nucleus and cause action

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.235
within the cell.

00:43:00.235 --> 00:43:01.610
So this is a little
bit different

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:06.620
than the other response
that was mainly cytoplasmic.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.470
OK, so let's take a look at
the receptor tyrosine kinases.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.440
Receptor tyrosine
kinases are proteins

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.800
that span the membrane
but rather differently

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.410
from the GPCRs.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.790
And they have a domain
that's extracellular, just

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.050
a single transmembrane domain.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.730
So this is out.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.840
This is in.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.170
And then they have an
intracellular domain.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.705
This would be where
the ligand binds.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.370
This would be how there's some
kind of signal transducing.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.500
And this would be
a kinase domain.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.410
OK, so how do we get
the information in?

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:57.260
When we saw the GPCRs, we saw
the ability of those seven TMs

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.830
to kind of reorganize and
send information in the cell.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.050
With the receptor
tyrosine kinases,

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:04.580
it's kind of different.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.100
There are regions of
the membrane where there

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.140
are a lot of these proteins.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.120
They commonly bind small
peptides and protein molecules.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.310
And when they're in
their activated form,

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:20.300
once the small protein binds,
the receptor tyrosine kinase

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.550
forms a dimeric structure.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.480
That is, two of these
get together only

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.600
upon ligand binding.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.510
They move together once
there is a ligand bound.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.410
And then what happens is that
the tyrosine kinase domains

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.450
phosphorylate each other.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.050
And that's activation in the
case of receptor tyrosine

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.340
kinases.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.980
So when the small protein
ligand is not around,

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.620
this is a singleton.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.570
It doesn't work on itself.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.410
Once this ligand binds,
interactions change.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.650
You get a dimeric
structure where one kinase

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.100
can phosphorylate
what's called in trans

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.540
the other kinase domains.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.283
So it's different
from the GPCRs.

00:45:09.283 --> 00:45:10.950
It's got a different
kind of feel to it,

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.400
but it's still a dynamic
transient signal.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.040
Let's take a look at
this within a cell

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.960
and see what kinds
of responses--

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.840
and this is in
response to EGF, which

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.150
is epidermal growth factor.

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.700
It's a cytokine that
promotes cell division.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.410
So a lot happens with respect
to the action of a cell,

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:34.710
not to produce ATP,
but now to respond

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.580
by producing all the elements
that enable cells to grow

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.750
and proliferate.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.950
So the epidermal
growth factor binds.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.930
You get dimerization.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:50.100
Upon that dimerization,
the kinase domain in one

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.020
structure-- in the blue one--

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.840
phosphorylates the
other, and vice versa.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.610
They phosphorylate each
other intermolecularly.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.130
Once that has happened, through
the auspices of another protein

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.590
I won't bother you
with the name of,

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:08.310
this phosphorylated
intracellular RTK

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.220
binds to a small G protein.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.130
In this case, it's a
monomeric G protein,

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:18.720
not one of the trimeric ones,
a small one known as RAS.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.230
Once that binding event
occurs, guess what?

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.270
RAS gets activated.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:28.430
It's now binding
GTP instead of GDP.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.590
And then it starts going
through a sequence of events

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:36.230
where there's a ton
of controlled cellular

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.250
phosphorylation
events that result

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.490
in moving a protein into
the nucleus that helps

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:44.550
form a transcription
complex that results

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.800
in cellular proliferation.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.050
Similar but different
series of events.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.180
There's still amplification.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.680
There's still dynamics.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.000
And in this case, it's a lot
of phosphorylation events.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.870
And what I want
to sort of define

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:01.260
for you is that many
of these pathways

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.790
are in trouble in
disease states.

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:07.770
Be it inflammation,
neurodegeneration, or cancer,

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:12.480
there is aberrant behavior of
proteins within these pathways

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.660
that cause them to go wrong,
cause cells to proliferate out

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.350
of control or undergo
bad responses.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.390
And that is why
these proteins end up

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.930
being therapeutic targets
like the G protein coupled

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:25.590
receptors.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.260
OK, so we've seen the
characteristics of signaling.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.550
We've seen a signal.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.380
We've seen amplification.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.000
We've seen responses.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.940
What I just want
to quickly show you

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.060
is an idea about integration.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.210
So here's an idea with
two signaling pathways

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.930
that sort of end up with the
same signal outside where you

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:54.560
integrate actions through
two different signaling

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.910
pathways to achieve a bigger,
different kind of response.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:02.390
So that's that last hallmark
of signaling pathways.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:05.480
It's not that every pathway
is clean and straight.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.940
It has cross-talk
with other pathways

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.820
and you get amplified
or different responses.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.680
Tremendously complicated.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.510
I want to give
you one more term.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.460
And then I'll show one table.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.550
When these pathways
go wrong, it's often

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.160
because switches get stuck on.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:28.700
So for example, a G protein gets
stuck in its GTP-bound state

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.270
or doesn't even need
GTP to be activated.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.630
Or a tyrosine kinase
is stuck activated.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:47.210
And that's what's called
constitutively active,

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:49.505
basically meaning
it's permanently on.

00:48:49.505 --> 00:48:53.450
So many of the diseases
that are caused by mutations

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.730
in your genome, not
genetic diseases

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:00.290
but mutations in your genes
in some particular cells,

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:02.540
end up with
constitutive activation

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.420
where you don't need a
signal to have a response.

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.930
And so for example, cells may
proliferate out of control.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:13.490
So that is an important
term to know and understand.

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:16.220
Because constitutive
activation basically

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.640
means that a receptor may
be active in the absence

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.630
of a ligand.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:22.670
And I believe this
is my last slide.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.800
I just wanted to
leave you with this.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.620
When one thinks of
GPCRs, there are

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.110
tremendous therapeutic targets.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.430
The world of kinases
is no less important.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.050
This scale is in
billions of dollars

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:41.270
spent on developing molecules
that may be curative

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.260
of diseases that involve
dysregulated signaling.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.620
And what you see on this, I
want to point out two things.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.480
Of course this thing stops
working at the last minutes.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.210
But what I want to point
out is this particular bar.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.370
This represents the
billions of dollars

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.120
spent on protein
kinase inhibitors

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.270
over a five-year period.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.840
And it's just escalating
and escalating.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.200
Similarly, monoclonal
antibodies are very important.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.860
But the small molecule
drugs hold a real dominance.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.020
What do these drugs do?

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.750
They enable you to have
small molecules that

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.990
can go into dysregulated
signaling pathways

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:25.550
and stop the activity somewhere
in the pathway to avoid signals

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:28.490
going constantly to the
nucleus and turning things

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.860
on all the time.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.935
So both of these types of
functions in cellular signaling

00:50:33.935 --> 00:50:36.320
are ones you want
to understand both

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.100
from a biological perspective
but from a medical perspective.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.650
OK--

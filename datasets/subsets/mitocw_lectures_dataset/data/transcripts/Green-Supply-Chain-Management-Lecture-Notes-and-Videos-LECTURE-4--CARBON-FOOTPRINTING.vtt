00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.340
PROFESSOR: Basically,
the goal for today--

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.390
we're going to sort of
go through the case study

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.244
that we had to do just
as a basic framing tool,

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:41.660
and then talk about what it
means to do a corporate carbon

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.310
footprint.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.560
What are the mechanisms of it?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.410
What are the issues
that you run into?

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.370
And really the
goal of it is this.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.960
One, understand.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.210
It's a pretty simple process,
in terms of there's not much

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.310
complexity or theoretical
complexity to it.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.810
In practice, it's
much more a matter

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.510
of data gathering,
decisions, talking

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.410
with your marketing
communications people-- things

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.950
like that.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.820
But just to get the
mechanics of what

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.630
goes into a corporate
carbon footprint down

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.440
and how you might use
it to identify where

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.886
the emissions are
in your company,

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.010
probably the more important
things are this, right?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.019
Understand the
measurement approach.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.560
What is a corporate
carbon footprint?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.100
How does it compare
to other things,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.650
like a supply chain carbon
footprint or a product carbon

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.310
footprint, and how
do they go together?

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.740
And the other one
is to understand

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.144
what this means, since
most big companies do

00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:32.060
release their greenhouse
gas emissions, right?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.319
But as we go through
this stuff, we

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.860
will see that there's a lot of
discretion that goes into what

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.160
exactly they do with that.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.500
So the goal would hopefully
be that, as you go out,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.070
as you're working on
your class project.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.170
Or as you start seeing companies
doing press releases or things

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.880
about how they cut x amount
of emissions or whatnot,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.730
understand what went into
that and be able to challenge

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.402
whether they're really
making much of contribution

00:01:58.402 --> 00:01:59.360
or what goes into that.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.050
So that's sort of
what we're hoping

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.810
to get out of today's lecture.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510
And at the end, we'll
probably wrap up

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.915
by talking about how this
relates to next class, which

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:10.039
will be about life cycle
assessment, which is going

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.030
to be about a more
detailed methodology

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.820
for doing product-level
comparisons.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.750
So what I want to
do first is just

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.930
take maybe 10 or 15 minutes here
and just sort of recap the case

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.244
study and go over the basics.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.660
And then I'm going
to have you get

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.820
into groups and sort of
small groups to discuss

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.405
and come together as a consensus
about what your approach is

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:35.280
going to be in terms of
what you're including

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.040
and what you're not
in the calculations.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.920
Partly just because
just to make sure

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.390
we've all arrived at sort of
the same general conclusions

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.740
about how this works,
I did look through most

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.070
of what you submitted, though.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.278
Most of it's not too trouble.

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:52.560
There's usually a few things
that sometimes trip people up.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.030
So I'll go over what those
are so you'll have a chance

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.810
to sort of-- in your groups, you
can revise or make some changes

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.170
if that's the case.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.610
So again, what
we're looking at--

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.230
we're putting you in
the shoes of WidgetCo.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.120
Essentially you are
a chair manufacturer

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.409
selling office-type chairs,
where you manufacture them.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.700
You own your own manufacturing.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.870
You sell primarily to
customers in the US,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.690
both at the retail level
and to industrial consumers.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.120
Facilities-wise, you have
two manufacturing plants.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.040
One is located in Shanghai.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.762
The one is located
here in US in Michigan.

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.220
The one in Michigan
is fully owned.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.730
The one in China as
a 50-50 joint venture

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.094
with local investors.

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:35.510
You have two
distributions centers

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.020
in the US-- one in
California and one in Georgia

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.670
that you use for finished goods.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.480
And you also have a partnership
with a large retailer that

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.700
sets aside some dedicated
space within each

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.310
of their large big box retailers
dedicated to just showcasing

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.670
your products.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.850
Transportation.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.050
You use a 3PL to bring in
imported materials and finished

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.550
goods.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.020
So you have the
raw materials that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.910
come in by ocean that get sent
to your factory in Michigan.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.530
You also have
finished chairs coming

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.070
in from the plant in China.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.150
Those come in over a dedicated
3PL by ocean to get to the US

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.019
and then by rail and by
truck once they arrive.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.421
For the retail channel,
you service that primarily

00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:21.670
with your private truck fleet.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.211
So you own a fleet
of trucks that you

00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:24.966
use to deliver to retailers.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.340
And then you make
up for the rest

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.840
of the volume that
you can't handle,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.670
either by air or by lessened
truckload shipments.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.710
And finally, for the
industrial channel,

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.880
most of your customers, they
actually come and pick it up.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.910
So you don't handle
that transportation.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.990
The remaining 40% are
done by deliveries.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.260
I think it was by LTL.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.520
So that's basically
what we have here,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.670
is sort of the
supply chain flow.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.450
Most of your suppliers
are located off in China.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.960
That's where your raw materials
and parts of coming to,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.300
shipping it out to your plants
in Michigan and Shanghai.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.960
Again, this in channel,
all this goes on in the US.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.520
And just if we look at
it in terms of this flow,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.600
this is sort of where our
transportation has come in.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.260
So pretty straightforward and
simplified example of a supply

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.950
chain.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.170
And the goal is to go
through and figure out

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.730
what your carbon footprint is
based on a couple of things,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.230
right?

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.520
You're getting pressure
from investors.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.920
You're getting it maybe
from some of your customers

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.820
asking about it.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.920
So now it's starting
to get some attention

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.980
within the organization,
from the CEO.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.750
And basically you're
the one put in charge

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.740
of figuring out what that is.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.300
The pressure's sort
of ratcheting up.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.540
So FerretCo is basically
your main direct competitor.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.255
They operated a little
bit lower price point.

00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:44.880
But they're starting
to try to increase

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.560
their profile by doing some of
the sustainability initiatives.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.680
So part of that is they want
to move into the retail space,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.200
whereas previously
they've mainly

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.410
served industrial companies.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.750
So as part of that, they've
released their carbon footprint

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.120
publicly disclosed in the
carbon Disclosure Project.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.190
And that came out at
55,000 tons of CO2.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.350
Based on their sales
and their product,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.550
that was 1.1
kilograms per product.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.380
So that's aggregate emissions.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.930
And this is sort of a
per-product or per-unit level.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.680
They've also announced
a plan that they're

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.220
going to become carbon neutral.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.670
And also they're exploring
putting a carbon label

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.709
on their retail products.

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:20.250
A new entry into
the market-- they're

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.330
trying to appeal directly
to the end consumers

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.410
that they'll be
trying to sell to.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.230
So with that in place, if
we look at the supply chain,

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.680
we have a number of different
emission sources, right?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.050
We have all these different
transportation pieces

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.970
that are linking
these different flows

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.220
that we have some data for.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.726
We have emissions
coming from our plants,

00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:42.600
in terms of electricity
and direct emissions.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.020
So obviously you're
consuming electricity

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.590
that generated emissions of
PowerPoint when it was created.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.340
You also might have
some direct emissions.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.090
We don't specify where
that's coming from,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.420
but you might be burning
natural gas or fuel

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.430
oil in the facilities.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.890
Other types of
manufacturing processes--

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.720
might release
chemicals directly,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.330
especially in chemicals.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.780
Agricultural companies, right?

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.980
They produce other types
of direct admissions.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.140
But we'll just leave it as
direct emissions in this case.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.140
You also have some of
these different facilities

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.500
that are consuming electricity.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.450
So if your DCs and also
what's going on at-- you

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.450
have those dedicated little
show rooms in big depot.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.680
So this is essentially
the calculation

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680
set up that we gave you.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.600
I do want to go over
just two quickly.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.180
So first, facility is pretty
straightforward-- electricity

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.920
consumption times
the emissions factor.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.790
This is in general how basically
every calculation goes, right?

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.070
You have these
emissions factors that

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.319
are published by organizations
like the Greenhouse Gas

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.902
Protocol that are going to tell
you what the emissions are--

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:48.860
four different factors.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.904
So different fuel types
and different electricity

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.320
consumptions, where
they're going.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.850
How much do they emit?

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.840
And then basically it's
your job to gather data

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.640
about how much you consumed
or how much of that material

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.932
you used, a factor in
the direct emissions.

00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:04.140
For some of these other
things, when that data is not

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.800
available-- especially if this
is the case in transportation--

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.008
you might have a choice of
several different methods.

00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:12.020
So in this case, we had
two different ones-- one

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.180
based on ton-miles and one
based on fuel consumption.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.410
So this would generally be
the preferred choice-- fuel

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.322
consumption-- mainly
because it's simple.

00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:22.780
If you know how
much fuel consumed,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.880
you know the
emissions factor, you

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.650
know how much
emissions it produce.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.170
And in cases like
diesel or gasoline,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.840
the CO2 emissions are
pretty much directly tied.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.309
It's basically a one-to-one
correspondence in terms of,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.520
every gallon of fuel you
consume is going to produce

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.919
a set amount of emissions.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.179
It's not going to
change too much.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.856
So you'd like to get to
that fuel consumption.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.730
But that's not always
easy to get, especially

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.396
when you're hiring a
third-party carrier

00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:48.600
or, more importantly,
when you're using

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.066
shared transportation assets.

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:51.440
So on a dedicated
transportation,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.890
I hire a truckload company.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.076
They come up, they put
my goods on the truck,

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.200
and they take it someplace.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.780
It's nothing but
my goods on there.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.321
So all of the emissions that
are generated when that truck is

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.060
going would be dedicated to me.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.150
So I can just try to
maybe make an estimate

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.319
of the fuel consumed and get
how much the emissions would be.

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:09.860
When you're looking
at rail or ocean,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.360
where an ocean ship
might have thousands

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.984
of different containers
on it and maybe

00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:15.030
only one or two of
those are your goods,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.710
you're not really
interested in how much

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.480
the total ship or the total
rail car might have emitted.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.210
You want to know how much is
essentially dedicated to you.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.780
So in this case, usually
what we do is that.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.270
We would measure the
efficiency of the vehicles

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.065
in terms of how much
fuel they consume

00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:35.130
or emissions they all
put per ton-mile, right?

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.240
So a ton-mile is a
pretty common indicator

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.510
in the transportation, right?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:46.660
And that's just 1
ton times 1 mile.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.280
If you move one ton of goods
one mile, that's one ton-mile.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.465
So you can think about it.

00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:56.090
If you have 20 tons on there and
you go one mile, 20 ton-miles.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.740
So if you had one
ton and you took it

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.142
20 miles, also 20 ton-miles.

00:10:00.142 --> 00:10:01.600
The reason we would
do it like this

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.180
is because generally those
larger vehicles-- the larger

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.240
the ocean ship goes, the
more fuel it consumes, say,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.050
per kilometer that it moves.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.360
But as it's starting
to aggregate,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.369
it carries more and
more goods on it.

00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:16.410
So it's actually becoming
more efficient in terms

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.960
of the actual goods
that it moves,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.060
because it can move
a lot more product

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.200
that same amount of distance
on a less amount of fuel.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.930
So lower fuel consumption.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.900
The trick with this--
and this is something

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.560
that tripped a few
of you up on it--

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.510
is when you have
aggregated data, right?

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.350
So if you look at
the data that we had,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.680
we don't have a breakdown
of every single shipment,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.006
especially when you're a company
that's maybe making thousands

00:10:42.006 --> 00:10:43.130
and thousands of shipments.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.870
You may not have a direct
record of every single shipment

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.010
that you send, in terms of its
distance and its total tonnage.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.810
So what you might
get is something

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.840
like what we gave you.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.660
Say you knew that you had--
let's do a quick example.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.590
Say we just add two shipments.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.730
That's all we sent.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.140
And the first one, I had 10 tons
on it and I sent it 10 miles.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:18.890
So pretty simple.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.314
That's 100 ton-miles.

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:21.730
The second one,
we have five times

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.550
and we send up five miles.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.820
That's 25 ton-miles.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:30.750
So in total, I moved 125
ton-miles' worth of goods.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.150
The trick is this, is that if
we were to aggregate this--

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.285
and this is what you are
given in the exercise.

00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:41.940
You know something like,
you sent two shipments.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.530
And you moved a total 15 tons.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.810
And you moved a total
of 15 miles, right?

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.500
The problem is that
if you try to take

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.490
these aggregated numbers and
just multiply them together--

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.605
15 times 15.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.450
It's 225, right?

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.780
It's very different from
what you actually did.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.740
And this goes back to our--

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.090
If we go all the way
back to, I don't know,

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.340
our junior high math, right?

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.615
A times B plus C times
D. That does not equal--

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.940
Right.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.150
So I can't add these two and
add these two and multiply them.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.550
You just get a different number.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.280
So if you just
take the aggregate

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.280
you did, especially when
we had 1,000 shipments.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.020
So you moved 26 million
miles or whatever it was,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.454
and you moved 50
million kilograms

00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:41.870
and just multiplied
them together.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.930
You got some really huge number.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.730
And it probably threw
off the calculations.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.855
You ended up having, say,
your ocean transportation

00:12:48.855 --> 00:12:51.660
or something being by far the
largest source of emissions.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.200
So that's just one
thing to look out for.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.520
When we've done this--
we've given this in the past

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.000
with the executive
ed participants.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.640
And 99% of them always
do the same thing.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.130
So I knew that would
possibly trip you up.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.580
But I think in the
examples that we gave,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.680
we broke it out is that
one way to get around

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.872
this would be to assume it
went the average distance

00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:15.830
and the average weight,
and then multiply those

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.410
together, and then multiply
it by the number of shipments.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.250
It won't be exact,
but it'll be closer,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.214
because if you just add them
up and then multiply them,

00:13:23.214 --> 00:13:25.130
you're going to be off
by orders of magnitude.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.810
So in terms of the calculations,
that was just one of the things

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.791
I saw that that is
tricky to look out for.

00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:35.050
The emissions factor.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.460
So we only gave you
a limited set here.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.300
But if you go out and look at
the greenhouse gas protocol,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.740
there will be an emissions
factor for basically every type

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.240
of fuel.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.070
So you'll have coal, natural
gas, fuel oil, diesel,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.140
gasoline-- all
different sort of ones.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.100
So even though we
just basically did

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.730
electricity and
diesel in here, there

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.460
are a whole host
of other factors.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.970
So if you have a
company that's consuming

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.680
different types of energy,
the same principle applies.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.990
You know how many cubic feet
of natural gas you consumed,

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.570
and you know its factor.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.340
For most companies,
you're not going

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.794
to really need much more than
this to do the calculations,

00:14:11.794 --> 00:14:13.460
because most companies
aren't doing much

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.320
other than either burning fuel,
either in furnaces or bunkers

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.500
or in vehicles or
consuming electricity.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.690
They do make some
specialized calculators

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.030
for different sectors-- cement
manufacturing, certain chemical

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.507
production, paper pulp.

00:14:28.507 --> 00:14:30.090
Things that actually
produce emissions

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.280
through, say, different
chemical processes that are not

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.446
going to be covered by that.

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:36.670
But for the most part, most
companies and most facilities

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.930
are just going to be able
to be done by these pretty

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.230
simple calculations.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.220
And just in terms of the actual
underlying mechanics of this.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.740
So most of the time, when
we're talking about a carbon

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.340
footprint, we're talking about
the six gases that are usually

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.930
known as the Kyoto gases.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.670
These are the six gases that
were covered under the Kyoto

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.820
Protocol.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.010
Carbon dioxide, especially
in transportation and fuel

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.410
consumption, is by far
the largest contributor.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.480
They usually also produce
perhaps a little bit

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.240
of methane, nitrous oxide.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.610
And other processes might
produce HFCs, PFCs, sulfur

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.770
hexafluoride.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.060
There are other gases that
contribute to global warming,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.530
other greenhouse gases.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.790
But they're not necessarily
covered under Kyoto.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.930
So this is just something
to look out for,

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.810
especially refrigerants
and some of the others

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.360
that were covered under
the ozone, the Montreal

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.240
Protocol, which covered ozone.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.917
Since they were already
being regulated,

00:15:30.917 --> 00:15:32.750
they weren't included
in the Kyoto Protocol.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.160
So a lot of things, especially
like the greenhouse gas

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.590
protocol, don't require
you to measure those.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.990
But you can measure those
and report them separately,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:46.210
because they do contribute to
the overall greenhouse effect.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.690
Our emissions
factors are usually

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.690
represented in a single unit,
carbon dioxide equivalence.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.525
Essentially we're trying
to measure different gases,

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:57.650
contribute to global warming
and different amounts,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.120
based on how much radiative
forcing they cause.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.570
So essentially, every
kilogram of methane,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.170
say, contributes, say, as much
global warming as 34 kilograms

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.392
of carbon dioxide.

00:16:10.392 --> 00:16:11.850
So essentially what
would happen is

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.770
that every kilogram of
methane you would multiply

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.380
by its global warming
potential to determine

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.900
how much carbon dioxide
that would be equivalent to.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.190
And so all of these
factors that we give

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.290
are in terms of carbon
dioxide equivalence.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.820
So they're incorporating the
amount of methane and nitrous

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.660
oxide that might be
emitted in there as well.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.240
Part of this is that
these constantly

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.281
get updated-- or not
constantly, but occasionally

00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:38.320
updated as part of
the IPCC process.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.830
So they actually just
released in 2013,

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.970
I think, the fifth
version of this.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.720
And so some of these
factors have changed.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.095
So that's something
to keep track

00:16:47.095 --> 00:16:50.160
of, especially for a company
that's doing it long term.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.996
Those factors can
change as you go,

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:54.370
which sometimes means you need
to go back and recalculate

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.540
and figure it.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.282
And one thing to be careful
for is that people typically

00:16:58.282 --> 00:16:59.740
refer to things as
carbon footprint

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.370
or the amount of
carbon they're doing.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.161
Sometimes when they
say that, they actually

00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:05.109
mean just the carbon dioxide.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.630
Most the time it includes
all of these gases.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.432
But you should be careful
and look out for that,

00:17:10.432 --> 00:17:12.140
and make sure you're
stating that upfront

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.681
when you're doing
this sort of thing,

00:17:13.681 --> 00:17:17.910
whether you included all of
these or just carbon dioxide.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.099
The other thing we asked in
here was the emission scopes.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.869
So this is actually
pretty straightforward.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.540
Once you think about
what is included

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.750
in your organizational
boundary and whatnot,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.630
scope one is direct
emissions, right?

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.370
They're direct because
you could put a CO2

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.860
to monitor and
actually monitor it,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.984
because they're directly
coming from your facility,

00:17:38.984 --> 00:17:41.620
either from your burning
fuels usually or from one

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.850
of those chemical processes.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.460
So they're the
emissions that are

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.570
coming from the
vehicles you own--

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.020
they're yours-- or
within your facilities,

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.780
directly coming at those
facilities, usually basically

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.700
through fossil fuel combustion.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.856
Scope two are the
indirect emissions

00:17:55.856 --> 00:17:56.980
that come from electricity.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.037
So your facility is
consuming electricity.

00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:01.620
Those emissions are
actually occurring

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.703
at the power plant, where
they're burning the coal

00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:05.660
to supply that electricity.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.900
So we report that
as a separate scope,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.890
because most companies
and most buildings

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.420
are making use of electricity.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.430
So usually this falls into sort
of the basic minimum carbon

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.930
footprint that we would consider
for an organization-- scope

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.110
one and scope two.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.490
Scope three is all the other
indirect emissions, right?

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.490
So one thing to remember is
that all these emissions are

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.080
somebody's direct emissions.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.220
But they may not
necessarily be what you're

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.790
consider your organization.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.450
So anything that's not in
your scope one or scope two

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.847
is going to be scope three,
probably because it's

00:18:37.847 --> 00:18:38.930
somebody else's scope one.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.857
So when you're going
through and thinking

00:18:40.857 --> 00:18:42.940
about what's in your
organizational boundary, what

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.040
you've decided as part of your
carbon footprint-- scope one,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.800
emissions you're
directly producing;

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.370
scope two, the ones
that are coming

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.100
from electricity
that you consume;

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.046
and basically everything
else is scope three.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.685
AUDIENCE: For transportation,
if I owned a fleet,

00:19:00.685 --> 00:19:02.070
would that be scope one?

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.997
And if I hire someone to move
it, would that be scope three?

00:19:05.997 --> 00:19:07.455
I'm not really sure
how that works.

00:19:07.455 --> 00:19:08.121
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:09.540
In general, these
are going to be

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:15.339
things that occur directly owned
by you or in your-- sometimes

00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:16.130
you may not own it.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.160
But if you have direct
control over it,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.850
especially like some
facilities where

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.450
you have a long-term lease or
if you have a arrangement where

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.130
you put down a long term
for hire with a carrier,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.065
they still might be scope
one even if you didn't do it.

00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:31.670
It's Based on what
you defined as

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.100
your organizational boundary.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.620
So scope one and scope two
are things that you basically

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.040
have to report, because
you directly admitted

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.120
them or they have electricity.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.020
Scope three are
things that you might

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.570
want to consider within your
carbon footprint boundary

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.780
but aren't directly owned
or within your organization.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.710
AUDIENCE: Generally
emissions from the usage

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.910
would not be
considered [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.570
for the purpose of this?

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.490
PROFESSOR: Of the
products that you produce?

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.710
Yeah.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.262
Yes, so we'll talk about
this a little bit later.

00:20:07.262 --> 00:20:09.720
Scope three is anything that's
not scope one and scope two.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.615
And you may be
mandated on a minimum

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:15.666
that you need to include.

00:20:15.666 --> 00:20:17.040
But usually there's
no regulation

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.520
that says you can't include
something in your boundary.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.510
So you could include those
within your company's boundary.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.680
But if it's a product you're
selling to a consumer,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.690
that would fall under
scope three of indirect.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.530
And we'll talk a little
bit more about this

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.352
at the end when we
go through this.

00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:37.310
Again, so the case study,
basically go through.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.092
We sort of listed
all the activities

00:20:39.092 --> 00:20:41.300
in the spreadsheet, asked
you to go through, identify

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.250
the emission factor, and
identify the activity driver.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.122
So how much you
consumed of that.

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.460
How much you wanted to include
in your company's carbon

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.970
footprint, anywhere
from 0 to 100.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.040
So if you were
excluding it, zero.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.790
And then if you
are including it,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.452
you'd have to give some
percentage for that and why.

00:20:57.452 --> 00:20:59.910
And identify whether they're
scope one, scope two, or scope

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.350
three emissions.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.470
Decide whether you're
going to disclose this,

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.440
and what you're including.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.409
And also, given what
FerretCo's doing,

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:12.700
how do you feel about pledging
to become carbon neutral

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.200
or labeling your products?

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.840
So we've already
gone through it.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.240
Hopefully you all
did originally.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.294
But I want to give
you a few minutes

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.460
now just to sit in small
groups and talk it through.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.834
And then we'll
use that as a-- so

00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:27.340
you'll have a chance to go
back through the calculations

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.060
and settle on as a
small group one number

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.390
that we'll use as the
discussion within your group.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.640
So you can go back throughout.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.098
We've talked it
through and revised

00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:39.790
any of the calculations or the
scope, if you need to do that.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.220
So let's just
separate into small--

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.970
I don't know-- three,
four, two, whatever.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.910
Just get together.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.920
So you have somebody
else to go over it with.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.205
Hopefully each group
has a computer with them

00:21:50.205 --> 00:21:52.560
that they can pull up
the spreadsheet on.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.547
And let's just take-- I don't
know-- 10 minutes, 15 minutes,

00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.630
or whatever and go through
and come up with those.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.760
And then we'll sort of
run through all of this.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.580
So the first question we have
is, what is WidgetCo's carbon

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.750
footprint.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.020
So why don't we go through.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.860
And tell me how many times
you said WidgetCo's carbon

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.610
footprint was.

00:22:21.522 --> 00:22:22.480
How many thousand tons.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.438
AUDIENCE: The total
aggregate carbon footprint?

00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:25.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.252
AUDIENCE: 393.

00:22:28.252 --> 00:22:30.660
PROFESSOR: 393.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.147
Yeah, a thousand tons.

00:22:33.147 --> 00:22:38.858
AUDIENCE: 395.

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:39.608
PROFESSOR: Others?

00:22:43.087 --> 00:22:47.560
AUDIENCE: We had two different
[INAUDIBLE]-- 399 and--

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.045
AUDIENCE: I725.

00:22:50.045 --> 00:22:53.027
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:56.506 --> 00:22:57.735
AUDIENCE: 378.

00:22:57.735 --> 00:22:58.360
PROFESSOR: 378?

00:23:05.404 --> 00:23:06.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.910
PROFESSOR: 680 was the other?

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:17.540
AUDIENCE: 650.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.631
PROFESSOR: 650.

00:23:21.631 --> 00:23:22.130
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:30.471 --> 00:23:32.010
AUDIENCE: Do I need
to do something?

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.640
Hello?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.045
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we hear you.

00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:35.990
AUDIENCE: 305.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.565
PROFESSOR: 305?

00:23:37.565 --> 00:23:38.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:45.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:50.740
So I went through it earlier and
compiled the individual answers

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.040
from the people
that had submitted.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.910
So here's what they look like.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:01.230
So we had a couple outliers,
because this is basically

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.080
just a calculator.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.532
And they're in the calculation
overestimating the ton-mile

00:24:04.532 --> 00:24:05.490
or something like that.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.840
So if we bring it down to
scale or something like this.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.280
Most of you answered
in that range

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.020
that we talked
about-- 300 to 400.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.100
Some high or some less.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.880
We can see where did
those emissions come from.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.673
I went through and pulled
out a few possibilities.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.900
The highest level-- if
we included everything

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.930
on that list, right?

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.714
100% of the emissions
for everything

00:24:33.714 --> 00:24:34.630
that was on that list.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.910
That would be essentially
our supply chain emissions

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.370
for this portion of
the supply chain.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.670
That comes out to about
$580,000 tons, right?

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:48.440
So on a per kilogram of product
basis, that's about 6.93.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.605
So that should be probably be
the upper end of the range,

00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:54.300
because that's
including everything

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.290
that we had in there.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.380
You might have made some
different assumptions

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.129
in how we calculated
some of these things.

00:25:00.129 --> 00:25:02.640
So that's probably why
some are 395 and 399.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.410
Things like that can
make them smaller.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.680
Differences in there.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.480
The real question,
though, comes to be--

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.389
I mean, the main thing is, how
much of that Shanghai operation

00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:14.180
are we considering?

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.680
So if we look at the
supply chain emissions,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.130
we have the
manufacturing in the US.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.890
And most of you-- everybody
was pretty consistent on that.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.090
Straightforward once you
make the calculation.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.760
We pretty much have
to include that.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.000
We own that.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.140
It's all scope one or
scope two emissions.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.884
The plant in China--
same deal, right?

00:25:35.884 --> 00:25:38.300
Scope one or scope two, if
we've included in the boundary.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.340
But we can make
some different calls

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.926
based on what sort of
organizational boundary we

00:25:42.926 --> 00:25:43.730
want to set.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.940
And so if you look at it in the
greenhouse gas protocol-- so

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.041
as one of the standards and
probably the most popular

00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:51.540
standard.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.380
It basically outlines
two different approaches

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:53.921
you can take.

00:25:53.921 --> 00:25:56.130
One is an equity
share approach, right?

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.220
So you say, well, how
much of this do I own?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.890
And I'll calculate
the whole emissions.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.890
And then I own
50% of that plant,

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.490
so I'm going to take
50% of those emissions.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.220
So if we were to do the
equity share approach,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.740
those emissions from the China
plant get cut in half, right?

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.420
And so I get a lower, right?

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.170
The important thing
to remember about this

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.312
is that, at the
corporate level, it

00:26:18.312 --> 00:26:19.520
was mentioned earlier, right?

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.310
It's accounting,
as you guys say.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.410
And if you look at the
greenhouse gas protocol,

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.860
it's a corporate accounting
and reporting standard.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.110
Nothing changes in
terms of the supply

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.370
chain or the actual operations,
the actual emissions

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.720
that were out there, right?

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.332
We're just changing
how much of them

00:26:33.332 --> 00:26:34.915
we're going to take
responsibility for

00:26:34.915 --> 00:26:37.140
or how much we're going
to include in our own.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.530
So that's the equity
share, which is basically,

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.260
anything that I own
a percentage of,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.250
I take that percentage
of emissions.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.080
And so all the things
that I own are 100%.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.420
And actually it can
go down even more

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.077
if we want to
exclude all of the--

00:26:51.077 --> 00:26:52.910
there's all these scope
three activities out

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.730
there as well that I
don't actually own those,

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.160
so I can exclude those as well.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.790
The other approach is what they
refer to as a control approach.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.840
And they can do financial
or operational control.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.300
So this, we would probably
need to know a little bit more

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.780
about what's going
on at that plant

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.800
to decide what the right
approach was, because it could

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.850
easily be, I'll take
100% of those emissions

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.830
or I'll take 0%, depending
on who's actually

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.330
running the plant
and who's actually

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.060
making all of those
decisions, who ultimately

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.200
have responsibility
for everything that's

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.980
going on in there.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.110
If I've just invested in it
and my partner-- I've invested

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.110
and I've done a joint
venture, because they have

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.230
all of the local knowledge.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.550
They're the ones
with the expertise.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.008
They're basically
running the plant

00:27:33.008 --> 00:27:34.310
and making all the decisions.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.020
And I'm doing an
operational control.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.420
Then maybe I say I have 0%.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.530
And so I might throw that out
of my emissions in my company.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.580
Most likely, if it's
a 50-50 joint venture,

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.200
supplying directly to you, you
have some operational control

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.040
over that, right?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.390
They're manufacturing your
product almost exclusively.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.134
So even then, you
might say, even

00:27:53.134 --> 00:27:54.550
though it's a 50-50
joint venture,

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.570
I'll go ahead and
take 100% control.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.240
You don't really have
much of a decision

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.570
other than 0, 50, or
100 on this, right?

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.780
The emissions that are there,
you either account for them

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.509
or you don't.

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:11.550
That is, they're in your
boundary or they're not.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.600
And so that's a 0% or 100% on
the operational control side.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.270
And on the equity share, it's
basically just decided 50-50.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.999
So you don't get to
really hedge and say,

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:23.290
well, I'm only going to take
a third of these emissions

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.700
or something like that.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.289
At the lowest level, we could
do something like-- just

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:30.830
my corporate emissions,
which is just

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.288
going to say, this would be
what you would get if you said,

00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:35.570
I'm only going to
include things I directly

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.120
own-- 100% ownership for.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.520
So that's going to be
just my Michigan plant.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.080
Adjust my distribution centers.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.220
Adjust my private fleet.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.320
Those are the things that I
own, I have direct control over.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.145
I'm only going to include those.

00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:51.470
If you did that,
you'll get something

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:57.340
just a bit over
200,000 tons on that.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.801
So one of the other
things is that, when

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:01.300
we look at all those
different scope

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.380
three activities that
we had, especially

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.046
with the transportation--
I had the LTL.

00:29:05.046 --> 00:29:07.990
You have the air, the long
haul, the short hall, the ocean.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.744
Usually that's going to
be the same case, where

00:29:10.744 --> 00:29:13.160
the decision is going to be
whether I include that or not.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.200
And once you do, then you
need to account for 100%.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.402
You're saying, do I have
some operational control,

00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:20.980
or is this fitting
within what I consider

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.980
my company's boundaries?

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.855
In which case, I'm going
to account for them.

00:29:23.855 --> 00:29:25.640
And when I've decided
to account for them,

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.360
you have to sort of go
ahead and take all of them.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.760
They don't contribute a whole
lot to the overall carbon

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.260
footprints.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.552
So a lot of times, you
may spend a lot of time

00:29:36.552 --> 00:29:38.010
making these sort
of decisions that

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.790
turn out to be a pretty
small case overall.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.969
For some companies, it can
be a pretty large share

00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:43.760
of their emissions.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.010
And this is generally for the
transportation and distribution

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.510
environment.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.054
We'll talk about all
the other scope three.

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:52.440
AUDIENCE: My question's
about not putting it

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.530
in between percentages.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.320
Couldn't it be OK to put,
I don't know, a 10% or 15%

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.870
just to pressure the company
into starting relationships

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.833
with your suppliers and trying
to talk over these topics.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.840
If not, there's no pressure,
and you're just like, OK,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.610
it's fine.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.880
I don't care.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.000
PROFESSOR: So it's almost
two separate issues, right?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.170
Whether do we want to account
for the-- you're my supplier.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.640
You provide
transportation service.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.610
Do I want to account
for your emissions

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.860
within my corporate
carbon footprint,

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.610
within my organization boundary?

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.920
And that's a yes or no
decision in that sense.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.930
I should include these.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.720
Especially for the
transportation,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.640
when we talk about
operational control,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.040
that's very hard to separate.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.587
If you're a carrier that
I have a contract with

00:30:46.587 --> 00:30:49.170
and I'm telling you, take this
truckload of goods from point A

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.610
to point B, it's your
truck and your driver.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.520
But I'm the one that's
made that decision

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.400
to send those truckloads.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.830
So a lot of
companies-- we'll see

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.640
in a bit about what
percentage of companies

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.130
start to account for
these different things.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.820
But a lot of
companies would feel

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.910
that that's their emissions,
especially when it's

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.110
going from my factory to my
DC or something like that.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.830
I would maybe consider
that part of my selection.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.400
So that's generally yes or
no-- I'm going to include these

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:14.916
or I'm not.

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.290
And if I'm going
to include them,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.860
then you usually
are going to include

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.220
100%, because part
of this is that it's

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.280
trying to be a standard.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.480
So it's trying to apply a
certain set of principles

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.250
and have companies
follow it, because

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.500
while different companies
may make different decisions

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.470
about what they include
or not, you start

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.720
getting into a really gray
area when you start saying,

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.450
well, I'm including
these, but I'm only

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:41.000
going to include 8%, 15%, 25%.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.660
So as to the answer of
which is the correct one,

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.800
there really isn't one.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.130
So if we look
through what it means

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.000
to do the corporate
carbon footprint,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.550
it typically starts
with defining

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.470
your organizational
boundary or what method

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.928
you're going to
use to define that.

00:31:55.928 --> 00:31:59.480
And once you've done that, it
all starts to flow from that.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.465
And there's usually a
minimum standard slide.

00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:04.800
So if you look at the greenhouse
gas protocol, they say,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.672
in order to follow
our standard, you

00:32:06.672 --> 00:32:08.130
take this approach
of deciding what

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.547
your organizational boundary is.

00:32:09.547 --> 00:32:11.755
And then you must account
for the scope one and scope

00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:12.780
two emissions, right?

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.240
So once you've decided that
organizational boundary, scope

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.730
one and scope two, you
have to include it.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.550
The scope three
tend to be optional.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.590
And so it's up to the
company to decide.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.325
And I think most people would
say it's the more scope three

00:32:24.325 --> 00:32:26.450
you include the better so
that you're bringing more

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.420
into-- more of them become
your responsibility.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.810
You start taking more care about
what you're doing with those.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.090
But there's no
requirement that says you

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.370
have to for most scope three.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.950
There's also one
other issue, which

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.731
is that for some
regulatory issues,

00:32:42.731 --> 00:32:44.980
you may actually even choose
something less than this.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:50.041
So the California Air Resources
Board has regulations.

00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:52.290
There's different regional
greenhouse gas initiatives.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.250
If you're operating
in Europe, you

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.540
may have things
where you're required

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.460
to report on emissions
that happened in a even

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.540
smaller boundary, right?

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.570
So California might be just
in the state of California.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.460
Or if you're involved in the
EU Emissions Trading Scheme,

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.810
you might have some emissions
that occur just in the EU.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.320
And you might report
even a subset of these

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.650
that fall within that boundary.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.950
So there's a lot
of different ways

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.700
of how we dice up what the
company's carbon footprint is.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.310
So that's sort of
the first thing

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.070
to look for is when a company
starts reporting and starts

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.400
making announcements of this.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.150
How much information do they
give about what they included?

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.850
And can you start looking
at where those emissions

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.130
in the supply chain came from.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.380
AUDIENCE: Change the standard
to make it a little more

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.021
uniformed in terms of
people should report on this

00:33:38.021 --> 00:33:39.763
to try to make the
numbers make a little

00:33:39.763 --> 00:33:42.645
more sense for companies
across a certain industry?

00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:43.270
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.800
So a couple things.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.440
So one is, it's
basically they're

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.180
trying to take
accounting principles

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.501
and just apply them to carbon.

00:33:52.501 --> 00:33:54.750
And it's hard enough getting
the accounting principles

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.910
worked out, which is why you
get all sorts of obscure rules

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.900
and different companies making
different choices about what

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.840
they include and
where they include it.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.550
So the greenhouse
gas protocol has

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.659
taken the approach of a
generic standard that will work

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:10.848
for a lot of different uses.

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.389
And what you'll find
is that then you

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.080
might have different programs,
that if you want to participate

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.074
in this program,
they might specify

00:34:17.074 --> 00:34:18.949
certain rules that, say,
you're going to have

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.610
to do this or this or this.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:25.000
So voluntary climate, carbon
exchanges, things like that.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.770
They might decide that you must
take this approach to doing it

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.540
and then you must
include these emissions.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.139
So it's more that there are
many different programs.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.690
And the greenhouse gas
protocol is one standard

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.810
and sort of more of
a framework perhaps

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.400
to think about how we would
go through doing this.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.679
It's the most widely used one.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.326
If you look at, for example,
the Carbon Disclosure Project,

00:34:45.326 --> 00:34:47.659
which is collecting all this
information from companies,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.309
they usually ask them
what they're using,

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:52.949
or what approach did
you use to do this.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:56.960
And it's something like 90-plus
percent of companies that use

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.320
the greenhouse gas protocol.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.370
And typically that means scope
one, scope two, scope three.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.290
They specify that they use
operational control equity

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.355
share and things like that.

00:35:08.355 --> 00:35:19.220
AUDIENCE: So suppose [INAUDIBLE]
scope three or [INAUDIBLE] 25%.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.720
It should be scope one
for the first response.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.290
So we'll [INAUDIBLE]
twice, or is that 25%?

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:31.130
PROFESSOR: So this is where
it gets into different--

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:38.310
so generally, a program
has money at stake, right?

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.420
Then a lot of times they're very
concerned with double counting,

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.380
so especially when
you reduce things.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.760
So if you're under the Emissions
Trading Scheme or things

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.384
like that, you want to make sure
two separate organizations are

00:35:50.384 --> 00:35:53.420
not taking credit for, say, the
same reduction or not counting

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.330
it twice.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.360
So in that sense, if
you're participating

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.462
in a program like
that, it might say--

00:35:58.462 --> 00:36:00.420
and this is how most of
the regulatory programs

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.570
work-- you only report
scope one emissions.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.820
So they're actually going
after the power companies,

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.460
refineries, the main
manufacturing plants,

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.965
and not getting down to the
level of individual cares.

00:36:11.965 --> 00:36:14.590
It's starting to move that way,
especially as transportation is

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.330
added in the EU Trading Scheme.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:20.260
But that usually then
takes a different approach

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.260
to what it means, right?

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.520
So you would likely
report specifically

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.120
to the EU Trading Scheme based
on their requirements for it.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.520
And what you do as sort of
your own corporate disclosure,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.340
whether in your CSR reports or
something else, it's up to you

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:33.900
to include.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.060
So both of you may be
claiming the same emissions.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.760
But in general, the question
is whether that's a problem

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760
or not.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.010
And if there's no money or
anything changing hands,

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.820
there's not a defined
financial payment going on,

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.330
it's usually not a problem to
include the double counting,

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.150
because you have two companies
taking responsibility for it

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.451
and trying to work through this.

00:36:55.451 --> 00:36:55.950
But yeah.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.870
So all the emissions at some
point are somebody's scope one.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:03.790
Somebody burned the fuel or
did whatever to produce it.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:04.290
OK.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.347
So in terms of the
carbon footprint.

00:37:07.347 --> 00:37:09.180
Even with the standards
and things in place,

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.763
there's a lot of
discretion about what

00:37:10.763 --> 00:37:12.680
a company can include.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.516
The more important
thing is to recognize

00:37:14.516 --> 00:37:16.140
how you draw an
organizational boundary

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.050
and then sort of what
you have to report,

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.640
whether it's through a
program or a standard

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.090
or these minimum requirements.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:28.360
The other thing is-- so
on the emission sources,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.890
because especially when we
get into this idea of that

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.950
if you're a program, you have to
report scope one or scope two.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:36.264
Identifying where
they are is going

00:37:36.264 --> 00:37:38.180
to be sort of an important
piece and typically

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.638
when you report
admissions, they're

00:37:39.638 --> 00:37:42.440
going to ask you to report them
broken out by scope one, scope

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.680
two, and scope three.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.640
So if we look at
the supply chain

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.460
and these different sources
of emissions in here,

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.593
where are the scope one
emissions going to be?

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.156
AUDIENCE: Scope
one is going to be

00:37:58.156 --> 00:38:00.620
the direct emissions
from both factories

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.032
and the emissions from the
trucks that we actually own.

00:38:03.032 --> 00:38:03.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.910
So we're going to have
our private fleet.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.260
We own these trucks, so
the admissions they burn

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.460
are direct emissions.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.250
We have the Michigan
plant, which we own.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.980
So those direct emissions are
going to be our scope one.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.130
And then these
would be scope one,

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.680
provided we are considering
the Shanghai plant to be part

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.935
of our organizational boundary.

00:38:21.935 --> 00:38:25.400
If we excluded it, then those
would moved to scope three.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.350
And it may be that if we took
that equity share approach,

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.760
50% of them would be
scope one and 50% of them

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.940
would be scope three.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.880
So perhaps a little confusing
from the reporting standpoint.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.700
But usually it follows straight
through from the nature

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.610
of the activity that's
going on and where

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.860
it happens in relation to
my organizational boundary.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.972
So our scope two.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.134
AUDIENCE: The electricity
in the plants as well as

00:38:51.134 --> 00:38:52.452
the distribution center?

00:38:52.452 --> 00:38:53.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.910
So are the other source of
electricity we have is that

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.350
the retailer, since we
have those big depot.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.954
We have those dedicated
shared spaces.

00:39:04.954 --> 00:39:06.620
That's usually not
something that you're

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.162
going to have direct control
over, operational control

00:39:09.162 --> 00:39:09.870
over and whatnot.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.720
And it's not an equity share
or not a stake in the company.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.770
So that electricity is generally
going to go under the scope

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.930
three, which scope three
is everything that's

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.120
not scope one and scope two.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.750
So it all pretty much
comes out in the wash

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.666
once you've done that.

00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:25.860
So the important thing
is to identify what

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.390
our scope one and scope two is.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.080
And again, that just comes
straightforward from the nature

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.540
of the emissions
and where it falls

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.040
within your
organizational boundary.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.620
AUDIENCE: For this, when
would you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.660
PROFESSOR: So that's a decision
you would make before you even

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.060
started the exercise, would
be to the right thing to do,

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:50.560
right?

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.420
Is to decide what the
first step in the process

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.549
is, to decide what your
approach is going to be.

00:39:56.549 --> 00:39:57.590
AUDIENCE: Just wondering.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so then I
would divide the emissions.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.379
So in your worksheet, it won't
work that way, because I only

00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:04.850
gave you one column to do it.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.160
But then I would report
50% of those as scope one,

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.700
50% of these as scope
two, and the other 50%

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.660
of each as scope three.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.370
So this is what the share of
scope one, scope two, and scope

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.810
three emissions look like,
from what people reported.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.855
Some a little thrown off,
because if you miscalculated

00:40:23.855 --> 00:40:27.840
it a little bit, then the
ocean shipment or the LTL

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.520
might have contributed
a vast majority.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.280
Most of you included some
manner of scope three

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.540
in the carbon footprint.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.030
A few at least didn't, right?

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.770
So you could.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.160
There's no reason that
you would necessarily

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.785
have to include all
of the scope three.

00:40:42.785 --> 00:40:44.720
So you could easily
exclude those.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.020
So that's one thing
to keep track of,

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.690
is when we look at the
corporate carbon footprint,

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.230
scope three is the green.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.650
For most of you, it was pretty
small, because we were only

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.790
looking at-- in terms
of that worksheet,

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.040
we were only looking at
things like the transportation

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.132
and the distribution.

00:41:00.132 --> 00:41:02.590
But as we'll talk about in a
minute, that's not necessarily

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.330
really be the case in reality.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.850
But in terms of what
we report, that's

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.925
what I saw from
what you guys did.

00:41:09.925 --> 00:41:12.050
So this is data from the
Carbon Disclosure Project,

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.640
where they looked at--
this is from, I think,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.220
the 2014 reports.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.810
So this would have
been companies

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.540
that reported their
emissions to the CDP

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.980
in 2013 out of the
Financial Times 500.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.970
And it was asking
them percentage

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.920
of companies reporting scope
three categories and how much

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.420
the emissions were by category.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:36.390
So this is saying, for
a category like business

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.380
travel out of the 500
companies surveyed

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.710
or whatever, almost 80% of
them reported the emissions

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.950
from business travel in their
carbon footprint estimate.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:51.240
So you could tell that's
by far the highest.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.050
And some of the things
that drive these

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.672
are-- whether you include
it, whether you consider it

00:41:56.672 --> 00:41:58.880
really part of your business,
and generally if you're

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.830
sending your
employees on travel,

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.587
you would consider
those your missions.

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:04.920
That's things that you're doing.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.710
You had control over that.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.350
Even though they flew on
United Airlines or whatever,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.290
it's something that
you had control

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.510
of whether to decide
to send them on travel.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.580
So you sort of feel a
responsibility to include that.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.376
That was clearly much
higher than all of the rest.

00:42:21.376 --> 00:42:23.750
if you look down into getting
some of these other things,

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:31.190
like investments, end of
life of sold products.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:35.510
Only 10% maybe of
companies reported that.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.560
And they have some data.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.360
Now, the problem on
this is these bars

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.060
are representing how much
the actual emissions were.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.380
So the company's accounted
for their business travel.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.480
But it's basically an
infinitesimal share

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.210
of what's included.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.100
Part of this is
driven by how easy

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.010
it is to get this
sort of data, right?

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.760
Your airline will happily
sell you a carbon credit

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.870
when you go to buy it.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.750
Most of them well.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:04.760
But if you go back, I did a
corporate carbon footprint

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.500
with a large retailer.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.480
And they have all of
this information sitting

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.630
in their travel database.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.240
So they just dump
it out and say,

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.030
here's every flight every
employee took from this city

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.010
to that city, how far
it was, et cetera.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.690
So it's very easy to
calculate some of these.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.490
Figuring out what happened
to the end of life

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.770
of every single product
you sold, right?

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:27.250
Pretty difficult to track
down and get that information.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.480
So probably explains why
less companies did it.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.110
And then you look at, only
20% percent of companies

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.480
reported, say, on the use
of their sold products.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.820
But you saw
magnitude-wise it's more

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.365
than basically every
other category added up

00:43:42.365 --> 00:43:44.430
on the ones that did include it.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.290
So part of the thing
with scope three

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.470
is that it's always sort of
at your discretion of what

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:51.310
to include.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:55.290
And the decision that
drives it within companies

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.820
is not necessarily
how important it

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.560
is but a lot of times how easy
it is to get that information.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.490
And also how much
responsibility you feel.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.644
Do you feel that what
happens to the end of life

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:09.310
of your products is
your responsibility?

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:11.090
Or do you consider
that the consumer's,

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.917
the one that decides
whether to recycle it

00:44:12.917 --> 00:44:14.250
or throw it away or do whatever.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.934
So maybe you decide
that's not emissions

00:44:15.934 --> 00:44:17.725
that you want to consider
in your boundary,

00:44:17.725 --> 00:44:19.710
because you don't have the
direct control over it.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.270
Whereas employee
travel, that's something

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:22.311
you do have control over.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:25.170
OK.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.503
Any questions about the scopes?

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.584
OK, just to recap some of the
mechanics of carbon footprints,

00:44:35.584 --> 00:44:38.000
the first step-- determining
your organizational boundary,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.500
right?

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.520
And generally, that
starts with deciding what

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.510
approach you're going to take.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.426
And probably you want
to decide that and think

00:44:43.426 --> 00:44:44.784
about it ahead of time.

00:44:44.784 --> 00:44:46.450
The greenhouse gas
protocol spends a lot

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.650
of time talking
about aligning this

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:50.680
with your financial and
accounting reporting.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.870
So it probably makes sense,
especially a large company

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.380
publicly traded, that when
you're going to go through it,

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.880
it makes sense to go through
and set this up in the same way

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.890
that you've got your
accounting system set up

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.210
to make that process
a little bit easier.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.430
Once you've got the
organizational boundary set up,

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:07.846
then you need to
start determining

00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:09.370
your operational boundary.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.790
So anything that's in your
organizational boundary that's

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:17.079
scope one or scope two of
your operations, that's

00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:18.870
the things you're going
to have to include.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.170
But then you need
to identify which

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.378
of the scope three emissions
you're going to include.

00:45:22.378 --> 00:45:26.220
And generally, the
decision of this

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.840
should generally be
separate from the decision

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.770
of actually gathering
the data or doing

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:31.964
the emission, in theory.

00:45:31.964 --> 00:45:33.630
In practice, they're
related because you

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.255
might want to include
something but you

00:45:35.255 --> 00:45:36.430
can't get the data on it.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.652
But otherwise, you're
looking at the situation of,

00:45:39.652 --> 00:45:41.110
I'm going to measure
the emissions,

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.300
and then I'm going to
include all the ones that

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.020
are really small.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.630
I'm not going to include
the ones that are big.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.190
So generally you can think of
these as a set of principles

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.480
of sort of work down in order.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.271
So you're going to
decide whether something

00:45:50.271 --> 00:45:51.475
should be included or not.

00:45:51.475 --> 00:45:52.850
Then once you make
that decision,

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:57.100
go out and do the work to gather
the data and calculate it.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.393
And finally, once
you've decided what's in

00:45:59.393 --> 00:46:01.420
and what's out, what
you're including, running

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.280
out and gathering
the data and getting

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.240
the appropriate emissions
factors from it.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.840
So this is usually
the tricky part

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.897
of going through and figuring
out all those facilities, all

00:46:11.897 --> 00:46:14.230
that transportation, anything
related to the scope three

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.380
and getting that
data, because they

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.610
tend to come for a lot of
different data sources,

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.770
if you think about who knows.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.270
Again, a lot of
times if you've paid

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.290
the bill for it--
electricity, fuel,

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:27.860
things like that--
it's pretty easy

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.490
to track down a little more.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:31.110
But as you start
getting into it,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.140
if you wanted to
talk about the waste

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.290
that you're generating at your
facilities, the transportation

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.500
where you're trying to get.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.390
How far did things go?

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.584
What sort of mode did I use?

00:46:42.584 --> 00:46:44.250
You have to start
going out to basically

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.920
all the different parts
of your organization

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.128
to start gathering that
data, because there's usually

00:46:48.128 --> 00:46:50.650
not a single repository
where that is.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.360
So the big pain for
a lot of companies

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.720
is that it's a very manual
process at this stage,

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.890
because you're pulling from
the transportation management

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.000
system, your warehouse
data or your facilities.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.950
You're getting from
the facilities manager.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.950
Your procurement
group is the one

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.530
that knows what you're buying
and who you're buying it from,

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.800
where it's coming from.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.590
And so usually they're going to
dump all that data to an Excel

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.548
spreadsheet or an Access
database and something

00:47:13.548 --> 00:47:15.435
like that, and somebody
in your organization

00:47:15.435 --> 00:47:17.310
is going to get stuck
with the responsibility

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.240
for taking all of
that, translating it

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.360
into the calculations.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.560
If you look at the
GHC protocol, they

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.110
have a bunch of
calculation tools.

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.330
They're just spreadsheets.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:31.070
So it's still a very manual
process at this stage.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:33.660
Big ERP vendors and things
like that will happily

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.640
include some of this carbon
calculation in there.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.450
So there's a move to try to
get some of this automated.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.870
But that's one of the
big barriers right now,

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.769
is that it usually
just takes some time

00:47:47.769 --> 00:47:49.810
to get it up and get it
running within a company,

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.851
to figure out the processes
for how you calculate

00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:55.275
the data, what format it comes
in, who does the calculation,

00:47:55.275 --> 00:47:57.760
and how you report
it, et cetera.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.970
So as part of that data,
integrity is a big issue,

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:04.210
because you have different
people that don't necessarily

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.180
know the overall picture,
calculating, pulling the data

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.630
for their bit, sending it in.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.630
The biggest problem I
run into in doing these

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:12.880
are missing values.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.189
So you go to one of your
distribution centers,

00:48:15.189 --> 00:48:16.730
and they come back
with a report that

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:20.030
said they used electricity, fuel
oil, natural gas, refrigerants,

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.864
all of this.

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.530
Your other facility
comes back and says,

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:24.680
here's our electricity bills.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.180
Are they missing
all of this data,

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.530
or did they really just
not use any of that.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:34.160
So making sure the data
you're getting is complete.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.660
Aggregation issues, right?

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.032
So we saw this.

00:48:38.032 --> 00:48:39.490
I'll look through
your spreadsheets

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.740
a little bit at greater detail.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.620
But when I went through
it and did this--

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.935
so if we look at the data
that we gave you in this,

00:48:45.935 --> 00:48:48.060
we had a bunch of data
about the shipment you sent,

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.520
x number of shipments by air.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.020
You knew the average weight
of all the shipments you sent.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.980
But we didn't have it broken
out by specific modes.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.840
So when I did it, I just
used the average weight

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.040
of the shipment times
the number of shipments

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.092
times the average distance
I had for those modes.

00:49:05.092 --> 00:49:07.550
It doesn't make sense that my
average air shipment is going

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:10.650
to be 11,000 kilograms and that
my average truckload shipment

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:11.600
was going to be that.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.770
Probably sending my air
shipments by a few hundred

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:16.430
kilograms at a
time, I'm probably

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:21.140
sending the truckload right
by that 20 tons or so.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.099
So once you've got
the data, figuring out

00:49:24.099 --> 00:49:26.640
what you can do with it, how
you get it out in the right way,

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.880
to sort of separate it
out can be an issue.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.470
Making sure you come up with
appropriate approximations.

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.880
And finally, finding the
right emissions factors.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.360
One of the big things--
pay attention to units.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.687
Everybody will report
back in different numbers,

00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:43.270
especially if you're
a global company.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.770
You're going to get
natural gas back

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.640
in therms, cubic feet, cubic
meters, joules, whatever.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.850
So figuring out the units
that everybody's using

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:56.460
and make sure that you convert
those to the appropriate way.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.940
And apply a consistent
set of emissions factors.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.550
Especially on things
like electricity,

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.008
you're going to be
able to break it

00:50:02.008 --> 00:50:06.330
down by the country
level, regional levels,

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.730
by where the grid is.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.993
You can find information at
the state level, even some

00:50:09.993 --> 00:50:11.440
at the municipality level.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.940
The question is,
what you don't want

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.810
to get caught doing is cherry
picking the right commission's

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:16.310
factors.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:20.535
So in areas where they
use a lot of nuclear,

00:50:20.535 --> 00:50:21.910
I'm going to use
my local factor.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.460
And when I'm in an area that
gets its energy from coal,

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.600
I'm going to use my national
factory to sort of keep me

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.160
from ever looking too bad.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.880
So those are just some of
the tricks going in with it.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.052
So one thing is absolute
versus relative measures.

00:50:42.052 --> 00:50:44.010
All of this carbon
footprint data in this sense

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.890
is getting reported at
the aggregate level.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.720
That's what's important on a
national or a global scale,

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.910
right?

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.630
How much total carbon are we
pumping into the atmosphere?

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:55.400
But for our company, especially
as your business is growing,

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.510
you probably want to also have
some kind of relative measure,

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:02.970
like in there, we were just
measuring per kilogram, as

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:03.470
well.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.990
Just to understand, are you
getting more efficient or not?

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.990
Because as your business
changes, either growing

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:10.460
or shrinking, that's going to
change your aggregate level

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.030
of emissions.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:13.886
But you may actually be getting
more efficient at the same time

00:51:13.886 --> 00:51:16.260
that you're producing more
aggregate levels of emissions.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.890
So you probably want to
have some other measures

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:23.670
that you calculate in
addition to the absolute one.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.360
And expected carbon footprint
will be refined over time.

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.150
The main use of these things
is to compare an organization's

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.480
year-on-year performance.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.340
So you're picking some
year as a baseline year

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.470
and trying to measure how
you're doing from that.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.720
Most companies are going to
set some target that says,

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.380
we want to be at 80% of 1994
levels or something like that.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.970
As your organization
changes, as you

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.550
make acquisitions, as you sell
off pieces, a lot of times

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.008
you're going to have to go back
and restate previous years'

00:51:50.008 --> 00:51:53.210
emissions so that you can keep
that consistent baseline going.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.719
As the emissions factors
change over time,

00:51:55.719 --> 00:51:57.885
you may have to go back and
revisit old calculations

00:51:57.885 --> 00:51:59.020
and things like that.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.680
So just be aware
that, if you're trying

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.220
to do this for the goal
of comparing year on year,

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.900
expect to occasionally
have to go back

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.870
and think about what your
previous year's emissions

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.411
actually were in comparison to
what your business looks like.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:17.060
So that's the main thing about
the organizational carbon

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.560
footprint.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.420
But it doesn't really get
into the other big issues,

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.130
which is, what do you do
once you have them, right?

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.386
So how many of you
would disclose?

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.490
So what are the reasons
that you would disclose?

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:40.370
AUDIENCE: That if
you were higher

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.930
than your competitor,
the disclosure

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.990
to the list itself
is probably more

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:50.600
of a specific group of users
who are consuming that data.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.730
So it's probably not going to
hurt your consumer base, even

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.760
if you are a little bit higher
and it probably sets you up

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.750
to be maybe a more
transparent organization

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.080
in the eyes of the people
who reviewed this data.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.880
So I sort of thought,
well, as long

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.990
as you don't have any egregious
numbers in there, that it

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.750
probably can only help you.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.070
And the general
public isn't probably

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.526
going to see this data anyway.

00:53:16.852 --> 00:53:18.560
AUDIENCE: If you
disclose, even if you're

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.105
higher than your
competitor, it gives you

00:53:21.105 --> 00:53:25.940
an opportunity to win the
Most Improved award over time.

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.979
And a lot of these
numbers don't really

00:53:27.979 --> 00:53:29.470
mean anything to consumers.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.310
So you're able to do so
much business market.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.040
So if you're able to
have a headline that

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.414
says you decreased your carbon
footprint in your products

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:42.565
by x percentage, that could
actually fall apart there.

00:53:42.565 --> 00:53:47.585
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think not
disclosing would [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:47.585 --> 00:53:51.370
worse, because then people might
assume that you're-- though you

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.640
might be actually worse than
your competitor, by disposing,

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.888
you set it up where you
can defend that and say,

00:53:56.888 --> 00:53:59.352
but we're improving and
these are the reasons,

00:53:59.352 --> 00:54:01.685
rather than not disclosing,
which they could just assume

00:54:01.685 --> 00:54:02.826
you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:02.826 --> 00:54:05.760
That's why [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that probably what

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.810
the other company
ended up doing is

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:11.420
defining a very limited scope.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.760
So in terms of
comparing the two,

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.820
I think it's not a debate
about what the script should be

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.965
and how each compare
to the two companies.

00:54:20.965 --> 00:54:25.410
So for me, not realizing
the data was even worse,

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.201
that means that they'll
give you a paper.

00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:27.700
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.251
PROFESSOR: Who
would not disclose?

00:54:38.897 --> 00:54:42.800
Is it because
FerretCo was so low?

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.436
Most of your submissions
indicated that as the reason.

00:54:47.436 --> 00:54:48.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.845
So it's assumed that
there's so much discretion

00:54:50.845 --> 00:54:53.960
applied to the figures.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.920
I just computed that.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.120
It was impossible for an
uninformed person looking

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.372
at the numbers to know
what went into the number.

00:55:02.372 --> 00:55:06.110
And so to the
uninformed, they might

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:10.710
think that he's comparing apples
to apples, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:12.702
So that's why.

00:55:12.702 --> 00:55:16.437
AUDIENCE: I think the
customers' perspective would

00:55:16.437 --> 00:55:27.144
be [INAUDIBLE] the
carbon footprint.

00:55:27.144 --> 00:55:32.124
So I thought it would be like
[INAUDIBLE] to publish this

00:55:32.124 --> 00:55:34.116
just out of the
blue and impossibly,

00:55:34.116 --> 00:55:38.100
because the competitor would
have just published theirs.

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.130
And I think the company
might not already

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.130
be ready to actually
publish them,

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:46.330
because they were not
ready also to take action

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.904
on their manufacturing
or operations

00:55:48.904 --> 00:55:51.264
to actually reduce this problem.

00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:55.520
So I think that I would
have delayed [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.721
I would have delayed
the disclosure.

00:55:57.721 --> 00:56:00.610
The time to come
out with a strategy

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:04.200
and figure out what we can
do to reduce to which part

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.420
we can reduce and to which
part we can make neutral

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.980
make an announcement
that we're moving

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.270
on that half and
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:18.440
2015 and to be carbon neutral
in 2020 based on our strategy,

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.800
and then move from there.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.960
But I don't think I would have
just put the number of there

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.910
without making sure in the
company that what we can do

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:30.154
and making sure that it's
communicating properly.

00:56:30.154 --> 00:56:30.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.920
So if we look at
what's driving this,

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.060
the carbon disclosure project
is probably the most widely done

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.920
of public disclosure
programs, right?

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.382
And so this is data
from the 2012 report,

00:56:44.382 --> 00:56:45.840
which is the most
recent one that I

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.940
could find this graph for.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.410
So when they started this
in 2003, right there.

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.330
This is out of the
top 500 companies

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:53.840
in the world, 500
largest companies.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.650
They were getting less
than a 50% response rate.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:02.100
And I think they might
have even [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:05.470
But that's pretty much steadily
grown over time until now.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:07.654
It's pretty much hovering
around the 80% level

00:57:07.654 --> 00:57:09.570
that it's been there for
the last three years.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.990
So most of the big companies
are going ahead and disclosing

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:16.390
the emissions, probably
because this is driven

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.190
by institutional investors.

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:22.030
So essentially they get
mutual funds and other people

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.180
to sign on to this.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.310
So it's being driven by
investors [INAUDIBLE],

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.054
not end consumers.

00:57:28.054 --> 00:57:29.470
And you have the
same sort of deal

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.303
with that the
business-to-business pressure.

00:57:31.303 --> 00:57:35.910
Most companies
somewhere in their CSR

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:38.700
or in their organization
have maybe some requirements

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.290
where they're asking
their suppliers

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.980
to do this sort of
thing, to report on it.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.170
A lot of them are not
yet penalizing you

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:46.090
if you don't do it.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:48.019
But they're starting to
ask, and enough people

00:57:48.019 --> 00:57:49.810
are starting to ask
that most companies are

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:51.190
starting to respond.

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:54.050
The end consumer, the average
consumer I do not think

00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:56.840
is paying much attention to
whether a company has reported

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.450
its carbon footprint or not.

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:02.500
And even companies that
don't respond to this

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.780
may be disclosing this
information on their websites

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.270
or things like that.

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:09.984
And the other thing
is that some of this

00:58:09.984 --> 00:58:12.400
depends on when these companies
started thinking about it,

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.530
to your point of the
first time you get it,

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.520
it may not be the right
time to disclose that.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.630
You might want to
wait a little bit.

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:21.470
One of the companies
that we did this with,

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:25.210
I think we did it with
them back in 2006.

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.140
And they didn't start
reporting until 2011.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.430
So, I mean, there's five
years between when they first

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:31.930
did their corporate
carbon footprint

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.940
and when they
started answering it.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.880
And actually at the time when
we went and did it for them,

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.880
they didn't even know they
were getting this survey.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.380
And so I went and
looked at their--

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.040
you can actually track
companies' responses over time

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.230
on the CDP, and you
can go back and look.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.610
And for the first
four or five years,

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:53.180
they had a mix of just didn't
respond or declined to respond.

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:57.940
And their VPs of supply
chain, their CSR person,

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.537
their communications director,
and marketing-- none of them

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:04.120
even knew that they were getting
this and declining it, right?

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.380
So I don't know who
it was going to,

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.550
but somebody in the organization
was taking it and throwing it

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:08.150
away.

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:12.570
So part of this comes
down to getting this

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:13.820
within the organization.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.590
Just the process
of starting this

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.360
can be useful in terms
of getting the ball

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.360
rolling of understanding
where the emissions are

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.720
in your organization, how to
respond to these, giving you

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.136
time to start thinking about
how you're going to formulate

00:59:25.136 --> 00:59:28.190
a response to win, when
the pressure might start

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:29.460
mounting a little bit more.

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.709
Because the other thing that
these investors are doing

00:59:31.709 --> 00:59:34.470
is sort of pressuring the
SEC to make it a mandated

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.700
requirement in the
same way they might

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.070
disclose other financial
information or other

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:41.050
of their public
disclosures to start

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:43.770
releasing some of this
information, the mandatory SEC

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:44.270
filing.

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.280
So most companies would
prefer to avoid that.

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.520
So some of it could be seen
as a bit of risk mitigation

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.770
that if you disclose voluntarily
now and enough companies go

00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:55.400
along with this, you could avoid
the regulation that comes down

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:55.900
to it.

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.860
AUDIENCE: Do you think
there's industries

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.110
where there is way more
pressure to answer than ours?

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:09.030
Because my original
interest was doing Amazon.

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:10.320
They don't report it.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.530
And then it was looking for
comparables just in case

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:18.700
to see if I could find a
market leader in e-commerce.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.590
And I found no leaders in
that specific industry.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:26.040
So I don't know how that is--

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.800
PROFESSOR: So this is something
we've talked about informally

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.640
on our researcher.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.580
And part of this comes
from looking at-- OK,

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.630
so what happens if you
don't respond, right?

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.970
So eventually there's
enough buildup of pressure

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.500
to get boycotts or
things like that going.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:46.570
And the ability to withstand
the research on why do companies

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:48.620
give into these sort
of demands tends

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.880
to come down to the fact that,
one, it tends to be cheaper

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.140
just to do it, right?

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.690
You really just need an
intern and some people

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:58.430
to actually take the time
to pull this data together

01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:59.060
to do this.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.020
It's not that complicated.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.270
And most big companies
already have a department

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.970
that does the sort of thing.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:07.670
So the transaction
cost essentially

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:09.832
to do this is pretty
low, so they give in.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.290
The other thing
has to do with that

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.980
whether you're consumer-facing
and brand-oriented

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.252
or not and what your
market position is.

01:01:16.252 --> 01:01:17.960
And the stronger your
market position is,

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.990
the less you have to
care what people think.

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:22.480
So somebody like
Amazon, Apple, may not

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.480
feel that they necessarily
have to do this test.

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:31.000
And again, and
why did I measure?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.790
So one of things
to think about this

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.434
is that there's external
and internal reasons

01:01:35.434 --> 01:01:37.600
that you might want to do
this measure, the same way

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.100
that any accounting
system you might

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.980
have an external financial
reporting system.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.980
You might have your
internal managerial systems

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.110
that you use for
something different.

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:47.466
So most of this
tends to be to put it

01:01:47.466 --> 01:01:51.640
in a CSR report, investors
or customers asking for you.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.880
You might have
regulation to do it.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.370
You might also have some
internal ones to do it.

01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:00.331
If you're setting goals
internally in preparation

01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:01.830
for eventually
disclosing, you might

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:02.990
want to do this so
you can understand

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.460
where the carbon footprint is.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.380
You can set targets.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.950
You can start putting
requirements on your managers.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:09.447
You can figure
out where this is.

01:02:09.447 --> 01:02:11.530
The other thing to remember
is that the boundaries

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.710
we use for this don't
have to be the same.

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:16.386
So especially in the
internal business,

01:02:16.386 --> 01:02:17.760
you can include
whatever you want

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.100
to include in that measurement.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.380
So to help you drive
reductions at your suppliers,

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.377
you might have an
internal system

01:02:24.377 --> 01:02:26.710
where you grade managers and
your procurement department

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.180
of transportation.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.300
In terms of emissions,
that would be scope three.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.675
But at the same
time, you may not

01:02:31.675 --> 01:02:33.600
include those in your
external reports.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.566
So again, there's different
uses for the information.

01:02:37.566 --> 01:02:39.440
And depending on what
you want to do with it,

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.251
you might draw the
boundary in a separate way.

01:02:43.251 --> 01:02:43.750
All right.

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.125
So the other thing
is that I want

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:47.000
to cover before
I'll wrap up here

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.930
is, does it make sense to
compare WidgetCo and FerretCo.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.160
We saw FerretCo
55,000 tons, right?

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.100
Very small.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:58.880
And so the question is, is it
worthwhile to compare companies

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.960
that are direct
competitors to each other,

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.960
but because of their
operations, they

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.620
may be doing
something differently?

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:09.220
So I actually the Ferret
company numbers, actually-- I

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.410
made a fake supply chain
with data the same way

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:16.880
I did for the [INAUDIBLE]
from WidgetCo.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.710
They use contract manufacturers,
as opposed to owning

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:21.960
their own manufacturer plants.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.750
And I just assumed that they
have the same efficiency

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.770
as your Shanghai plant does.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:27.860
They produce less, right?

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.940
If you look at the numbers,
their revenues are lower.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.170
You sell about 84 million
kilograms of products.

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:35.930
They sold 50 million.

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:38.860
So they don't produce as much,
but their efficiency per unit

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.272
was the same here.

01:03:40.272 --> 01:03:42.730
I made up of supply chain where
they had a different model,

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:46.530
which is local sales offices
serving industrial consumers,

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:48.210
because they have a
longer supply chain,

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:50.960
because of all their
manufacturing goes on in Asia.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.820
I assume they used
ocean and then rail

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.520
and that they had a
network of 40 seas,

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.290
a bunch of local sales offices,
and then a local fleet that

01:03:58.290 --> 01:03:59.992
did the transportation there.

01:03:59.992 --> 01:04:02.200
So I actually figured out
what these numbers would be

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.940
and calculated.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.922
And that's where that
55,000 tons came up.

01:04:06.922 --> 01:04:08.130
The big issue, though, right?

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:11.306
If we looked at what I would
sort of consider WidgetCo's

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:12.680
boundary and what
most of you did

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.710
is that you're basically stuck
reporting on the Michigan

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.080
plant and the California
and Georgia, DC,

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.750
and your private fleet.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.620
Most of you included some
share of the Shanghai plant.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.700
And as we saw,
the emissions were

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.170
being driven by what's going
on at the manufacturing plant.

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:31.170
That was by far the largest
source of emissions.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.710
It was something like 85%
of the entire supply chain

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:35.390
emissions are coming in there.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:37.880
WidgetCo's using a
contract manufacturer.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.020
So none of this falls within
their scope one and scope two.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.951
They have a similar
distribution operation to you.

01:04:43.951 --> 01:04:45.700
I included their
distribution all the way,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.240
their transportation all the way
up to the industrial customers

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.820
that they have.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.230
But when we do it this way,
we draw different boundaries

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:56.040
that allows them to
exclude this piece.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.760
Since they don't know
it, they're buying.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.926
They don't even necessarily
have operational control

01:04:59.926 --> 01:05:02.560
if they're just doing contracts
with different manufacturers

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.860
to do it along the way.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.414
So this is what happens is
that, under these different

01:05:07.414 --> 01:05:09.830
definitions of what we might
consider in the supply chain,

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:10.970
we're going to get
different numbers.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:11.700
And one of the
things to remember

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.520
is FerretCo's always going to
have a smaller looking number

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.090
just because they
sell less goods.

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:21.080
So I did at sort of the smallest
level, the corporate level,

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:26.725
which is down into that 370,
level 370-some thousand tons.

01:05:26.725 --> 01:05:30.490
If WidgetCo does that,
it's 4.51 per unit.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.250
FerretCo's is about
48,000 and 0.95.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:37.110
This is what I-- saying
I was publicly disclosed,

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:40.280
which I was going to include
the equity share of what goes on

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.730
at Shanghai.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.580
FerretCo, that's their
disclosed number.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.246
That includes some
of those scope three,

01:05:45.246 --> 01:05:47.410
and that's what I
gave you in the case.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.890
But if we look at
the supply chain,

01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:51.370
if we look at this end-to-end
to what it takes rather

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.490
than ignore who owns
what, their emissions

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:57.320
are still going to be less.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.480
But on a per unit basis, I
came up with a higher number.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.561
So this is what a lot of
you got to in your write-ups

01:06:03.561 --> 01:06:04.185
and discussion.

01:06:04.185 --> 01:06:07.970
It is reporting at the
organizational level

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.880
makes you look worse
perhaps than FerretCo does,

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.160
if we're just disclosing
this carbon footprint.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.720
So when you're going
in and thinking

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.700
about that as a
disclosure strategy,

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.650
it's obviously something
you want to include.

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:23.470
And in this case,
a lot of companies

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:27.100
tend to want to be
less transparent.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.610
FerretCo might
disclose this number

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:29.920
and then say nothing
about it, knowing

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.220
that it's going to be low.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.100
So perhaps transparency is
your friend in this case.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.400
When you disclose
yours, you can say

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.169
we include these because we
own this, this, and this.

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:41.085
And then maybe when
somebody looks up FerretCo

01:06:41.085 --> 01:06:44.295
and they're trying to figure out
why their emissions are so low

01:06:44.295 --> 01:06:46.600
and they say, well, there's
no information available,

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.810
then they'll see that as there's
a push for more transparency

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:52.560
and they start having to
disclose perhaps what they're

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.860
including and what they're not.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.693
It starts to come to
light a little bit more

01:06:55.693 --> 01:06:57.810
that really it's
because they're doing

01:06:57.810 --> 01:07:01.590
different things in their
supply chain that you are.

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:04.730
Supply chain is very similar,
a little bit different

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.359
in terms of how they sell.

01:07:06.359 --> 01:07:08.400
But they're doing essentially
the same activities

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.790
for very similar products.

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.300
But it can produce a very
different corporate carbon

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.480
footprint depending on where
you draw those boundaries.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.260
And this is starting to
get a lot more attention.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.320
So this is data that
Apple released, right?

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.400
So they actually have
a lot of good data

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.521
about their environmental
impacts on their web page.

01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:29.020
But the thing that
they were showing

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.440
is that, out of their
total end-to-end everything

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.820
from the raw materials
that go into their products

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.210
to customer use and
ventral disposal,

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:40.560
Apple only owns 2% of those
emissions at their facilities.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.810
Everything else is outsourced.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:43.810
They have somebody else
doing the manufacturing.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.860
Somebody else is doing
the transportation.

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.310
Somebody else does the
raw materials, et cetera.

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:52.690
And yet, they won the Best
Supply Chain award from Gartner

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:53.990
for the last six years.

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:58.590
So the idea of the supply
chain is no longer the idea

01:07:58.590 --> 01:07:59.810
that I'm owning that.

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:01.830
They're managing all
of these activities,

01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:03.475
but they aren't
necessarily doing them

01:08:03.475 --> 01:08:04.600
in any of their facilities.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.690
So does it make
sense for me to try

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:11.120
to compare Apple against some
of these other companies.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.620
in the computer
space, they might be

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.930
competing against, say, Dell.

01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:16.260
Or in the phones, they
might deal with Samsung.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.080
Samsung has 240,000 employees,
40 manufacturing sites.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.160
They produce
refrigerators, washing

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.990
machines, all of these
things, in addition

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:27.790
to, say, the Galaxy Tab that
you might compare to the iPhone.

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:32.200
So does it really makes sense to
compare these sort of companies

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.830
together on the corporate level?

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:36.350
And the answer is
increasingly, no, it doesn't.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.439
And this is not
unusual for a company

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.890
to have a pretty low
amount of many emissions

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:42.359
being in their facilities.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:45.279
These researchers looked
across a wide range

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:48.189
of activities of manufacturers
of goods-- producers

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:49.960
of actual goods by industry.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.850
What percent of their emissions
were scope one and scope two?

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.130
And as you can see,
the top of the red line

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.550
is where the scope
one and scope two end.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.080
It can vary a bit.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.950
But on average, they
found it at around 25%.

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:05.540
So most companies, even the
ones that are producing goods,

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.149
do not own the majority of their
emissions in the supply chain.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:11.649
And so we're starting to see
expansion of the greenhouse gas

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:12.149
protocol.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:14.810
They've actually
created new standards.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:17.640
One is what they call
the value chain approach.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.130
So this is looking at
the entire supply chain,

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:24.050
from raw materials all the way
to product use and disposal,

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:25.790
and looking at it at
the aggregate level.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.040
So this is trying to say,
what are the total emissions

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.863
globally for everything
from beginning to end?

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:33.529
And what they've done is they've
identified different categories

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:36.149
and provided some guidance
on how you measure that.

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:38.420
And so companies can
now start to choose

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.290
which of these
categories they report.

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:45.600
I think they said only one
company has reported emissions

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.140
in all 14 of these
categories of what they have.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.189
So it's an ongoing
process as companies

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:52.540
try to help them include
more and more of this

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.820
so that we can start to see.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.720
This carbon Disclosure
Project started

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.260
something called the
CDB Supply Chain Report.

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.540
It was started by Dell, L'Oreal,
a couple other companies--

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.740
Walmart is now part of
it-- where they're actually

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.860
surveying their suppliers and
asking them the same questions

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.170
that are in the CDP.

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:14.200
And CDP manages it and
helps get those responses.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.410
The big thing to know is that
it started in 2008 with 1,402

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:20.510
suppliers contracted.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:23.690
It's grown to be
over 5,000 of them.

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:27.210
So more companies are doing this
with more of their suppliers.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.930
One of the big things is that
the more requests a company

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:34.520
gets for this from different
customers of theirs,

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.390
the more likely they
are to respond to it.

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.260
So as this pressure's
increasing,

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.840
starting to see more
companies willing to respond.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.530
And finally, to
set up what we're

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:46.580
going to talk about next time.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.620
There's also a huge
issue in protocol

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.300
has started a product standard.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.350
So what separates
a product standard

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:55.520
is that the value chain--
my company produces

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.580
many different products.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.709
I'm going to include
everything in the value chain.

01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:01.000
For all those, I'm going to
report aggregate emissions.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.050
The product level says, now
I'm going to instead focus.

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:06.690
I'm going to still do this end
to end upstream all the way

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:07.960
down to stream.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.441
But I'm going to focus
on one specific product.

01:11:10.441 --> 01:11:12.440
And I'm going to report
it at the product level.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.940
So when we talk about labeling--
would you put out a carbon

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.647
footprint of a
product on a label?--

01:11:18.647 --> 01:11:21.230
typically this product standard
is the kind of thing you would

01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:22.270
need to do.

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:24.510
And that includes
all of the emissions

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:25.500
from beginning to end.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.480
So that includes,
in our example,

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.152
we only talked about
the manufacturing,

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:29.860
the distribution.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.300
We didn't get into the raw
materials, the disposal,

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.800
all of these things
that go into it.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.910
So these is actually
what we're going

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:39.410
to talk about on Monday when
we talk about life cycle

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:42.040
assessment, which is basically
the methodology for how we go

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.180
into this at the product level.

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:49.200
So just as a recap for that, I
posted-- so essentially there,

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.150
I posted an actual report that
some colleagues here at MIT

01:11:52.150 --> 01:11:54.770
did that looked at
handwriting systems.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.661
They were looking at
that Dyson air blade

01:11:56.661 --> 01:11:58.910
to try to figure out whether
it's more environmentally

01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:01.020
friendly to do that than
have paper towels or some

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.936
of these other things.

01:12:01.936 --> 01:12:04.739
So for Monday, we're
asking you to read that.

01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:05.780
So it's a little bit dry.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.363
But there's lots of
tables and charts,

01:12:07.363 --> 01:12:09.542
so it should go
by fairly quickly.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.500
But it's a pretty good
example of what it takes

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.590
to get into the product level.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.320
And we'll use that for a
discussion about life cycle

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.620
assessment and what it
means for a company that

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.880
wants to do it at this level.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.830
And then next Wednesday,
we have Martin Wolf

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:24.560
from Seventh Generation
to talk about actually

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.270
how their company uses life
cycle assessment to make sure

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:30.460
all the products they're selling
are environmentally friendly.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.010
OK.

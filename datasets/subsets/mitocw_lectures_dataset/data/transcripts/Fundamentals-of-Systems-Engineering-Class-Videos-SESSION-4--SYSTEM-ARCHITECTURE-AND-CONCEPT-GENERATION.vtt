00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:26.300
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.100
So let's see.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.150
Mr. Sticky.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.740
Let's see, EPFL.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.130
Who picked Mr. Sticky?

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.840
Anybody?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.140
So the definition is a
cylindrical container

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.430
containing a date covered with
a [? basic ?] substance that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.600
can be deployed in order to
attract and capture insects.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.710
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.080
I'm glad you added the
last part because I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.060
was worried that
you weren't going

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.920
to talk about the function.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.890
So it's good.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.640
I think it's good.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.640
You started describing
the form, and then you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.050
explained what the
function is at the end.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.030
So that's good.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.900
Anybody else do Mr. Sticky here?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.400
Yeah.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.780
Do you want to share?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.310
AUDIENCE: So we said it
was a portable canister

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.730
deployable, fly-attracting
sticky tape,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.202
fly-catching mechanism.

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.887
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right.

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:26.720
Yeah, I think you've
got the right elements.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.140
I think it needs to
flow a little better,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.480
but you've got the
right ingredients there.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.790
What about the i3.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.950
Anybody?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.651
Yeah, go ahead.

00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.150
Justice.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.775
AUDIENCE: You said
it was an efficiency

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:43.287
and urban-optimized transport
vehicle made by BMW.

00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:44.620
OLIVIER DE WECK: Say that again?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.605
AUDIENCE: Can you turn
on the mic, please?

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:53.080
AUDIENCE: Does yours work?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.490
OLIVIER DE WECK: Do it again.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.240
AUDIENCE: We said
it was an efficiency

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.640
and urban-optimized transport
vehicle made by BMW.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.480
OLIVIER DE WECK: Urban-optimized
transport vehicle.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.275
I think it's good.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.699
I think you're
missing the effect

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.500
that it's an all-electric, the
fact that it's fundamentally

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.840
an electric vehicle.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.185
I think it's key to the i3.

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:20.810
Because you have you
have other urban--

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.050
like the smart car.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.640
And so architecturally,
distinguishing feature

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.300
is definitely the
electric drive.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.090
So I think it's
good, but I think

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.610
you're just missing a little
bit on the technology there.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.620
What about i3 and EPFL?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.850
Anybody do the i3?

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:39.565
AUDIENCE: Nobody.

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:41.410
OLIVIER DE WECK: Nobody.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.770
Anybody else here?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.898
Yeah, Veronica.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:46.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.600
Sorry.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.200
A transportation system
responsible for moving people

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.240
and products with an
enclosed metal frame

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.040
equipped with various
safety devices

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.320
using electrically-powered
control and locomotion

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.912
subsystems.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:59.800
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.760
That's pretty good.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.120
There's a lot there.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.750
I would throw a question.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.890
A concept you defined could
almost apply to a Tramway

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.660
as well.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.419
If this was like a
streetcar, don't you

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.960
think it would apply
to that as well?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.790
So I think the fact that
it's a personal vehicle,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.410
I think it's important.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.110
So the key in this is, describe
the concept using few words

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.930
precisely, but to set it apart
from neighboring concepts.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.070
What about Rolex Center?

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.580
It's a single-layer
building with multiple straw

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.820
used as a library for
people to meet and study.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.710
OLIVIER DE WECK: A single-story
building using multiple--

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.195
AUDIENCE: --floors.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:56.360
OLIVIER DE WECK: Floors.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.860
Oh, yeah.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.620
So that's right.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.710
AUDIENCE: You have one layer.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.020
However, it has this wave
shape and therefore, you

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.370
have something
akin to two floors.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.480
So the library is one
something like the upper floor

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.230
and the meeting areas, the
noisy areas on the lower floors.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.019
So you can connect
both, but the noise

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.324
doesn't connect that easily.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.240
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.340
No, that's very good, and I
think that's the architectural.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.940
And then the library is there.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.720
That's for sure?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.510
But isn't there a lot of
other things or services

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.400
provided in that building
beyond the library?

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:41.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have a bank,
a cafeteria, student services.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.180
But you could encompass
it in a meeting area.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.210
You meet and you do some stuff
like eating, going to the bank.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.120
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.144
AUDIENCE: I think we
missed some functions.

00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:55.060
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.540
So I like your
definition, but I think

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.130
by pointing out
the library, you're

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.980
missing the other functions.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.080
And my understanding is that
the reason this was built

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.730
was to put two things.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.130
One, is it's a focal point
for the community at EPFL.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.480
We have a student
center here at MIT.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.130
People go there to do their
banking, their eating,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.550
their meeting, and so forth.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.480
So in that sense,
it's pretty similar,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.720
but I think the Rolex Center
is such an iconic building

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.640
that it also serve a kind
of a prestige function,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.760
to put the institution
on the map in terms

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.040
of it's a statement.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.160
It's not just a
utilitarian building.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.790
Whereas, I would argue
our MIT student center,

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.250
it has very similar functions
to the Rolex Center,

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.630
but I wouldn't call
it an iconic building.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.870
It doesn't have that wow factor.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.000
Would you guys agree with that?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.810
Yeah.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.000
Maybe it did when it
was initially built.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.790
I'm not sure, but very good.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.530
So we could spend a lot of time
on these, but really crisply

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.960
refining and thinking about the
concept is very, very important

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.050
So let me very quickly go
through the refrigerator case

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.000
study to show how do we
transition from concept

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.830
to design.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.740
So the first thing you do is
understand where is the value--

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.250
the stakeholders
and the stakeholder

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.240
analysis and the
requirements definition.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.280
And so in order to do that,
you ask the question, first

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.470
of all, value identification.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.660
Where is the value?

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.120
And so you understand that
then who is the beneficiary?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.470
That's a stakeholder.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.200
The stakeholder has needs.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.820
I'm using OPM here
to describe this.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.640
And then this is a
funny thing here.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.560
The needs have
these little bumps.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.015
This is meant to
indicate a cloud.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.680
This is not standard
OPM nomenclature.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.010
Just point that out.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.930
So this means that the
needs are somewhat vaporous.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.120
They're not very well defined.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.440
And then you interpret and
incorporate some of the needs

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.110
into goals, which
become requirements.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.050
And so the goals then
are an instrument

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.710
of the primary delivery value
delivering process, which

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.510
is your value proposition.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.370
To then actually
deliver that value

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.670
you need to design the product,
the product system, the product

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.680
object, and understand the
operand, the thing that

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.080
is being operated
on or transformed

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.740
by the primary value
delivery process.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.360
That's a very abstract,
high-level way

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.350
to think about where's
the value in the system.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.910
But fundamentally, this is part
of the reducing ambiguity work

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.800
that you do as a
system architect,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.240
as a system engineer.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.400
And there is a recipe
for doing this.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.420
So first you start examining the
operand associated with value.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.400
What's really the
thing that generates

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.790
the value that the user, the
beneficiaries care about.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.130
Next you say, this is
the attribute link.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.550
What attributes of the
upper are changing or being

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.070
affected associated with value?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.160
And so the
attribute-transforming process

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.640
is where the value is generated.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.760
So for food, I think we briefly
talked about this before.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.180
Usually people will say, when
you think about a refrigerator,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.830
keep the food cold.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.309
But if you step back
and think about it

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.650
in a more abstract
way, it's really

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.010
about preserving
food or reducing

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.960
the spoilage rate of the food.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:48.350
So the refrigerator
effectively becomes a food

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.010
spoilage rate reduction device.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.380
and I know that sounds
terrible, but that

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.190
is really what it's about.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.110
So when once you
think that way, you

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.620
can really start being creative
and focus your creativity.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.440
So here we have the
food, and our goal

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.990
is to reduce its spoilage rate.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.110
And then you can ask,
well, how can we do this?

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.690
What are all the
different ways of reducing

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.990
the spoilage rate of the food?

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.750
So from among the system
operating processes,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:27.540
we then specialize and pick a
particular one for our concept.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.020
So beside chilling or
keeping the food cold,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.360
we could irradiate the food.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.260
We could we dry the food.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.890
What are some other ways that
we can reduce the spoilage rate?

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.010
So irradiating,
drying, chilling.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:43.510
Sam?

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.402
AUDIENCE: Preserving.

00:09:44.402 --> 00:09:45.568
OLIVIER DE WECK: Preserving.

00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:48.440
So you add chemicals
essentially.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.060
EPFL, how else can we do it?

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.290
Spoilage rate reduction?

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.574
AUDIENCE: Using chemicals?

00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:56.490
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.609
So that's chemical.

00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:00.150
That's right.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.110
What else?

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.600
Keep going.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.700
Because food is pretty
essential for humans,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.310
this is actually
one of the areas

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.260
where humans have
been very creative.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.020
There's a lot of
ways to do this.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.536
So keep going.

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:18.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for example,
for conserving grapes,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.730
maybe you do wine,
which is a process

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.590
to conserve this
wonderful [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.670
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:32.532
Please keep some wine
for us too, please.

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:34.720
AUDIENCE: Beer is the same.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.870
So marinating it,
vacuum packing, smoking,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.070
on and on and on.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.010
My favorite is
actually eating it.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.120
What do bears do?

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.020
How do bears conserve food?

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.185
AUDIENCE: Fat.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.060
OLIVIER DE WECK: Fat.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.559
Right?

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:57.630
So bears, they actually
consume it and then

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.160
transform it into fat, into
a different storage form,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.170
store it inside their
bodies, and then

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:10.710
as they hibernate,
that energy, that food

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.440
is being gradually consumed.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.570
That's a very different
way, but it's essentially

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.200
the same function.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.050
So that's the key idea is start
thinking in this abstract way,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.310
and all of a sudden all
these other possibilities

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.950
become possible.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.640
And that's really the cool part
about design and creativity.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.460
But eventually, you have to
pick a particular concept.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.195
So the chilling
part is not enough.

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:40.200
That's the function.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.120
And then you say, well,
we need a chiller.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.571
In order to chill,
we need a chiller,

00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:46.320
and there are different
types of chillers,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.450
like a cooler or refrigerator.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.020
And it's the combination
of this specific way you're

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.330
going to operate the system.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.390
The element of form and then
the specialized element of form,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.840
in this case the
cooler, that combination

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.480
is what we call concept.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.050
So once we have that, we can
start managing complexity,

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.070
decomposing function and form,
so our system operating process

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.820
gets decomposed into the
primary supporting processes

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.640
like interfacing,
powering, controlling.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.400
And then our system object,
you can decompose it

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.280
into different elements,
supporting systems,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.620
the operand, the
operator, and so forth.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.910
And then we can start
connecting them.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.900
So let's look at for
chilling the food,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.510
let's look at a cooler
and a refrigerator

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.550
in terms of this decomposition.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.040
So here's a picture of
a very simple cooler

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.020
that you would take
out on a picnic.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.510
It has the chilling
function, and then

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:47.160
the sub-functions when we
zoom in are holding the food,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.790
exchanging the heat between
the food and the environment,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.520
reducing the heat load,
interfacing, connecting,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.670
powering, regulating the
temperature, et cetera.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.010
And then on the form
side, the cooler

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.560
itself is very
simple structurally.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.590
It just has a bottom, a box
with a bottom and a top.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.250
And then we have the
ice, the food supporting

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.550
the surface, the external
heat load, ambient light,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.010
and the operator.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.560
What's surprising here
is when you map the two,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.530
there's a surprising
amount of complexity.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.110
It's not a very clear
one-to-one mapping.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.700
Let's just look at the ice.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.420
So here's the ice, and you can
just follow these links to see

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.800
what functions, sub-functions
does the ice support--

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.740
exchanging heat, powering,
and regulating temperature.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.040
So exchanging heat
means, essentially,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.290
the ice itself acts
as a heat exchanger.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.360
Just the surface
of the ice is where

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.700
the heat exchange happens.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.210
So what forms can you
put ice into a cooler?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.046
What are the different
shapes of ice

00:13:57.046 --> 00:13:58.420
that you could
put into a cooler?

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.470
AUDIENCE: Like an ice pack.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.150
OLIVIER DE WECK: You
could put ice pack

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.070
or you could put
a block or chips.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:16.090
And if you put the
same quantity of ice,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.190
but you put a block of
ice, you put little chips,

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.660
what will be the difference?

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.000
Will there be a difference?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.290
Surface area, right?

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.350
So the speed at
which the ice will

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.290
melt for the same given
external temperature

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.410
is going to be different.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:39.630
So there's an attribute of
the ice, which is essentially

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.290
its quantity, but also it's
form that will influence the--

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.780
but that's the heat
exchanger function.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.140
The powering function
is pretty clear.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:55.240
That's essentially the
energy storage right there.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.450
And then the third
one is regulation.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.140
How does that work?

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.057
How does the ice provide
a thermal regulation

00:15:02.057 --> 00:15:02.640
in the cooler?

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.650
Physics 101.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.602
Yeah?

00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:10.976
Go ahead.

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:11.852
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:11.852 --> 00:15:12.810
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.960
So as long as you have any
ice left in the cooler,

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.540
what will be the
temperature inside?

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.880
Not opening and
closing, but if you

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.530
keep it closed, what will be
the temperature in the cooler?

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.726
AUDIENCE: 0 Celsius.

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:25.850
OLIVIER DE WECK: 0 Celsius.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.620
As long as you
have ice left, this

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.400
is the phase transformation,
you're at that point.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.020
As soon as the ice
is all melting,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.400
the temperature will rise.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.230
So the phase transformation of
the ice from solid to liquid

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.330
is what, in fact,
is the regulation

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.010
mechanism inside the cooler.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.470
So even though you
think of a cooler

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.590
as being something super
simple and trivial,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.720
once you start listing
its internal functions

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.370
and how the top, the
bottom the ice itself,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.030
how they interact and
support those functions,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.340
it's pretty complex.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.140
And you can go
very detailed here,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.499
even for something very
simple like a cooler.

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.790
One question and then we'll
talk about the refrigerator

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.690
and how it's
different in a minute.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.380
One question I
often get is what's

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:19.000
the difference between system
architecting and system design?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.310
Isn't that the same thing?

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.400
And I think they're
somewhat different.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.100
They're overlapping, but
there's a distinction.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.630
So architecture selects the
concept, the decomposition,

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.970
mapping of function to form.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.490
And architecture
essentially establishes

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.040
the vector of design variables.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.950
What are the key design
variables and operating

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.110
parameters of the system?

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:48.690
Design, then, given that,
selects the actual values

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.350
for those design variables,
and then you can optimize.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:56.280
So if we look at the
example of the cooler here,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.840
we have our cooler with the box
in the bottom and then the ice,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.540
and we can decompose
the attributes of that.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.250
So the box with bottom
has length with height.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.380
It has a wall thickness.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.750
It has a type of material.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.180
The top has thickness
and material,

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.099
and the ice, like we
just talked about,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:19.020
has quantity, surface area, and
maybe initial water content.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.760
And those are the
operating parameters,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.119
and on the upper right, those
are the design variables.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.490
So when you are making
a material choice,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.040
we're going to use PVC.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.970
We're going to have a
2.1-inch thick wall.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.840
We're going to use
this much insulation.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.950
This will be the aspect
ratio of the cooler.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.010
It's going to have wheels
maybe, so we can pull it easily.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.560
Those are essentially
design decisions.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.760
You're instantiating
that concept.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.940
But the fact that it
has a bottom and a top

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.390
and it's hinged and
it uses this phase

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.690
transition as the
regulation mechanism,

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.920
that's conceptual design.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.840
That's system architecture,
and you need to do both.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.130
But they're not quite the same.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.370
Is that pretty clear?

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.000
That's a very
important distinction.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So let's look at
the form function

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.430
mapping for refrigerators.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.590
So this is actually
a big difference

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.390
between the US and Switzerland.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.870
People in the US, we like
to have big refrigerators,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.990
big gallon of milk, and
refrigerators in Switzerland

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.370
are much smaller.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.310
I'm not sure why.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.450
Maybe you go
shopping more often,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.880
but it's definitely one
of the big differences.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.170
But here we have essentially
the decomposition

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.400
of the refrigerator.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.840
So we have racks.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.710
We have the air.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.020
We have-- I guess
freon is banned now,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.660
so we should use some other.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.710
This is a refrigerant, a
working fluid, the insulation,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.340
the feet and rollers, the frame,
the electric motor, sensors,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.114
controller doors, lights.

00:18:55.114 --> 00:18:57.030
And then we have those
functions, essentially,

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.420
the same functions we had for
the cooler, holding the food,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.590
exchanging the heat,
powering, regulating.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.230
But the difference is
that we have much more

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.740
of a one-to-one mapping.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.220
So in the refrigerator,
each of these elements

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.180
supports, essentially, one
of the primary sub-functions.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.750
So the form function
mapping in the refrigerator

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.860
is actually much simpler.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.650
It's a much simpler
form function

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.480
mapping than the cooler.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.300
And you say, well, I thought
a refrigerator is much more

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.410
complex.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.770
How can that be?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.370
Well, the real complexity
comes in when you

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.220
look at the form form mapping.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.010
So this is then
the decomposition

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.365
of the refrigerator in terms
of all the elements of form

00:19:41.365 --> 00:19:42.990
and then how they
relate to each other.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.380
And I'm not showing here
all the sub-processes,

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.280
but you can see that the
mapping and the relationships

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.930
are much more complex than
in the case of the cooler.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:20:01.640
So to wrap up on this piece,
when we do a conceptual design

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.950
or system architecture, you
have two major activities.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.370
One is concept generation.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.850
So take the requirements
and think creatively

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.430
about how these requirements
could be fulfilled.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.950
So that means
understanding the operand,

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.730
the attribute of the operand
that you're trying to affect--

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.960
it could be multiple here--

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.660
the intent attribute--
this means the required,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.250
desired state--

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.590
what is the system
operating process,

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.020
and what is your
major element of form.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.110
So that's generating this
and specializing that.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.660
That's concept generation,
finding systems

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.520
that do the right thing.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.447
And then once you
have several concepts,

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.030
you've got to select
among them, which

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.440
we'll talk about next week.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.230
That's our topic next
week is concept selection.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.510
So finding systems
that do the right thing

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.890
and do it well, deliver value,
and comply with regulations,

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.220
standards, and so forth.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.000
So there's going to be
consumables involved,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.710
side effects, like noise,
waste heat, pollution.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.650
The operator, how skilled
does the operator has to be

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.820
or how autonomous is the system.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:10.130
What is the reliability,
safety, cost, the quantity.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.270
All those things are
describing the concept

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.640
and its instantiation
in more detail

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.580
and will help you do
concept selection.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.180
Do you do you see
the difference?

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.430
Concept generation is
take the requirements

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.110
and come up with the fundamental
form function mapping of how

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.100
the requirements can be met.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.870
Then you instantiate
that in terms of designs

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.050
and then you can evaluate
those and compare concepts

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.020
using other criteria
like consumables,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.060
quantity, how skilled does the
operator have to be, et cetera.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.920
So those are fundamentally
different activities.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.050
So let me summarize
on system architecture

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.850
and then talk about the NASA
approach and then creativity.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.250
So architecture
requires consideration

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.160
of both function and form
related through concept.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.770
It's about starting
with the operand.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.710
What is the thing that the
beneficiary, the stakeholder

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.670
cares about, and how
do we transform that?

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.640
Concept then elaborate
these into architectures

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.370
that have form function
and structural complexity.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.290
And then the goodness
of an architecture

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.900
is really a pretty
complex concept

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.750
where we have multiple
objectives to satisfy,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.860
including performance, resource
utilization, cost, operability,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.810
safety, capacity, and so forth.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.100
And we'll defer
that to next week.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.280
So let me briefly talk about
the NASA approach to this

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.500
and then talk about
some methods and tools

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.900
for concept generation.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.810
So the NASA approach
is basically

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.340
described in the
system engineering

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.520
handbook in the SE
engine as step 3

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.410
called logical decomposition.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:56.590
And so the logical
decomposition process,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.570
as described in
the NASA standard,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.550
is used to improve
the understanding

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.580
of the technical requirements
and the relationship

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.920
among those, transforming that
initial set of requirements

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.200
into a decomposition.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.410
So the idea that we need
to partition the system

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.500
and then derive lower-level
technical requirements based

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.860
on that lower-level
definition, and that's what's

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.010
called architecting.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.670
Getting back to our high-level
system design process,

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.620
this is, again, that
diagram that we've looked

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.200
at several times already.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.450
You can see the red box
is where this happened.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.020
So we started with mission
authority, stakeholder

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.930
expectation, and then defining
those high-level requirements.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.890
Level 0, level 1 requirements,
but then you get stuck.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.650
You get stuck because you
have to make some decisions

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.010
before you can go to lower
level requirements definition.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.590
And that's what's known here
as functional and logical

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.030
decomposition.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.130
Once you've decided
on a composition

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.130
and you can carry several
compositions with you

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.990
for a while, then you can do
the lower-level trade studies,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.410
derive and allocate
lower-level requirements refine

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.450
your CONOPS, and so forth.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.880
And then do functional
and performance analysis

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.090
to see whether you
have enough detail.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.020
Is it workable?

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.780
Is it safe?

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.120
Is it reliable?

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.020
And if yes, then you can select
that as a baseline, if not,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.140
you might have to go back
to the red box, which means

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.760
that architecture didn't work.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.710
We have to look for a
different decomposition

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.270
or different architecture.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.210
And if that doesn't work after
multiple iterations here,

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.174
you might have to go back
and change the requirements,

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.590
because you come
to the conclusion

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.590
that the requirements are
not really achievable.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.000
So some examples here
of decomposition models,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.030
here's a timing diagram.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.100
On the right side, you
have a state diagram,

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.560
the different states that
the system can be in.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.190
So you can see this relates very
strongly to the system modeling

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.810
languages that we talked about.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.940
So you use the system
modeling languages

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:06.360
to decompose and define
the system in more detail.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.680
And we really talked about
much of this already.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.820
And in terms of the logical
decomposition flow diagram,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.360
you start with your basic
high-level requirements

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.980
and measures of performance.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.040
You essentially do
your decomposition.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.430
And then on the right side, you
come out with the lower-level

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.330
derived technical requirements,
logical decomposition models,

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.070
which would be
essentially a description

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:37.350
of your different subsystems
and the logical decomposition

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.370
work products, which are
essentially lower-level

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.040
definitions of what these
subsystems look like.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.190
And then you can go off and do
the detailed design and then

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.930
the testing verification
and so forth.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.060
So it's essentially
focused on decomposition,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.700
which is an important
part of architecting,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.600
but it's not the
only thing you do.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.880
So let me talk about methods and
tools for concept generation.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.241
So I'm going to start with this.

00:26:06.241 --> 00:26:10.270
This is another really fun
thing we do in the system design

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.090
and management program,
which is a full-year program,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.030
is the we call it the
creativity workshop.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:21.010
So what are different ways
of stimulating or organizing

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:21.790
creativity.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.370
And what I'm showing
you here is--

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.500
that's essentially a
mind map of how to think

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.690
about the creativity space.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.630
So I'll briefly go through
this, and then we'll

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.170
look at a couple of examples.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:39.100
So one idea is that
creativity is better

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.310
if it's a group process, that
people stimulate each other.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.840
And so this whole group up
there is called group dynamics.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.400
These are all different methods
for stimulating creativity

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.640
using groups of people.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.010
And some of these are
authors that have written

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.840
and methods, so de Bono, Six
Hats, powwows, mind boggling,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.390
workouts, creativity
workouts, these

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.080
are all different variations
of group dynamic processes.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.240
The one that I'll talk
about in some more detail

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.980
is brainstorming.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.990
This is probably the best known.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.090
What's not so much known
about brainstorming

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.030
is that there's a
right way to do it.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.720
On the upper right
branch, creativity

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.590
and system architecture,
this is just

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.500
describing the importance of
it, the three themes we talked

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.440
about-- creativity,
ambiguity, complexity,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.850
different types of innovation,
radical innovation, modular,

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.760
or incremental innovation, and
so forth, and the high leverage

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.320
that it has.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.800
The next branch are called
models of creativity.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.660
What that essentially
means, and I'll

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.990
give you one example here,
which is Leonardo da Vinci,

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.110
is understanding
people that universally

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:57.880
are claimed as having been
very creative thinkers.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.960
Why were they creative?

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.980
What was their
recipe for success?

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.470
Below that, we have
structured processes,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.850
which are essentially trying to
organize the creativity, which

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.760
seems like an oxymoron,
but there are actually

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.520
ways to have a
structured process

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.620
to stimulate concept generation.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.590
And we'll talk about very
briefly mind mapping and then

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.720
morphological matrices.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.330
And then we have
this whole area here,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.240
which I'm going to
mention, but we're not

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.050
going to do as part of the
class, which is stimulants.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.050
So this is the idea
that somehow people

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.040
are more creative when
their brain, when you put

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.260
yourself into some other state.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.110
So bio-inspired design
would be you go in nature,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.930
or you read books about
seashells and animals and you

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.900
really try to
understand from nature--

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.750
and bio-inspired design
is a very important field

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.970
of research now.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:56.890
It's pretty serious.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:01.230
So you put yourself
in nature and be

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.200
inspired by what you see.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.300
Random inputs, provocations,
challenges, and then things

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.510
like alcohol, and even drugs.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.050
So a lot of the music that
was done in the hippie age

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.530
in the '60s, I mean,
a lot of these artists

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.900
were consuming large amounts
of drugs and alcohol.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.160
And there's a big discussion
on is this fundamentally

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.510
why they were creative.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.400
So I'm not advocating that.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.880
I'm just I'm just
telling you that there

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.090
is this idea that you
can stimulate creativity

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.080
in these different ways.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.500
So let's talk
about mind mapping.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.550
So this is an example of a
mind map that I really liked.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.220
This is from several years ago.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.330
This is from a student that took
the system architecture class.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:57.000
And so the idea of a mind map
is that you look inside yourself

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.250
and you try to put down on a map
different ideas and concepts.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.960
So in the core of it, you
have the key focal point

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.950
of the mind map.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.680
In this case, it's
system architecture,

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.020
and then you have these
branches coming off.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:22.050
So the class itself, the skills,
the concepts, the themes,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.930
and then it almost looks
like a neural network.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:29.040
You branch off into the
sub ideas and sub concept.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.680
And in order to really
make it memorable,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.750
you draw it by hand
even though there

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.100
is software for doing this.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:40.110
But I really like this, drawing
it by hand the old style.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.490
And then you add icons
and symbols and colors

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.700
to really make this
sticky and memorable.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.770
So you can look at that.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.660
I really like this example.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.500
And it probably takes
a couple of hours

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.390
to do a really good
mind map like this.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.340
But the idea is
that by doing this,

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.800
you're going to develop
your ideas and concepts.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.080
And there's books
about mind mapping.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.010
I mean, it's a whole
industry almost.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.570
Brainstorming.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.480
So by the way, who
has done brainstorming

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.630
and organized brainstorming?

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.550
Who's been part of a
brainstorming exercise?

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.980
Do you want to describe
it, how that worked?

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.422
Make sure you use the mic.

00:31:25.422 --> 00:31:30.150
AUDIENCE: So we started
with our problem,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:35.467
and if I remember it right, it
was to redesign a coffee mug.

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:37.050
OLIVIER DE WECK:
This was for a class?

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:44.910
And then basically, for the
first part, any idea could go.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.390
And the only role
was you couldn't

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.140
criticize anyone else's idea.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.290
So he basically tried to come
up with as much as we could,

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.859
wrote as much as we
could on the board,

00:31:57.859 --> 00:31:58.900
things along those lines.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:04.652
And then once we had
all of our ideas down

00:32:04.652 --> 00:32:07.110
and some people built off of
other ones and then it was oh,

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.170
but we can also add this.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.770
And then we started
to look at well,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.990
we can't really believe that.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.550
This is going to be
way too expensive

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.830
and started down
selecting from there.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.800
OLIVIER DE WECK: Did you take
a break between the two parts?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:23.605 --> 00:32:26.490
OLIVIER DE WECK: So yeah,
you described it very well.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.600
So the key idea is
there's some rules for how

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.540
to properly do brainstorming,
and some of them

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.400
are listed here.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.150
And then I have another
on the next chart,

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.130
there's sort of a step by step.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.910
So it's really try to
remove creativity barriers,

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.470
stimulate each other.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.830
There's an ideal group size,
and it says 5 to 10 here,

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.950
but I should probably
revise this to be--

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:50.810
what do you think?

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.050
7 plus minus 2.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.380
If you try to do brainstorming
session with 30 people

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.260
in the room, it's too big.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.720
It's not going to
be that productive.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.730
So use of intuition,
associations.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.140
What's important
is that you have

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.940
a clear idea of why you're
doing the brainstorming session.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.730
So there's some solution
neutral question,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.370
like how can we
improve a coffee mug.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.620
What did you come up with,
by the way, at the end?

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.187
Did you have a result?

00:33:18.187 --> 00:33:19.770
AUDIENCE: I think
it was we were going

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.410
to redesign the handle so
it would be more ergonomic.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.160
But, yeah.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.610
OLIVIER DE WECK: So what can be
done too, how can we improve.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.880
There's got to be a driving
question for the brainstorming

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.649
session.

00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:37.440
Actually, the first
time this was described

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.230
was by AF Osborn in
this book in 1957.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.840
There's why is
brainstorming useful.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.030
We can talk about that.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.460
A lot of it has to do
with this group dynamics.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.920
How to organize and host
a brainstorming session.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.510
I'll talk about that next.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.300
And then there's this killer
sentences you should never

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.560
say during a brainstorming.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.330
Some of these are pretty funny.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.910
And then what do you
do with the results.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.430
How do you actually then take
the brainstorming results

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.850
and use them for further
refining or down-selecting

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.350
concepts.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:15.810
So here's a six-step process for
doing a brainstorming session.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:21.280
So you send out invitations
a few days ahead of time.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.840
And the idea is that people
can think about this question

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.300
so that when they come to
the brainstorming session,

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.730
their brain is
preloaded with ideas.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:31.780
That's the idea.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:37.380
You don't just pull people
in like five minutes earlier.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.230
The idea is give a
few days, not weeks,

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.480
but a few days of
warning so that people

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.770
can think about this and come to
the brainstorming session ready

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.179
and charged to
share their ideas.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.489
7 plus or minus 2 participants.

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:56.020
There should be a facilitator.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.590
This is somebody who
is helping to moderate.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.720
Participants take turns
expressing thoughts,

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.000
suggestions, ideas.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.410
You should take notes.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.560
So for example, these big
whiteboards are great for that,

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.200
with idea paint, the whole wall.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.130
That's great.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.390
Or you can do flip charts.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.420
You can do different ways
of capturing these ideas.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.100
And then I think
you mentioned this.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.580
It's called the principle
of delayed judgment.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.730
So you're not
allowed to criticize

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.740
or particularly praise.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.400
So you could, for
example say, oh,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.170
this is the best idea we've
had so far in this session.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.140
Even though it's praise,
it actually implicitly is

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.610
criticism of the other ideas.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:38.720
So avoid that.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.490
Avoid the killer phrases.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:44.060
And then the idea there
is produce a large amount

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.730
and diversity of ideas.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:51.000
And then at some point, maybe
30 to 60 minutes, you end.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.750
Brainstorming session
that last four hours,

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.330
the first hour is
probably really good

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.760
and then the second hour
OK, and then the rest

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.850
is everybody is kind of
shot and, there's not

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.470
a lot of new ideas coming.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.540
Creativity killer sentences.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.680
I highlighted a few.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.870
This will never work.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.980
We don't even need
to talk about this.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.990
Everybody does it this way.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.710
I've already studied
this problem for years.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.680
Don't worry, I know I'm
right, and et cetera.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.700
How long have you been
with this company?

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.760
Anyway, so that's the idea.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.710
All right Leonardo.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.970
Who's been to Italy
or tour in France,

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.830
or who's seen one
of the exhibits

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.066
know where his notebooks
are on display?

00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:41.326
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:43.290
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.470
What about EPFL?

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.550
Have you guys seen
these wandering exhibits

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.710
about Leonardo's work
and his notebooks?

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.130
Anybody had a
chance to see that?

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.480
Go ahead.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.510
Actually, he do a lot of sketch,
and he [INAUDIBLE] the fact

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.344
that sketching is more
important than writing.

00:37:04.344 --> 00:37:05.260
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:05.960
That's right.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.900
So really, he didn't
build a lot of his ideas.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.470
So that's one of the--
did he actually then.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.330
But he was a head of
his time in many ways.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.870
So he's really been identified
as an exceptional individual.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.740
So here's a book called How
to Think Like Leonardo, Seven

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.330
Steps to Genius.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.920
And I'm not a big fan
of these popular books,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.040
but this one is
pretty interesting

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.025
because what's been
extracted from this

00:37:32.025 --> 00:37:37.020
is the seven da Vincian
principles of creativity.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.302
And they're here in Italian.

00:37:39.302 --> 00:37:41.260
I'm just going to go
through them very quickly.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.220
So curiosita, lifelong
quest for learning.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.150
Dimostratzione, testing your
knowledge through experience,

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.740
trying things out.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.680
Sensazione, continual
refinement of the senses.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.750
Sfumato, which is essentially
also a style of painting,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.860
like the Mona Lisa is
painted in sfumato style.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.080
Mastering ambiguity,
paradox, uncertainty.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:11.190
Arte/Scienza is the whole brain
thinking, left-right brain.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:16.650
Corporalita, balance of body
and mind, so a healthy mind

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.330
and a healthy body.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.280
And then connessione
is interesting.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.740
That gets close to system
architecture, which

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.060
is the appreciation of patterns,
relationships, connections,

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.470
and systems.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.100
So the idea is that,
this from Leonardo,

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.280
his work, his way of thinking,
these seven principles

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.240
have been extracted.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.730
And then you can say,
well, which of these

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:42.490
do I feel really
resonate with me?

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:42.990
All right.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.700
So we have only a
few minutes left.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.320
Let's move to some of
the structured processes

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.604
for creativity.

00:38:50.604 --> 00:38:52.020
So the first one
I want to mention

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.810
is this is probably the
simplest and the one that's

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.860
used the most.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.050
This is known as a
morphological matrix.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.130
So the idea there
is that you try

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:06.420
to define what are the key
features, factors, or decisions

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.250
that you have to
make when you define

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:10.380
a concept or an architecture.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.860
So the key decisions
are the rows.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.080
Let's say there's
n key decisions.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.880
There are factors in the rows.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.370
And then for each row
you think about what

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.500
are the number of possible
alternatives for doing this.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.020
And then you enumerate
all possible combinations.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.050
So an example here
would be here's

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.560
our morphological matrix.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:42.360
And then one possible concept
here would be A2, B1, C3.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.130
That's our concept here.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.330
And then you can see that for
a full-factorial enumeration,

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.670
you would have 27 architectures
that you could generate.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.460
So the number of
architectures here

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.590
is 27, based on this
morphological matrix.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.310
And I find this to be
very, very helpful.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.710
When the table gets
too big, very quickly

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.700
because of this being a product,
this can really explode on you.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.350
It can be very large.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:13.480
And the big challenge
with this, of course,

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.650
is if you have many factors, you
could generate many infeasible

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.400
architectures.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.190
Not all these combinations
are actually feasible.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.520
So the question then is,
how do you prevent that,

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.780
and that's where so-called
architecture enumeration comes

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.740
in.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.750
And I'm not going to go
in a lot of detail here.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.160
But the idea is that through
creativity, expert knowledge,

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.550
and analysis you're going to
define your components, which

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.910
are essentially the rows in
the morphological matrix.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.570
But you're also going to
establish rules that tell you

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.600
which combinations are
actually valid combinations

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.950
and which ones are not.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.290
And that, in fact,
is [? Narek's ?] PhD

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:56.310
topic is, how do you
increase the number

00:40:56.310 --> 00:41:01.150
of physics-based rules rather
than just empirical rules.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.400
Because if you think about it.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.410
If you apply rules that are
just based on current practice,

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.000
then you're just
going to recreate

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.280
concepts and architectures
we already have.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.100
You won't really come up with
something fundamentally new

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.260
because you've constrained
the combinations

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.570
to what people do now.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.900
So the real challenge here
is, between generating

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.240
all possible combinations,
many of which

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.760
are infeasible and only the
ones that we currently have,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.530
there's a middle ground there.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.020
So that's architecture
enumeration,

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.090
and there's different
ways of doing this

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.380
at different layers
of abstraction.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.780
So here's an example
of airplanes,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.640
different configurations
of airplanes.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.190
If you think about
the tail of airplanes,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:54.270
we have the traditional tail
with a lower stabilizer.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.350
We have T tails.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:59.100
We have we have V tails.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.350
I mean, there's like 12
different tail geometries here.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.800
And you could think of this for
the wings, for the fuselage,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.300
for the engine
locations, very quickly,

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.310
you can generate thousands or
even millions of architectures.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.120
But at that higher abstraction
layer, it's just a single tail.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.190
So how do you combine these
using compositional rules?

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.130
That's architecture enumeration.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.510
So here's also an example
from [? Narek's ?] work.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.350
So at an engine, a
turbo prop engine

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.390
at a high level of
abstraction, that's

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.810
basically a propeller,
an intake, a core,

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.250
and a core nozzle.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.310
And then to break that concept
in further detail, the core

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.490
itself gets shown at a
lower level of detail.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.170
And you can see that
inside the core,

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.470
you have, in this case, a single
compressor, a burner, and then

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.290
a turbine that drives
the compressor.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.590
And so one of the
advances in engines

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:03.420
has been from World War II to go
from single-stage to two-stage,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.230
thee-stage engines,
and so forth.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.350
So the complexity
has been going up,

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.710
but you can actually generate
through architectural

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.370
enumeration, essentially,
all architectures

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.500
that have been built
and that are known

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.430
and have been certified through
a organized architecture

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.590
enumeration process.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.330
Some of this can
be done in Excel,

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.640
for example, where
you essentially

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.790
list your components.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.670
This is your library
of components.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.470
And then on a
different sheet, you

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.750
define all the
different rules that

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.690
allow you to combine
different number of instances

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.030
of these components
into architectures.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.850
And we'll post some
information on this

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:47.220
if you want to try this
out for your concepts.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.170
So let me summarize.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:53.520
So system architecture is
definitely very abstract,

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.679
but it's also, potentially,
the most influential activity

00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:58.095
that we do in
system architecting.

00:43:58.095 --> 00:44:01.290
The concept is mapping
function to form.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.360
We typically, in the
conceptual design,

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.840
don't do all the details.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.490
We just go down two
levels of abstraction.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.930
So not all the
details are defined.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:14.130
The NASA approach
specify or is really

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.800
focused on this idea of
logical decomposition, which

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.370
is very important, but
it's not the only thing

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.170
we do in system architecture.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.840
And then the really cool
part, the exciting part

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.270
in concept generation is
the one that it's really

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.700
a creative activity.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:34.230
And when you look at the set
of creativity techniques,

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.080
you can think of group dynamics
like the brainstorming.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.140
That's used very
heavily, but you

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.820
have to do it the right way.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.740
If you organize a
brainstorming session,

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.790
and there's some wiggle
room, but if you violate

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.040
some fundamental principles
of brainstorming,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.680
you're not going to
get the full benefit.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.400
Models.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.820
So thinking about really
creative individuals

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.970
and what drove them, what
were their principles,

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.100
and try to emulate some of that.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.660
And then the
structured processes,

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.420
which include mind maps,
morphological matrices,

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.710
and then architecture
enumeration.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.700
So when you look at
assignment A3, which is now

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.700
out there, that's
really what it is about,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.630
is you've done the stakeholder
analysis and initial CONOPS,

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.980
you have a requirements set.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:26.050
So now be unchained, and
within the constraints

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.480
that are set by the
competition, come up

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.950
with different concepts.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:34.450
And in the homework, what
I ask you to do in A3

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:37.420
is try out at least two
different techniques,

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.670
a structured one and
an unstructured one

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.890
and then compare the results.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:44.940
And this will be
due in two weeks.

WILLIAM GREEN JR:
All right today, I

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.060
would like to do a Kinetic Monte
Carlo example with you in class

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.600
and, also, talk a little
bit about the connection

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.580
between the master equations,
master equation solution,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.354
the normal kinetic
equations we use, and the--

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.770
how you handle
these trajectories,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.950
you'll get how to
Kinetic Monte Carlo.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.740
All right, so let's just
pick a simple example.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.730
As we mentioned,
in the real world,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.630
it's pretty easy
for these examples

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.150
to get completely out of
hand, because the number

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.300
of possible states
can be so gigantic.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.540
Let's all do a really super,
super simple one here.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.970
To try to keep that underhand,
not worry about that.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.590
When you do the real problems,
that will be a major issue--

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.330
is if he number of
states get out of hand.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.640
So the simple
example I'm gonna do

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.704
is a real one from
inside your body.

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:26.245
So inside your body,
you have a thing

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:28.720
called low density lipoprotein.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.470
And there's little vesicles of
fat, lipids, inside your body,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.260
actually, in your blood vessels.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.390
And these are bad.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.100
If you go to the doctor, they
measure your LDL and your HDL.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.765
And if your LDL
number is too high

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:48.890
then they yell at you for
eating too much fat food.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.410
And they make you exercise
and stuff like that.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.484
This has happened
to me, so I know.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:56.650
And there's a reason for
this, is because the LDL is

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.990
susceptible to oxidation.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.710
And if too many of those
lipid molecules peroxidize,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.110
it causes inflammation
in your blood vessels.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.680
And that can cause
your blood vessels

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.300
to constrict and
stuff that eventually

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.254
can lead to heart attacks.

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:13.920
And so that's why
your doctor is alarmed

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.030
if you have too much
LDL, because you have

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.450
a lot more material available
that could be oxidized,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.357
that could kill you.

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:22.690
There's actually a really
complicated, interesting story

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.170
about what vitamin
E does in the LDL,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.144
and how it interacts
with vitamin C.

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:29.560
And if you take
my kinetics class,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.060
I'll tell you about that.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.700
But we'll do the
simplest case now.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.310
There's no vitamin E, there's
nobody Vitamin C. You just have

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.120
some lipid, and it's oxidizing.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.880
And let's model
what's happening.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.950
So what you have is a
little bubble of fat.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.510
So out here is water.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.190
And here's my fat which
I'll politely call lipid.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.690
That sounds like not quite
as fat, if you call it lipid,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.190
slimy.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.190
And the lipid is susceptible
to attack by this reaction.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.870
So if I have some
peroxy radical,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.460
and I have the lipid molecules,
which are some hydrocarbon,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.000
they can react and make
peroxide plus a radical.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.940
And in your blood
vessels, if you're not

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.600
under the water or being killed,
you have a lot of oxygen.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.580
And so the carbon
set of radicals

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.660
you form immediately
react with oxygen

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.410
to make the peroxy radical back.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.912
And so the net process--

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:36.370
we can kind of
combine these steps,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.821
because this is super fast.

00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:41.525
So it's like a
microsecond times scale.

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.650
For that to happen in your
body, because the oxygen

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.920
concentration is so
high in the blood.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:55.090
And so this reaction is
really roo, plus RAH, plus O2,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.930
to rooh, plus roo.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.700
So the radical is
just catalyzing

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.600
the oxidation of your
lipid into the peroxide.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.650
When this level gets too high,
then your body will detect it.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.414
There's an inflation, and you'll
have all kinds of trouble.

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:14.310
OK, so we like to
understand this.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.844
Now, these vesicles
are very small,

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:17.260
so there's a
probability you might

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.510
have only a very, very, small
number of radicals in there.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.218
Also, your body has
a lot of antioxidants

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:24.310
in it, like vitamin C and
vitamin E and some other ones

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.210
too.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.790
And the antioxidants are
trying to get rid of radicals.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.370
So the number of radicals you'd
expect the concentration--

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.430
background concentration
is very tiny.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.895
And because of
that, this is tiny

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:35.690
and the concentration is tiny.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.860
So the concentration times
the volume might also be tiny.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.100
So the total number of radicals
might be very, very small.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.852
And so therefore, you
might need to worry

00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:45.310
about the stochastic
kinetics being

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.110
different than the
continuum kinetics.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.140
OK, so that's the idea.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.510
Now, on top of that,
you also have a lot

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.220
of these vesicles in your body.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.525
So you might be able to somehow
work up some continuum model,

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:03.150
treat them all.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.860
And in fact, I think that's
what people did originally, is

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.318
they just said well, let's take
the total amount of LDL you

00:05:07.318 --> 00:05:09.241
got in your body and
do a continuum model.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.740
But as you will
see, it's different,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.619
because the fact that
the vesicles are small,

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:14.660
each one might only have,
say, one radical in it.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.826
And that will actually
behave quite differently than

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:18.470
if you had a lot of radicals.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.640
All right so, this
is the kinetics,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.230
and the oxygen is almost
always high concentration,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.200
so I'm not going to
worry about that.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.190
And I'm going to assume that
we're not going let your lipid

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.860
oxidize so much that the amount
of lipid changes significantly.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.640
So let's just, for now,
we can just ignore this.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.620
OK, maybe later we might
go back and figure out

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.744
how you'd account for the
fact that these cells are

00:05:42.744 --> 00:05:45.480
being consumed, which would
change the rates a little bit.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.780
So we'll just assume that
concentration is constant.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.760
So you have a tiny
amount of radicals.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.490
And if you had the
radicals in your vesicle,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.650
they're creating roh.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.550
And you see, the
ro is catalytic.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.600
And so what we're
gonna see is basically

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.040
D. If you did it in
classical kinetics,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.895
you'd write DR dt
this is basically

00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:10.912
equals some constant times roo.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.070
And then, I lumped
these concentrations

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.960
into this constant.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.700
[INAUDIBLE] That all right?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.400
All right, so that's
the import process.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.490
We also have another
important process,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.910
is that if you get
two radicals in there,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.470
and they bump into each other,
they can kill each other off.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.740
So two peroxy radicals
can combine and make

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.657
stable molecules.

00:06:39.657 --> 00:06:41.990
And we don't care what stable
molecules they really are.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.380
What's important is that
they get rid of the radicals,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.200
because the radicals
are catalyzing

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.930
the unfavorable oxidation.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.340
In this program I started
writing, I called this k3.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.692
This one is k4, reaction four.

00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:57.150
There's two other
things happening.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.145
Out here, I had some
peroxy radicals.

00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:01.080
They're floating
around the water.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.150
Some of them might
go into my lipid.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.060
I'll call that process K1.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.059
There's some time constant,
which new radicals arrive.

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:09.600
And then, I also
have the possibility

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.700
these guys could diffuse out.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.740
So I call that k2.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.050
And k1, I'll just
treat as a constant.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.560
So as soon as a background
concentration radicals

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.500
that's constant, and so this
is a sum-- every 10 seconds

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.550
or something, a radical
arrives in a vesicle.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.250
And this will depend
on the concentration,

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.810
the number of ro's.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.220
So the more you have
inside here, the faster

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.935
the rate which they go out.

00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:39.270
That all right?

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.807
And this just mass transfer.

00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:42.640
But from the point of
view of the equations,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.160
it doesn't care if it's mass
transfer or chemical reaction.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.010
They arrive in the same way.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.196
All right, so that's the system.

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:51.350
And so let's look at the--

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.680
I should try to write
the MATLAB code for this.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.240
And maybe, we can try to
finish this together in class.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.990
So I have four processes--

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.910
arrival of new
radical, diffusion

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.560
of the radical and
the vesicle, reaction

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.940
to make the peroxide,
and self-destruction

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.090
of the radicals.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.136
And I wrote down what
each of these does.

00:08:14.136 --> 00:08:16.510
So the first one increases
the number of radicals by one.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.010
The second one gets
rid of a radical

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.202
because it's diffused away.

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:23.160
The third one increases
the amount of peroxide.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.743
The last one gets
rid of two radicals.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.039
So we're going to try to compute
a trajectory by the Kinetic

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.580
Monte Carlo method.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.669
And trajectory is
going to be some time

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.230
points, the number of
radicals at that time

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.320
point, the number of peroxides
I have at that time point.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.130
And as I run, I'm going to
get many, many, different time

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.630
points.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.050
And each one will have a
different number of radicals

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.830
or a different
number of peroxides.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.350
And that's what I
want to compute.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.766
And then, at the end, after I
have trajectories like that,

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:56.690
big tables of these things, I
want to somehow put it together

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.420
to figure out on average
what happened or something,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.922
try to understand it.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.350
And so let's see, so my
inputs are the initial numbers

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:15.710
of radicals and peroxides in
the vesicle, the vector of rate

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.530
coefficients, the max
amount of time I want

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.290
to run the trajectory for--

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.970
not clock time, but
time in the simulation.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.260
So it's like how many
microseconds or milliseconds

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.520
or seconds I look
at my lipid protein

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.110
and see what it's doing.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.080
And the maximum number
of steps, because I

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.000
don't want to get a
trajectory list that's

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.970
10 to the ninth long, because
over a while, my memory,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.270
my computer would
cause me trouble.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.727
So here they are,
all the setups.

00:09:43.727 --> 00:09:44.810
Everything is fine so far.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.911
So here's the loop.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.850
So the outermost loop is just
to keep track of how many steps

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.080
we have, which is going to
be the number of entries we

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.350
have in the trajectory table.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.440
And the second one is really--

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.120
what we care about--
is well, the time

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.121
is less than the maximum
time of the simulation.

00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:14.161
First, we want to figure
out the time [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.640
until something happens.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.620
So following Joe
Scott's notes, we

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.290
compute this quantity
called A, which

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.560
is the sum of all the rates.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.860
And that's equal to the
rate of the first process.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.110
And then, they're in the
second process, which depends

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.666
on the number of radicals.

00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:32.040
And the rate of
the third process

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.700
all depends on the radicals.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.200
And the rate of
the fourth process,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.491
which is a number radicals
times the number of radicals

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:38.520
minus one.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.210
Now k4 has to have
units of per second.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.730
But bi-molecular rates would
normally have units of volume

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.650
per second, per mole even--

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.580
volume is per
molecule per second.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.300
And so that k4 has to
really be a normal kind

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.160
of k divided by the volume.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.910
And we're going to
have to figure out what

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.810
to do about that in a minute.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.460
And then, we do the
formula to get the--

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.310
Gillespie's formula
for how to sample

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.120
from an exponential
decay, as good as that is.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.160
So Gillespie thinks that the
probability that something

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.780
is going to happen, or
the probability, the time,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.760
until the next thing
happens is going as e

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.560
to the negative a times t.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.000
So we're trying to sample
from e to the negative, a, t.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.140
And that's what that crazy log
of the random number is doing--

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.270
it's sampling from
that distribution.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.270
And so we get a [INAUDIBLE]
that how long we've

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.700
waited from the time
the last thing happened

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.950
until the next thing happened.

00:11:54.602 --> 00:11:56.310
And now, we have to
figure what happened.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.860
So there's four
different processes

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.995
that could have happened.

00:11:58.995 --> 00:12:00.700
A radical could have arrived.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.229
A radical could have left.

00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:04.520
A radical could have reacted
with one of my hydrocarbon

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.990
molecules, with
one of my lipids,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.860
or the two radicals could
have killed each other.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.550
So we list these guys out.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.580
A is the sum of all
those processes.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.836
P1 is the probability that
the first process happened,

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:19.960
that a new radical arrives.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.920
So it's going to be the k for
the first step, divided by a.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.230
That one was zero
water, because it's

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.070
subterfuging it from outside.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.530
So it's just a k of 1.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.791
Probably the second
step is k2 times n rad.

00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:39.290
That's the rate of the second
step divided by the total rate

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.645
of all the processes.

00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:42.020
And I'm going to
add that onto p1

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.160
to make a vector of possible
things that could happen.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.890
So I'm picking a random
number from zero to one.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.007
And I want to make a little bar.

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:56.090
Here's the probability the
first process happened.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.590
And here's the probability that
the second process happened.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.200
And here's the probability
the third process happened.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.450
And here's the probability
the fourth process happened.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.529
I know that these guys
have to add up to one,

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:06.320
because I computed that
something happened.

00:13:09.142 --> 00:13:11.950
And so I'm going to try to
compare my random number

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.250
from zero to one to these breaks
and sort it out into these four

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.290
possibilities, and then figure
out which thing happened.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.960
OK, so this is the second
step of Gillespie's algorithm.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.250
All right, so maybe you guys can
help me finish the code here.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.806
If you want to go to Broadway
in Chicago, you can go there.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.230
So I need to write the next one.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.820
So p3 is equal p2 plus what?

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.834
So step three is--

00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:53.214
sorry?

00:13:53.214 --> 00:13:54.166
Say again.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.390
WILLIAM GREEN JR: All
right, that's enough, right?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.910
So now, I get to
choose a random number,

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.490
so, say, x is equal to rand.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:29.210
And then, I have to say if x is
less than p1, than something.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.220
What's it gonna be?

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.630
Then step number one happened.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:39.660
So that means that n rad
is equal to n rad plus one,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.580
so one radical transported in.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.305
If x is less than p2--

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.265
[INAUDIBLE] Is that good?

00:14:57.265 --> 00:14:59.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.560
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
[INAUDIBLE] space.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.060
Thank you.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.670
What happens here?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.690
So this is b, n rad is
equal to n rad minus one?

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:14.430
WILLIAM GREEN JR: I think they
also take care of that, right?

00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:18.215
Is this right?

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:28.500
X is less than p3, than nroh.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.970
Else and rand.

00:15:45.227 --> 00:15:46.650
Does that look right?

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.898
Do I need an end?

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:50.832
AUDIENCE: Semi-colon.

00:15:50.832 --> 00:15:52.040
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Semi-colon.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.170
Semi-colon, thank you.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.690
That would be really bad.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.830
All right, yes, Ziggy?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.306
AUDIENCE: So in
the first problem,

00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:04.429
you have step size longer
than that [INAUDIBLE] size.

00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:05.970
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
So that's not good.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.270
It should be less than.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:07.770
Thank you.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.035
Any more bugs?

00:16:15.035 --> 00:16:17.874
AUDIENCE: I think you need
spaces after the brackets.

00:16:18.374 --> 00:16:21.899
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Spaces
after the brackets-- where?

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:22.440
Is that here?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.187
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:24.187 --> 00:16:26.020
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
[INAUDIBLE] separate line.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:29.917 --> 00:16:31.250
WILLIAM GREEN JR: I can do that.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.080
It's easier to read anyway.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.840
So that's good.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.165
I definitely agree with that.

00:16:34.165 --> 00:16:35.497
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:35.497 --> 00:16:36.830
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Is that right?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.310
WILLIAM GREEN JR: You like this?

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.685
With all these [INAUDIBLE]
sets, I don't need any n's, is

00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:45.310
that right?

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.690
[INAUDIBLE] after the other
like that, no problem.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.690
Just one end at the end.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:50.005 --> 00:16:51.255
WILLIAM GREEN JR: That's good.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:57.350
All right, so
we're OK with this?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.641
We think this is going to work?

00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:00.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.741
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:07.240
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
All right, so now,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.020
we've computed what's
going to happen.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.280
Now, we need to store
results somehow.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.589
So I'm gonna say
trajectory is equal to--

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.324
or trajectory of steps--

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.784
so step was zeros.

00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:28.329
Now, step is one.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.119
[INAUDIBLE] step is
one, to start with.

00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:31.616
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.233
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
Does this look good?

00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:55.220
They had only commas,
is that right?

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.332
No commas?

00:17:56.332 --> 00:17:58.737
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:06.150
WILLIAM GREEN JR: All
right, one step is zero.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.663
I already have the first
line filled in here.

00:18:08.663 --> 00:18:10.595
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.400
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Is that good?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.060
We'll see.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.131
I don't know if it's OK or
not, but I'll believe you.

00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:23.880
All right, so right
now, we have a program

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.420
that maybe or maybe not might
actually compute something.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.350
Is that right?

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.280
OK, now, we to figure out--

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.840
are we going to
run this program?

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.952
So we need an initial.

00:18:33.952 --> 00:18:35.528
So any suggestions?

00:18:35.528 --> 00:18:37.520
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:43.632 --> 00:18:45.840
WILLIAM GREEN JR: All right,
so let's do an initial--

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.262
how about n rad is equal to
1 and nroh is equal to 0.

00:18:51.262 --> 00:18:52.880
Is that OK?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.250
We're cool with that?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.960
And how about k?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.840
So we need a vector of k's.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.345
Yup?

00:19:04.345 --> 00:19:06.481
AUDIENCE: For your
line 18, I think

00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:09.095
that's just the [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.374
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
Yes, thank you.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.070
Yes?

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.430
All right, so let's think about
what's reasonable for the k's.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.180
So I think we can make the
k for this stuff diffusing

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.862
in very, very small.

00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:36.570
So I don't know--

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.350
[INAUDIBLE] make a small,
1e minus 5 something.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.050
Isn't that small--
only once an hour.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.660
You think it might be
a little too small?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.920
And then, the next one is how
fast do things diffuse out?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.820
Now, what's that going
to physically depend on?

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.936
It should be something
like the diffusion.

00:20:00.936 --> 00:20:03.480
Diffusion [INAUDIBLE]
get back to the wall,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.310
back to the outside.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.090
So it should be--

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.307
by one radical in here,
what's the average time for it

00:20:12.307 --> 00:20:13.140
to diffuse back out?

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.420
Any ideas?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.030
So if it does, say, just
a random walk, maybe--

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.910
then you say that delta x
squared is like d times tt.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.700
OK, so delta x
squared, maybe make

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.260
this like the radius
of our lipid vesicle,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:47.050
so that delta t is
like r squared over d.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.200
Seems like a reasonable scaling.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:56.690
And we actually want to rate,
so we want the other way around.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.490
So k2 is going to be something
like d over r squared.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.301
All right, so we need to pick
a size of our LDL vesicles.

00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:08.800
I don't actually
know what they are.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.500
I used to know this,
but I don't remember.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.874
Anybody want to
make a guess, how

00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:14.390
big is a vesicle inside
your blood vessel?

00:21:18.262 --> 00:21:19.714
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.520
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Micron, OK.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.710
So let's pick a mircron.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:29.530
So let's say r is equal to
10 to the minus 6 meters.

meter squared per second.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.756
OK, so feasible.

00:21:41.756 --> 00:21:43.628
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:45.880
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Anybody
know if it's meter squared

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.230
or centimeter squared?

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.085
What?

00:21:49.085 --> 00:21:50.225
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:50.725 --> 00:21:51.500
WILLIAM GREEN JR: You guys
did the one of the drug.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.220
What was the drugs one?

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.803
Was it 10 to the minus 6, meter
squared or centimeter squared?

00:21:54.803 --> 00:21:55.886
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.790
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
Meters squared.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.260
OK, so for a light, smaller
molecule, it's reasonable.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.110
So this number should
be something like 10

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.045
to the minus 5, divided
by 10 to the minus 12,

00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:12.555
so something like 10 to the 7.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.950
1, 8, and 7.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:34.805
All right, now for the
reaction, roo plus RH,

00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:36.920
we can go look it up
on the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.750
They'll have a list of
reactions like that.

00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:44.140
For now, let's just guess.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.570
And so let's say that k3--

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.210
k of roo plus rh--

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.240
these guys typically
have 8 factors of 10

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.080
to the eighth leaders
per mole second.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.600
And they have ea's, about 15--

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.565
15 k cals per mole over rt.

00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:13.990
OK so now, we need to
figure out how to turn this

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.210
into the k3 we want.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.410
Now, the k3 we want is really--

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.560
K3 is like this--

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.370
times the concentration
of the rh,

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.750
because we took the
rh out of the problem,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.490
because we want this to
have units of per second.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.810
Is that right?

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:51.260
And this is in units
of volume per meters

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.410
cubed per mole second.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.750
And this would be
moles per meter cubed.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.180
And so it's per second,
which looks right.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.014
OK so now, we need to have--

00:24:05.014 --> 00:24:06.430
I understand we
have a calculator?

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.830
We can try to calculate this
number for room temperature.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.470
And this does not mean room
temperature is r time t--

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.310
actually for body temperature.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:21.754
And the concentration
of hydrocarbon--

00:24:21.754 --> 00:24:23.920
it's actually the number
of h's, because every h can

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.050
be attacked in a hydrocarbon.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:33.970
So you typically have
densities of 0.8 grams

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.890
per centimeter cubed.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.770
It's for organic.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:50.680
And you typically
have two h atoms

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.950
per 14 grams of ch2
groups, because you only

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.600
see h2 groups in there.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:04.480
S two h atoms.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.670
And then, if we're going
to try to keep moles here,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:18.434
we need 6 times 10 to
the 23rd atoms per mole.

00:25:22.092 --> 00:25:23.800
All right, and this
is centimeters cubed,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.486
but this one has
leaders, so I need 10

00:25:27.486 --> 00:25:31.099
to the 3 centimeters
cubed [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:33.640
So again, verifying what your
high school teacher taught you,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.370
that the first thing
is to learn units.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.690
So we take all these numbers.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:50.077
This is the RH,
and this is the k.

00:25:50.077 --> 00:25:51.660
And we can multiply
them all together,

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.690
and we should get something
reasonable, maybe.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.230
And since we have MATLAB we
can make it do it for us.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.020
So let's just do that.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.360
So I think it's--

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.580
you have to help me, I
can't read this very well.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:15.260
1ea star exponential,
[INAUDIBLE] 15,000,

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:26.950
slash 1.987 times--
what's body temperature?

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.520
40ec you told me?

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.774
So it's 310 Kelvin maybe--

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:40.550
times all these
numbers, 0.8 times 2.

00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:56.410
Divide by 10 to the 23rd.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.090
More factors in there.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:19.035
OK, so 5 times 10
to the minus 25.

00:27:19.035 --> 00:27:20.160
We think we got this right?

00:27:34.573 --> 00:27:37.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.810
WILLIAM GREEN JR: But
I want to get moles,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.810
because I have this in moles--

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.230
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.461
Three times mole
[INAUDIBLE] This

00:27:58.461 --> 00:27:59.960
is really mole of
[INAUDIBLE] atoms.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.650
OK, so we'll try and
see what happens.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.860
So 5 times 7 minus 25.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.640
It does seem pretty small,
so we have a problem.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.210
And then the last reaction--

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.891
those reactions are typically
10 to the fifth, liters per mole

00:28:24.891 --> 00:28:25.390
second.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.150
This is for a recombination
of peroxy radicals.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:40.300
So now, we have to get
rid of the volume unit.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.380
This is for roo--

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:52.740
sorry, [INAUDIBLE] Yeah?

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.360
Yes, question?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.927 --> 00:29:12.760
WILLIAM GREEN JR: One
mole per [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.735
Very good-- that's right,
because [INAUDIBLE] that's

00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:16.360
just two atoms.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.470
It's actually two moles.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.105
Yes?

00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:23.480
That would change
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.590
Only a factor of 10 to the 23rd.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.040
So we'll get back.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.770
Thank you.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:41.449
Area 0.3, somewhere like it.

00:29:41.449 --> 00:29:42.990
OK, so now let's go
do the same thing

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.230
with this one, ro plus roo.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:51.800
So typically these reactions,
the normal way they're written

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.090
are numbers that are about 10
to 5th meters per mole second,

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.066
for two radicals recombining.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:07.115
So now, I need to figure out how
can I change the volume here.

00:30:07.115 --> 00:30:09.240
And the thing that is key
is that I know the volume

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.340
of this lipid particle.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.550
So what I really want is this.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:22.080
My k4 is going to be
equal to normal k, divided

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:28.530
by the volume of the
reactor, because the rate we

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.570
would write normally,
which would be droodt--

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.510
it would be like
negative 2k roo plus roo,

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:49.280
times the moles, the
concentration of roo squared.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.797
This how we would
normally write it.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.282
And so we have to have the--

00:30:56.282 --> 00:30:57.240
this unit is all right.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.710
So this is the volume
of the reactor.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.820
So we were having
nroo over v, so we

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:11.180
might need Avogadro's number
over here, because the rate

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.250
here is in moles.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.635
But now, we are going
to do single molecules.

00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:16.135
Yeah?

00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:21.470
AUDIENCE: Do you ever actually
use k4 in calculations?

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.000
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Yeah, for a.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.680
I think an a is there.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.060
Good question.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.450
All right, so we
think this should

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.931
be like a volume per
molecule or something

00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:36.680
like that, for one molecule.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.870
So this should be
k4, should be 10

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:47.750
to the 5th, meters
per mole second,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.780
divided by 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.730
And then, we need a mole--

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.255
[INAUDIBLE] 23rd molecules.

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.630
And we're gonna
have to make sure

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.338
that the leaders and
these guys match up,

00:32:07.338 --> 00:32:10.815
which is not going
to be so easy.

00:32:10.815 --> 00:32:14.160
You might use 10 to
the minus 6 meters.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.590
This is going to
be meters cubed,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:21.936
so I need 10 to the 3
liters per liter cubed.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.780
And I think that will all
work out to be per second.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.620
So let's try it.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:39.540
So this would be 10 to the
5th over 4/3 pi is about 4--

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.560
10 to the negative 18,
6 times 10 to the 23rd.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:55.090
So all the big ones cancel
each other out, is a 1 over 24.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.940
Oh, I lost it.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.570
That's bad.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:12.167
OK, so one over 24,000.

00:33:12.167 --> 00:33:14.000
It's a lot easier to
do with a lot of people

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.682
checking your work.

00:33:15.682 --> 00:33:17.140
All right, so four
times n minus 5.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.450
So this is what we think k is.

00:33:29.794 --> 00:33:30.710
Anything else we need.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.870
We need a t-max, you
want to guess the time?

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.840
You want to wait?

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.230
The time for the main
reaction, the time constant

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.150
is like seconds, right?

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:48.460
So if we made 1,000
seconds, a lot of stuff

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.830
is going to happen, right?

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:55.260
So maybe 1,000 seconds
will be OK for t-max.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.562
So let's try this all.

00:33:59.945 --> 00:34:01.547
Where's the main function.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.219
The main function--

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:22.489
[INAUDIBLE] my n
initial was simple 1, 0.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:52.230
And k, which was decided was 1e
minus 5, [INAUDIBLE],, 2.3, 4e,

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.489
25.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.067
Now, if you just look at
these rates for a second,

00:34:58.067 --> 00:35:00.150
I think you can see a
problem we're going to have.

00:35:05.077 --> 00:35:06.493
How many steps are
we going to do?

00:35:06.493 --> 00:35:09.331
I don't know.

00:35:09.331 --> 00:35:13.900
10,000.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.970
The time scales here--

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.580
this 27 is pretty fast.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.622
So the stuff is going
to diffuse out of there,

00:35:20.622 --> 00:35:22.663
because it's going to
disappear, and then nothing

00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:23.210
is gonna happen.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.709
Yeah?

00:35:23.709 --> 00:35:26.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.870
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Centimeters
squared, I thought so, yeah.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.880
Thank you, so we think
this is 10 to the minus 9.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:42.800
So this is actually [INAUDIBLE]
lower, is that right?

00:35:44.955 --> 00:35:46.330
We're still gonna
have a problem.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.480
But it's not quite bad
[INAUDIBLE] problem.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.230
So let's fix that.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.470
Um, so I think our problem
is that the 1e minus 5

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.270
is actually too slow.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:04.580
So radicals are diffusing in
from outside at some rate,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.120
and it's got to be a
rate so that if there

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.180
was no reaction, basically,
the concentrations of the stuff

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.045
here and here might be about the
same, same order of magnitude,

00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:15.170
of the stuff that dissolved
in the water, dissolved

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.637
in the lipid.

00:36:16.637 --> 00:36:18.470
Maybe a couple of
[INAUDIBLE] are different,

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.630
but not a million
times different.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:27.860
And so we need to have the
rate of this stuff coming in

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.720
to be something
reasonable, that's

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.180
going to be consistent with
having a chance of having

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.770
some radical in there.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.200
So now we to guess what we
think the real outside world

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.360
radical concentration is.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.000
So maybe-- I don't know, what?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.400
1e minus 10 moles per liter?

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.100
1e minus 6 moles per liter?

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.297
I don't know.

00:36:47.297 --> 00:36:48.130
Any biologists here?

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.505
Do you know how many free
radicals you have in your body?

00:36:50.505 --> 00:36:52.634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:53.015 --> 00:36:54.890
WILLIAM GREEN JR: They
can measure it, right?

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.052
So it can't be zero.

00:36:57.052 --> 00:36:58.760
People talk about
reactive oxygen species

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.622
in your body, ROS.

00:37:01.622 --> 00:37:04.080
Yes, so I don't know what it
is, 10 to the minus 6, maybe--

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.270
10 to the minus 8.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.740
So we had the number for--

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.770
1e3 e3 is for going
out from the--

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:32.710
we have that rate leaving is
1e3 per second times the number

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.600
in there divided by
the volume, really.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.330
Well, it's times the number,
that's the rate that's leaving.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:45.665
But we would think
of this as a k.

00:37:47.387 --> 00:37:49.220
I don't know how to
think of this, actually.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.240
But for sure, the
volume matters.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:58.990
So in order for us to compute
this, we use the r squared.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.530
Now, another way you
look at this is say well,

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.228
is diffusion times the
gradient in the concentration?

00:38:05.228 --> 00:38:07.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:14.510
WILLIAM GREEN JR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.420
Well, it's OK.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.270
They would live in their little
tiny thing for a millisecond,

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.940
and then they diffuse out.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.815
I think that actually
sounds very reasonable.

00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:21.080
It's only a micron.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.642
It's a very tiny, little thing.

00:38:22.642 --> 00:38:24.725
So the question is how do
we complete the reverse?

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:33.970
So if we have stuff outside, and
suppose we didn't have anything

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.656
inside, we'd have some rate
of diffusion of the radical

00:38:36.656 --> 00:38:37.780
from the outside coming in.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.910
How do we think about it?

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.660
It's really got to be
the inverse of this.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.110
So if we think the
time constant is

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:54.220
10 to the minus 3-- a
millisecond to come out,

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.790
it's probably about a
millisecond to come in.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.200
I don't know.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.430
You think it's got to maintain
whatever initial concentration

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.420
we put there, one
per volume, then

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.750
it's got to be about the same.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.870
So this can't be as tiny
as 10 to the minus 5.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.380
So if we take the average
concentration as one,

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.080
then this should 10
to the 3, I think.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.230
If we think the average
concentration is 10,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.560
then it should be 10 to the 4.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.960
If we think the average
concentration this 100,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.480
then it should be
10 to the five.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.990
So let's try 10 to the 3.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.780
So every millisecond,
something comes in or goes out,

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.690
some radical comes in and out.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.900
You guys buy this?

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.505
Would you defend
this to your boss?

00:39:47.505 --> 00:39:49.980
You can blame it
on Professor Green.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.470
All right, here goes nothing.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.626
Do you think it's going to work?

00:39:53.626 --> 00:39:55.578

00:39:56.554 --> 00:40:01.319
Aww, aww, line 29.

00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:01.860
What's wrong?

00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:09.000
What's wrong with that?

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:12.906
Parentheses off?

00:40:12.906 --> 00:40:17.485
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:17.485 --> 00:40:19.860
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Maybe I
didn't save the latest version,

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.094
let's try again.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.640
Ah, I didn't say
the latest version.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.746
That's what it is.

00:40:31.052 --> 00:40:32.010
Now, here goes nothing.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.940
That [INAUDIBLE] help.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.100
Leave me alone.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:47.800
All right, trajectory,
the first column

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.260
is the times, so
it uses the x-axis.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:57.170
And the last column is the
oxidation, the products.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.003
So let's see if anything
peroxidized or not.

00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:10.754
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:13.249 --> 00:41:15.245
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:32.963 --> 00:41:35.529
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Oh, it should
have all the zeros, right?

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:37.570
So how can we do it when
we [INAUDIBLE] that way.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.280
That's really weird.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.250
Try it again.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.410
WILLIAM GREEN JR: The
time is 2 plus tau.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.720
WILLIAM GREEN JR: I guess if
you look at the [INAUDIBLE] So

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.440
trajectory--

00:42:11.187 --> 00:42:12.520
so it only [INAUDIBLE] 2 points.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.390
That's why it looks like that.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:15.181
I don't know why it
doesn't show the zeros.

00:42:15.181 --> 00:42:17.160
Maybe they'll show on
top of the origin there.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.116
So why did it only
give us two points?

00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:22.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.550
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Yeah, also--

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:32.430
seems like a 307 oxidations,
but why 307 all of a sudden?

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.820
That makes no sense, right--

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.840
because it should
be one at a time.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.525
I should be seeing one
at a time coming in.

00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:42.473
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.570
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Yes,
it's very worrying.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.880
I agree, so we have a bug.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.710
So where is our bug.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.010
This is where I need your help.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.460
OK guys, let's figure
out why didn't this work.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.940
So I'm storing-- by stepping
the steps, they're going up.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.590
Ah, I know what's wrong.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.890
I need this step thing
inside the loop here.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.620
So all of this--

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.700
so let's see if I
can explain this.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.220
I'm storing them
according to the step,

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.150
but right now, the wild
loop is just zipping around,

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.450
and then, it ends at the
step and just gets one.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.560
So I'd rather start again.

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:37.226
It's gonna work this time?

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:40.875
You guys don't have any faith.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.150
If people say that scientists
and engineers don't

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.030
have any faith, I think we have
more faith than anybody else.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.863
We believe stuff like
this is going to work.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.150
It's doing something now.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.620
Who knows what?

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.036

00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:36.330
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Yeah,
it's a very good point.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.308
I have a nested loop that
should not be, right?

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:41.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You don't necessarily

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.354
want to sample
every arrival time.

00:44:43.354 --> 00:44:46.216
You might want to
sample [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.124
So you might want to have two.

00:44:48.124 --> 00:44:50.520
You don't necessarily want
to [INAUDIBLE] every single--

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.925

Yes, yes, I agree.

00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:57.360
WILLIAM GREEN JR: OK, so
let's see how we can fix this.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.910
So we really want-- is
it really a jump out?

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:03.574
If the number of
steps gets too large,

00:45:03.574 --> 00:45:05.490
we just want to jump
out, so we want to go to?

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.624
What do you think?

00:45:06.624 --> 00:45:07.475
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:07.475 --> 00:45:09.350
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Break,
that's what we want.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.284
So while is not the
correct thing to do here.

00:45:11.284 --> 00:45:14.070

t [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.150
WILLIAM GREEN JR: So
we're stepping time,

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.709
every time we'll do the steps.

00:45:17.709 --> 00:45:18.750
And we just want a break.

00:45:21.642 --> 00:45:27.096
[INAUDIBLE] step
greater than max steps.

with a while loop [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:33.729 --> 00:45:35.270
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
What happens if you

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.980
do a wild loop like that?

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.560
Do you guys know?

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.101
Does it work?

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:37.935
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.142
WILLIAM GREEN JR: It'll work.

00:45:39.142 --> 00:45:40.176
OK, that's easy.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.679
Double and-- I tired it
with and this morning.

00:45:52.679 --> 00:45:54.720
It didn't work, so that's
why I stopped doing it.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.760
Stuff like that will
kill you, doesn't it?

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.384
All right, we gotta get rid
of one of the ends at the end.

00:46:05.384 --> 00:46:07.352
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:10.075 --> 00:46:12.450
WILLIAM GREEN JR: I think it's
likely to cause a problem,

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.279
why it's taking
10 million years.

00:46:14.279 --> 00:46:16.820
So really, is there a reason it
should be nested loop, right?

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.477
Yes.

00:46:17.477 --> 00:46:19.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.839
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
All right, try again.

00:46:32.839 --> 00:46:34.691
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:36.095 --> 00:46:38.370
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
That's too fast.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:41.170
Try that again.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:41.850
That's not good.

00:46:44.916 --> 00:46:47.608
See we have a [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:46:47.608 --> 00:46:48.390
AUDIENCE: Oh no.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:53.280
WILLIAM GREEN JR:
Oh, jumps to one.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.400
That doesn't look very good.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.171
Try that again.

00:46:58.171 --> 00:46:58.670
Boom.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.000
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.208
WILLIAM GREEN JR: Oh, that
was pretty interesting, so

00:47:09.208 --> 00:47:12.400
much more like what you expect,
so that at some time steps,

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.700
I have one, two, three,
or four, or five radicals

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.010
in this vesicle.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:21.350
I only have one time
separate because of the nine.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.800
So I think this actually
looks like what I expect.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.670
I should see it jumping up and
down, stuff goes in and out,

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:28.852
sometimes it reacts,
sometimes it goes away.

00:47:28.852 --> 00:47:29.810
So this one is correct.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.860
I don't know what's
happened with the other one.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.930
So I'll have to
figure out what's

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:33.971
wrong with that equation.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.695
All right, we're
almost done time.

00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:41.820
Well, I want to talk about
for just one minute is--

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.820
what are we gonna do after
we have this working?

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.420
So we get this working,
we have the trajectory,

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.130
we really want to run
10,000 trajectories,

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.530
because all we're doing is
sampling from the probability,

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.020
just the distribution of time.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.315
So we need to run
zillions of them.

00:47:57.315 --> 00:47:58.690
So this whole
thing we just wrote

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:02.562
would be inside a loop that
runs a lot of different cases,

00:48:02.562 --> 00:48:05.020
because every time you run
this, because the random number,

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.150
you're going to get a
different trajectory.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.060
And what you care about is
some kind of average behavior.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.190
Or you might want to know
what's the percentage

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.980
chance that I'm going to have
[INAUDIBLE] oxidized and die?

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.110
So you might say I
want to count what

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.610
fraction of the
trajectories end up

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.620
with number of peroxide
greater than some number, that

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:22.840
means I'm dead.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.090
And if that probability
is too high,

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.057
then I know I'm in big trouble.

00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:28.390
So that'd be one possible thing.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.670
You might have whatever
objective function you want,

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.030
but you need to run a lot to get
good statistics for anything.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.000
So you're gonna have to
embed this whole calculation

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.980
inside a loop, and
then, you're going

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.160
to get a zillion of
these trajectories out.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.290
And you figure out how are you
going to analyze them in order

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.870
to figure out what you want?

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:52.570
So one way is if you could
add the trajectories up--

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:54.770
so I have a trajectory--

00:48:54.770 --> 00:49:01.380
suppose I have the
number roh's versus time.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.860
And I do it once,
and I have none.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.443
Then I have one, and then I have
two, and then, I wait longer,

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:06.840
and I get three.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.770
And then, I wait
longer, I get four.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.340
Whatever, something like that.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.700
That's what it really looks
like for one trajectory.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.250
And then, the next
time I run it,

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.470
it starts in a slightly
different time.

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:21.170
And this time it runs longer
before something else happens.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:25.522
And then, it gets here, and
then maybe, it goes over here.

00:49:25.522 --> 00:49:26.980
And I have a lot
of them like that.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.950
I have 10,000 trajectories,
all look like that.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.945
So if I could add them,
then I can do an average,

00:49:34.945 --> 00:49:36.486
to get an average
trajectory, so that

00:49:36.486 --> 00:49:38.060
would be one possible thing.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.960
Or I might want to histogram,
so I might pick one time point.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.420
So like after 20 minutes,
I want a histogram

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.910
of what this looks
like here or here.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.515
One of them has four
peroxides, and one of them

00:49:53.515 --> 00:49:54.630
has five peroxides.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.400
And then the other 9,999--

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.170
some of the three,
some of the whatever.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.320
Yes, question?

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:04.960
you're not gonna get
the same time points--

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.950
WILLIAM GREEN JR: You're not
going to get the same time

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:06.825
points, that's right.

00:50:06.825 --> 00:50:08.847
So see the first
time it stopped,

00:50:08.847 --> 00:50:11.430
the first time point was here,
the second time, the first time

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:12.610
point was here.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.120
And they'll all be different.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.970
So one is I was asking
a few of the students

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:19.300
before the class
started, there's

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.920
got to be a program
in MATLAB that

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:25.420
will let you generate these kind
of plots with the flat lines.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.250
Or even a linear
interpolation would be OK too.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.382
But you need to have
some way to add them up

00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:33.090
as continuous functions,
because they all

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.215
have different time points.

00:50:34.215 --> 00:50:38.670
So that's one practical
issue about it,

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.280
because you want to pick some
special time you care about,

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.140
and you want to know what
does the trajectory say,

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.390
what does this trajectory say?

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.061
But you actually only
have numbers here,

00:50:46.061 --> 00:50:48.060
just really you have that
number and this number

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:48.726
and this number.

00:50:48.726 --> 00:50:50.570
That's all you got.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:51.374
Yeah?

00:50:51.374 --> 00:50:54.138
AUDIENCE: You can plot
like a-- an out of time

00:50:54.138 --> 00:51:00.507
to get to n amount of roh's and
then, that would be [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:00.507 --> 00:51:02.590
WILLIAM GREEN JR: OK, so
then you plot [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:04.030
versus time instead,
that's right.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:06.190
So that you just think
of what you want.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.810
You're going to have all
this trajectory information.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.040
And then you need to figure
out what do you want, and then,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.190
what are you going to plot?

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:12.250
And what are you
trying to compute?

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.410
And you might want to
compute not only the number

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.720
but the standard deviation of
that number, because you don't

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.740
know how many
trajectories you have

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.281
to run before the
center of deviation

00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:21.920
is narrow enough that
you'll be confident with it.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.700
So this is a general problem
with this whole approach--

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.130
is that what you're
getting out are just

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.550
samples of things that happen.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:29.830
It's just like if you
were doing a Monte Carlo,

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:31.990
and you just got some
of the energy values

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:34.830
from the hydrogen peroxide
calculation you guys did,

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:36.580
you have 47 of
those energy values.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.240
What are you going
to do with that?

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.750
So you have to
figure out, how are

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:40.360
you going to take
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.193
of this calculation.

00:51:41.193 --> 00:51:44.740
It's sampling from the real
solution, so it should be OK.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.520
But what is it?

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.370
How are you going to handle
that and use it as a means--

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.070
it's sort of like as if you
ran a zillion experiments,

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.980
and then, what would you
do with all that data?

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.765
So that's like issue number one.

00:51:55.765 --> 00:52:00.170
Now alternatively, you can
rewrite this as the master

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.400
equation and solve it as
an ODE, in which case,

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:10.420
you'll get explicitly p
of each of these ends.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:17.290
So n rad, nroh time--

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:18.790
it would be continuous
in principle,

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.373
but actually, the
ODE solver gives you

00:52:20.373 --> 00:52:22.580
out random time points also.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.590
So you get a similar kind of
thing out from the ODE solver,

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.600
except it'll give
you probability

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.700
for every possible
range of these guys.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.283
So if you have one radical, two
radicals, three radicals, four

00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:35.650
radical, fie radicals,
and number of peroxides

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.194
from one to 1,000, or however
many peroxides you get,

00:52:39.194 --> 00:52:40.360
you're going to get numbers.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.651
So you have all these numbers,
all these probabilities,

00:52:42.651 --> 00:52:43.460
at different times.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.260
Again, what are you
going to do with that?

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.430
So one thing people do a
lot is they would plot, say,

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:55.930
the number of roh's versus time.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.350
So at different time
points, compute the average

00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.640
over all your trajectories.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.140
Were with, if you
had this solution,

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:12.054
you can compute that
as nrooh, p, nrooh.

00:53:12.054 --> 00:53:14.220
So like this, you're gonna
have some kind of average

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.620
if you do it that way.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.320
And either one are fine, but you
have to think of what you want,

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.002
and then in both cases,
you'll probably be

00:53:20.002 --> 00:53:20.860
interested in the dispersion.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.450
So you [INAUDIBLE] want to
worry about the n squared too.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.280
We'll talk more
about this on Monday.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.360
All right and I posted
a homework problem

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.230
that was given last year
about this, for Kinetic Monte

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:31.400
Carlo for catalysis.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.370
It's used a lot in
heterogeneous catalysis.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:38.300
And if you have extra time,
feel free to do the problem.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.870
It's a really good problem.

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:41.870
Those of you who are
feeling like you don't have

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.244
any extra time, and you're
about to kill yourself, please

00:53:44.244 --> 00:53:45.559
don't kill yourself.

00:53:45.559 --> 00:53:47.100
And instead, just
send an email to me

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.220
or Professor Swan
asking for an extension.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.636
And we can give
you some more time

00:53:50.636 --> 00:53:52.970
to finish up the homeworks
that's due tonight.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.350
All right, talk to you

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.900
later.

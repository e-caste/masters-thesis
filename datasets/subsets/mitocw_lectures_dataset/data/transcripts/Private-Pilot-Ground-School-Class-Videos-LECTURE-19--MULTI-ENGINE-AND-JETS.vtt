00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:17.470
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Welcome back.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.600
I hope you've got your coffee.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.520
I see somebody has a muffin.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.170
They'll be in a
carb coma, Francis,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.960
I'm relying on you to answer
all the hard questions.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.080
That's not authorized.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.220
All right, so
multi-engine jets--

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.320
the piston twin,
the good news is,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.820
when both engines
are spinning, it's

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.290
easier to fly than a single.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.530
Because you don't need
as much right rudder

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.740
or really any right rudder.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.290
It doesn't have all those
left turning tendencies,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.170
necessarily.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.770
The training and rating,
especially the Seminole,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.320
which has
counter-rotating props--

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.120
all your training for
a multi-engine airplane

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.550
is flying around on one engine.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.050
Because flying
around on two engines

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.200
is pretty much the same.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.020
So basically, almost
all the flight time

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.350
that you accumulate during
your multi-engine training

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.160
will be with one engine pulled
back to idle or, in some cases,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.780
stopped altogether.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.090
You have six power levers in
a twin-engine piston airplane,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
two for throttle, two for
mixture, and two for prop.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
You may also have cowl flaps to
bring more or less cooling air

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.960
into these piston engines.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.850
By FAA certification
requirements,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.610
as I think I mentioned
earlier, there

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.190
is no required climb rate.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.020
It may be a truly crummy
airplane on one engine.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.390
So that's why people
say that second engine

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.990
either takes you to the
scene of the accident.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.940
One engine expert,
Mike Bush, he said--

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.190
he came to appreciate
the Cirrus parachute.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.940
It's not like having that
extra engine out there

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.270
on the wing trying to
kill you all the time.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.390
It just waits there
quietly until you need it.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.020
Piston twins have an
illustrious history.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.840
Here is a Aero
Commander piston-driven

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.023
twin that was actually
Eisenhower's Air Force One.

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.440
This also tells you something
of the growth of government.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.660
When Eisenhower was
president and wanted

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.400
to go to a smaller
airport, this is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.480
how he would go, in an airplane
designed for about six people.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.280
OK, this is probably
what you'll be flying,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.980
which is the Piper Seminole.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.160
It is unusual in that
the props counter rotate.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.410
And that has some
advantages that are

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.040
beyond the scope of this talk.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.640
It's a design from the '70s
based on designs from the '50s.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.870
Where the problems happen--

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.130
so have a look here.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.550
Can anybody immediately see
what one problem might be?

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.460
I'd say, the left
engine quits, and you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.198
have to manipulate these.

00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:00.740
What happens?

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:07.410
PHILIP GREENSPUN: You're
manipulating the controls

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.040
for the good engine instead
of for the failed engine

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.600
inadvertently.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.250
So it's just an interface
that's overly complex

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.450
given human frailties.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.090
So, what do you have to
do if an engine quits?

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.320
You don't want the
drag of that propeller

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.090
out there that's not being
driven by the engine.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.952
So you push all of
the levers forward

00:03:32.952 --> 00:03:35.160
and try to get maximum power
out of your good engine.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.980
Push everything forward.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.730
You'll have to put in some
rudder to correct the yaw,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.430
because the airplane
is going to be pulled

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.890
to one side or the
other depending on which

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.570
engine is still running.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.640
And then there's the old
adage, dead foot, dead engine.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.510
So if your left foot
is flat on the floor

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.930
and it's your right
rudder that's in,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.010
then you know that it's the
left engine that has failed.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.770
Then you try to
verify the dead engine

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.180
by pulling back that throttle.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.640
So you'll say, OK, I think
the left engine's failed.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.420
I'm going to try monkeying
with the left throttle.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.670
And if that has no effect on
the flight characteristics,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.700
you verify that it's
the left engine.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.330
Then you feather the dead engine
by pulling the prop control

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.210
all the way back.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.680
If you're in a
two-pilot crew, you'll

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.780
get your co-pilot to verify.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.680
I have my hand on the
left prop control.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.970
And you pull that back,
close the cowl flaps.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.670
And only now do
you have any chance

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.470
of getting an actual climb.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.980
So imagine if this engine
failed shortly after takeoff.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.020
It's a lot of stuff
to do very quickly.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.670
You have to do it all right.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.860
And if you miss even
one of these things,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.040
you may not be able
to clear obstacles

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.300
at the end of the runway.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.420
Now, of course, your
typical piston twin,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.698
takeoff is a stressful time
for an engine 100% power.

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:05.490
But there's definitely
more engine failures

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.900
that occur en route.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.160
So the generally negative
impression of piston twins

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.860
might have to be revised if
your primary mission is flying

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.570
around the Caribbean islands.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.710
You might, in that case,
actually say, well,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.680
I'd rather have
that second engine.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.140
Is this within human
capability, that sequence

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.690
that you just saw?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.140
Yes, in World War II
when engines weren't

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.740
being made with as much
precision as they are now,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.230
it would be ordinary to
have one out of four engines

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.515
or one out of two engines
fail on any given mission.

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:38.640
But they also got it wrong.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.670
There is one very famous
guy, Louis Zamperini.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.610
Some of you may have
seen a movie about him.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.130
He floated in a
raft for 47 days.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.540
I think that was a record at
the time for survival at sea.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.660
He was on a
four-engined aircraft.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.000
And one engineer quit.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.232
And I think there were about
four pilots in the cockpit.

00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:02.190
Remember we talked about
a flight engineer also

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.693
being an airman.

00:06:03.693 --> 00:06:05.610
So if we count the flight
engineer as a pilot,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.910
there were at least three
or four experts up front.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.320
And as a team, they
feathered the wrong engine.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.590
So they killed a second
engine that was actually good.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.965
And now they had two
engines working on only one

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.840
side of the airplane.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.850
And it was uncontrollable.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.900
So they went in the water
through human error.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.517
And Cape Air has a
great track record.

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.850
They've had a handful of
engine failures over the years.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.242
They fly piston twins all day,
every day in the Caribbean

00:06:36.242 --> 00:06:37.200
and around New England.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.490
And when they have a
problem, usually it's

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.448
not a complete failure.

00:06:39.448 --> 00:06:42.630
But maybe there's an ugly
indication on one engine.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.130
So they'll shut it down.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.900
But they do a lot of
recurrent training.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.330
That's what they fly
all day, every day.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.820
The typical family airplane
doesn't get flown as often.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.830
And the pilot isn't
as proficient.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.190
So the capable twins are
very inexpensive now,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.800
except for the Beechcraft Baron,
which is the most sought after.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.340
They're a little more
expensive to insure

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.170
than the comparable single.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.290
Just the other day, I got a
quote from my local insurance

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.900
agency called Plane Insurance.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.380
And we found out
that if you look

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.040
at a $200,000
aircraft being flown

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.940
by a pilot that has 250
hours of experience in type

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.135
in that exact aircraft
and with a million dollars

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:29.590
of smooth liability,
that means no sublimit.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.817
So if there's just
one passenger,

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.900
they would pay, oh, a
million dollars for injuries

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.220
to that one passenger.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.200
Some policies have, like,
$100,000 per person sublimit.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.310
Anyway, it was about 50% more
for the Baron, $3,700 a year

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.930
versus $2,500.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.460
So there you have it.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.180
Again, it's not insanely risky.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.770
You can quantify the risk.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.540
The insurance company has.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.340
But it is riskier.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.110
OK.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.800
We have a lot of engineering
geniuses in this class and one

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.010
physics genius--

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.510
science.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.570
Which one was it?

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.710
AUDIENCE: Brain in cog.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.830
PHILIP GREENSPUN: That's
close enough to physics,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.600
brain in cog.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.530
It takes a lot of physics
to make your neurons fire.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.820
Obviously, my neurons
aren't firing very well.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.750
So, what's the limit to
a piston engine's power?

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.070
Why is it that we can't
get 6,000 horsepower out

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.100
of our piston engine?

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.266
What do you guys think?

00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:30.180
AUDIENCE: Cooling.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.555
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Cooling is one.

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:33.400
Sure.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.970
What else?

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.520
What's fundamentally limiting
our ability to produce power?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.145
Remember, all the
power that we produce

00:08:38.145 --> 00:08:44.716
is by burning fuel
and oxygen. Aziz?

00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:45.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.870
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Size, yeah.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.600
I think that's a good insight.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.790
It's the size of the cylinder.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.270
You only have so much fuel
and air that you can combust.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.150
And once you've blown all
of that up, what do you got?

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.540
Nothing.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.950
So if you want to know
why you should never

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.600
be like the Silicon
Valley heroes

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.630
and never hire anybody
over the age of 30,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.370
the inventor of the modern jet
engine was only 23 years old,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.920
I believe, at the
time that the patent

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.910
was filed over in England.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.010
He was a cadet when he
conceived of the idea

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.850
at the Royal Air College.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.090
And he said, well,
look, these pistons--

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.940
no matter how high up you
go, no matter what you do,

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.390
all you can ever do is burn
the volume of air and fuel

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.980
that's inside the cylinder.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.810
So, what if we just adapt
this gas turbine, which

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.660
has already been invented?

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.530
It was kind of invented in
1791 but not really practical

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.920
to fabricate at the time.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.920
But look, we're just
sucking in all of this air.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.310
We can probably get 20 times
as much air in if we just

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.380
vacuum it in, and suck
it into a turbine,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.250
and then light it on fire.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.550
So that was the idea,
the fundamental insight

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.730
for why a gas turbine is
going to be a better machine

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.670
for propelling aircraft.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.170
He struggled with funding.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.740
So you can see, the
patent was filed in 1930.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:16.110
And it was only in 1941
that it finally got flown.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.110
And that's a good lesson
for you entrepreneurs.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.620
A lot of MIT startups
have the characteristic,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.320
but they're a bit too early.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.430
I remember, in 1994,
I built the world's

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.010
first electronic medical
record system that

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.700
had a web interface.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.700
So that had zero
value at the time.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.620
And about 10 years later, that
was a multi-billion dollar

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.510
idea.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.860
So yeah, Whittle died in
relative obscurity in 1996.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.680
So nobody else liked
this idea at the time.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.120
I'll let you read that quote--

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.610
not totally wrong, of course.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.620
Because it did take quite
a bit of engineering

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.480
to make it truly practical.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.950
But that didn't take as
long as people thought.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.620
All right, you saw
this figure before.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.060
This is the modern turbo
jet or turbo fan engine,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.210
where you have
this bypass error.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:23.220
So the outer ring
is devoted to air

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.890
that really never
goes through and gets

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.180
burned in the power section.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.813
And that provides a lot of
additional propulsion for not

00:11:32.813 --> 00:11:33.980
a whole lot of extra energy.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.590
So these are much more efficient
than the early pure turbo jet.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.860
So just to remind you, you
have the compressor section,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.590
where you have air
being squeezed.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.575
Now you introduce some fuel.

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:49.840
It catches on fire from the
extreme heat or the igniters

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.250
if you're just starting up.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.320
That drives these
power turbines.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.220
And some of the spinning
from the power turbines

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.190
goes back to spin the
compressor wheels, as well

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.180
as the fan in front, which is
kind of like the propeller.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.913
All right, what about
having to turbo jet engines?

00:12:07.913 --> 00:12:10.330
A lot of people like to see
two engines on their aircraft,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.240
especially airline passengers.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.330
If you have an engine
failure, what do you do?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.840
The answer is,
pretty much nothing.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.690
If it hasn't been done
automatically for you already,

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.810
you can advance
the thrust levers.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.090
If the airplane is the
yawing, that sometimes

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.870
is automatically corrected for
you to a substantial extent

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.460
by the yaw damper.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.710
You will step on the rudder
to do the natural thing

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.950
and bring the nose back pointed
to where you want it pointed.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.070
And you'll keep climbing nicely.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.525
You've arranged
everything both in terms

00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:46.900
of the design of the aircraft
and the weight at which you

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.250
took off so that, no matter
the environmental conditions,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.630
you will be able to climb.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.720
And you will be able
to clear the obstacles.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.720
This can be a challenge.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.150
If you're taking off out of
a mountainous, high altitude,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.630
hot airport, you're not going
to have a full load of fuel

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.408
and a full load of
people and bags.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:05.950
But by regulation,
you're going to be

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.910
able to clear the terrain
safely even on one engine.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.840
Why is it so much easier?

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.950
You don't have a propeller
that'll drag back a wing.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.870
And therefore, there's no
urgency about feathering.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.350
You also have a little
bit less of the crazy yaw.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.410
Because the engines are,
in some aircraft, pretty

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.050
close to the fuselage.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.830
So basically, you can still
apply that cardinal rule

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.270
of flying jets.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.000
If the switch has dust
on it, don't touch it.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.028
So you don't have to
take immediate action.

00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:43.570
All right, if it's
turbo jet powered,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.600
though, you do need
specific training.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.700
And you have to pass a check
ride specific to that aircraft.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.190
So most of you guys,
except for Francis,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.940
believe that Captain Sully was
all by himself in the A320.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.720
but actually, anything that's
more than about a 10 seater

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.520
almost always
requires two pilots.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.830
And according to the
type certificate,

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.060
it's not even legal to operate
even the larger business

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.970
jets with one pilot.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:20.340
There is an old FAR
91.5, I believe,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.730
that says there has to be a
proficiency check annually

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.930
for the pilot in command
of a two-pilot aircraft.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.210
And more recently,
the regulations

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.040
were updated for
single-pilot turbo jets

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.560
so that a check ride
has to be done annually,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.307
which is not really that
different from the insurance

00:14:39.307 --> 00:14:40.640
requirements of annual training.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.730
They just made it a
little more formalized

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.830
with FAA bureaucracy.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.960
All right, turbo jets
that you might own--

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.350
the single pilot business
jet with a straight wing--

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.150
they said initially,
the Cessna Citation

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.760
was so slow that birds were
hitting it from behind.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.700
But sometimes
safety and having it

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.610
be easy to operate by
people of ordinary skill

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.010
and people of lower skill
levels is better than

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.410
getting that last
50 knots of speed.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.930
And that's what
Cessna figured out.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.910
So they're still kind of
a leader in this area.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.310
They produced the
Cessna Mustang, which

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.530
you see there at the right.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.900
Some of the Microsoft
folks, they spun off

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.360
a design called the Eclipse.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.390
It was supposed to have these
new cruise-missile-inspired

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.540
engines from Williams.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.540
The engines didn't work.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.030
So the 1500 nautical
mile airplane

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.350
became a 900 nautical mile
airplane with a Pratt & Whitney

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.730
more conventional
designed engine

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.100
that's used on some of
these other designs.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.500
The Embraer Phenom 100
has the same engines

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.050
essentially as the
Mustang, same family.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.640
HondaJet has an
innovative engine

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.430
designed by GE and Honda.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.100
These have all pretty much
been business failures.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.830
And the answer to that is the
fixed costs of jet ownership

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:02.600
are so high you can't just get
a T hangar for $800 a month.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.870
You may have to pay at
one of the busier airports

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.260
$40,000 a year to have
an FBO hangar it for you.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.620
The insurance company will
require simulator training

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.280
annually.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.190
And you'll probably
have to have two pilots

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.920
as a practical matter
go through training.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.170
Insurance will be expensive,
because the whole value

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.710
is high.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.990
If you wreck a $5 million
airplane or a $10 million

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.860
airplane, that's a bad day
for the insurance company.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.450
You get charged a lot
more for landing fees

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.190
and parking at airports.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.483
When you're a little Cessna,
they give you a break,

00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:41.900
because they don't want you
saying anything bad about them

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.550
on airnav.com.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.170
But if you show up
in a Gulfstream,

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.880
they figure you probably
have a credit card somewhere.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.100
So yeah, the Mustang,
they actually

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.930
stopped production
of that plane.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.810
The Phenom 100 is still
going from Embraer.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:02.320
But basically, I think
the Phenom 300 is--

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.349
it holds about
nine or 10 people.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.790
And I think it weighs somewhere
in the 15,000 to 20,000

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.180
pound range.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.349
At gross, those
are the airplanes

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.095
that seem to be popular.

00:17:15.095 --> 00:17:18.829
The Phenom 300 is
about $9 million new.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.650
And $3 to $5 million
used applies, including

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.349
the things like the Cessna CJ3.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.339
A $3 million plane
could be a CJ3.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.590
All right, what about
single-engine jets?

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.305
The problem is they're more
vulnerable to engine failure.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.680
Jet engines are
a little bit more

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.010
vulnerable to failure from,
say, a bird strike or something

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.090
than a piston engine.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.410
And therefore, you need some way
of dealing with the consequence

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.330
of having that engine fail.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.800
The Cirrus jet is pretty slow.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.950
So it could actually be
landed off the airport,

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.010
perhaps, without
too much damage.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.470
But it has a parachute in case.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:01.130
And F-16 and other fighter
jets that are single engine,

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.920
they obviously have
ejection seats.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.080
Twin turboprops--
let's talk about those.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.870
So if you want to land
on a short runway--

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.093
we talked about turboprop
engines, I think, on day one.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.010
They can produce a
tremendous amount of power.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.363
So you can have a much
bigger, heavier airplane.

00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:20.030
But because they're
driving a propeller,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.488
you get to take
off and land short.

00:18:21.488 --> 00:18:26.790
They developed thrust very
effectively at low speeds.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.930
And the prop is a huge
drag, so when you land,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.110
it kind of slows down
and stops immediately

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.730
or almost immediately.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:40.243
So the King Air from
1964 to the present

00:18:40.243 --> 00:18:41.660
with these Pratt
& Whitney engines

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.790
that were developed in the
very end of the '50s, the PT6.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.220
Those have been hugely popular.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.870
When you hit a bird, it's
a problem for the bird

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.970
but not usually
for the propeller.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:01.100
The King Airs and this ATR,
have an auto-feather system.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.350
If one engine loses
power, the propeller

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.890
will automatically go to this
knife-edge configuration.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.810
I should have said
what feathering is.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.220
You twist the
propeller blades so

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.250
that they're edge to the wind
instead of flat to the wind.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:19.700
So you dramatically reduce
the drag of the propeller.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.940
So that airplane actually
took care of itself

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.400
or should have taken care
of itself pretty well.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.200
You can read about that crash.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.820
I think it was in Taiwan.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.300
But the pilots decided to take
heroic, immediate action--

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.160
or at least, one
of the pilots did--

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.180
and shut down the good engine
instead of just leaving

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.380
well enough alone.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.640
OK, single-engine
turboprops-- as these engines

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.650
got more refined
and more reliable,

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.370
if you look at
the PT6 design, it

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.510
has all kinds of
tubes, and hoses,

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.930
and vacuum going from one
place to another and bleed air.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.480
You'd be surprised that
it's as reliable as it is.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.270
But they supposedly
don't really have

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:03.250
to be shut down for a problem
or fail more than about

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.380
once every 300,000,
400,000, or 500,000 hours.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:13.570
So after that insight,
people said, let's just

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.830
put one of them in.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.020
And we don't need
that second engine.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.990
It'll save a ton of money.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.250
So the Cessna Caravan is
a great example of that.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.980
That's that sort
of boxy cargo plane

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.490
that you saw on floats
in the other video.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.650
For personal planes
that are pressurized

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.410
and more comfortable, the Piper
Meridian, which is down here--

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:39.100
this is my friend Arnold,
who is at Hanscom.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.670
He says he funded his
airplanes, because he

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:47.210
was practicing during the
golden age of gynecology.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.390
And that's what
enabled him to afford

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:54.060
his fancy, pressurized Pipers.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.470
The TBM is a French
design that's

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.090
considerably preferred
to the Piper,

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.790
but it's a lot more expensive.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.640
And the Swiss
Pilatus PC-12 is kind

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.640
of a good airplane for a mixture
of family use and charter use.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.470
The Piper and the TBM are
too small to justify all

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.270
the machinery around charter.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.490
All right, so
actually, old King Airs

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.600
are cheaper than these
single-engine airplanes,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.620
but they cost a
little more to run.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.370
All right, when you're
maintaining a jet--

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.930
I think I mentioned
this earlier--

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.950
the manufacturer's guidance will
supersede those catch-all rules

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:35.170
of a 100-hour inspection for an
airplane operated commercially

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.490
or the annual inspection for
an airplane operated privately.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.750
It can get expensive.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.790
On one of those
Cessna Citation jets

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.760
that I mentioned,
coming out with $100,000

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.040
bill from the annual
would not be unexpected.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.935
You usually have a time
limit on the whole airframe.

00:21:56.935 --> 00:21:59.140
And if it's pressurized,
it's getting

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.880
expanded and
contracted, expanded

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.310
and contracted and a
little bit of metal fatigue

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.030
on every flight.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.170
So you may have a limit
on the number of cycles,

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.140
the number of times
that's happened,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.220
and also on the number of hours.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.380
So a 12,000-hour or 20,000-hour
airframe life limit might be

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:15.880
common.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.510
For the Pilatuses,
it's 20,000 hours.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.260
And then they have
life extension programs

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.410
where they tear the whole
thing apart and replace

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.410
some structures or, at least,
look at every structure.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.860
People have extended them out
to about 32,000 hours, I think,

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.420
now.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.590
There's cycle limits,
also, on the jet engines.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.150
So the turbine blades and
stuff and disks, every time

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.860
they're started and
shut down, there's

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.570
a huge amount of
thermal cycling.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.810
So they say, look, after
you've done that 15,000 times,

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.400
you got to throw that wheel out.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.830
And that wheel inside the
turboprop could be $100,000.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.170
If you guys ever--

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.630
it may seem hard to believe
now that MIT has stripped you

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.700
of all of your
savings, but if you

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.190
do have a little bit of
money at some future date

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.860
and you want to get a type
rating for your airplane,

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.510
by far the cheapest
type rating you

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.732
get will be for a big airplane.

00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:09.190
So it turns out,
if you want to pay

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.320
flight safety for the
Gulfstream rating,

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.020
or a Cessna Mustang
rating, or whatever,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.170
those are pretty expensive.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.990
They're relatively rare.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.500
Boeing 737s and
Airbus A320s, so many

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.030
were made that there's just
a wide variety of simulators

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.960
all over the world.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:32.200
And for about $10,000, you can
jump in and get your instrument

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.700
proficiency back up to snuff,
as well as have a lot of fun.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.610
All right, so as a summary,
it's a good challenge

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.100
to get that multi-engine rating.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.190
I wouldn't recommend
practicing it

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.920
unless you have an unusual
application, like you

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.630
live in the Caribbean,
and you want

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.850
to get from island to island.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.180
If you're nervous
and somebody says,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.000
I don't feel comfortable
depending on this

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.790
five-year-old, 1,000-hour piston
engine that's in front of us,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.150
the answer I think these days is
it's better to get an airplane

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.710
that has a ballistic parachute
as your backup than to have

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.320
the second engine as a backup.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.910
And while you're formulating
your questions, I'll show you.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.490
On the top left is
a French design.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.506
That's called a Cri-Cri.

00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:27.940
It seats one person.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.555
And it's, I believe,
fully aerobatic.

00:24:29.555 --> 00:24:31.930
So you can do all kinds of
crazy maneuvers in the Cri-Cri

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.130
if you want.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.280
Each of those engines might
be only 30 horsepower or 15.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.870
You can look it up.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.820
It's a truly crazy design.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.577
Here is an AirCam
that's an open cockpit.

00:24:44.577 --> 00:24:45.910
Although, this one has a canopy.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.790
That's from the Oshkosh
seaplane base, a great airplane

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.860
for flying low and slow over
remote, somewhat wet locations.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.180
Here's an L-39 Czech
military trainer.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.620
And there's a company called--

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.330
I think it was called
Code 1 Aviation.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.310
They had that at
Oshkosh, where they

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.910
took a regular American business
jet engine out of a Hawker,

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.400
and they stuffed
it into the L-39

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.010
because it's cheaper to
operate and maintain it

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.770
as a lower fuel burn than
the military engines.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.670
So you end up getting a lot
longer range out of your L-39

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.780
if you want to--

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.030
those L-39s are only a couple
hundred thousand dollars

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.720
for a nice one.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.360
So you can actually own a
jet that's fully aerobatic,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.950
and cool, and look
like-- people will

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:32.050
think it's an F-16 for less
money than buying a Cirrus.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.380
On the left is the
ramp at Teterboro.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.390
I said I was talking about it.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.265
If you're working
for Bernie Sanders

00:25:39.265 --> 00:25:41.140
and you want to start
a revolution in the US,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.690
I would recommend starting
it right at the Teterboro

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.055
airport and just film the
people getting in and out

00:25:46.055 --> 00:25:46.930
of their Gulfstreams.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.805
And this is Meridian.

00:25:47.805 --> 00:25:51.820
This is the lowest-cost
FBO at Teterboro.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.770
And that's what the
ramp looks like.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:57.520
If you want to combine two
piston engines in a jet,

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.250
I believe each of
these of is a Yak-55.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.930
And some airshow performer at
Oshkosh glued them together

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:14.700
and put a jet engine in the
middle and calls it a Yak-110.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.660
So there you have it.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.047
That combines everything
from this talk.

00:26:18.047 --> 00:26:18.630
Any questions?

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.340
Or should we jump
right into night?

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.410
Who wants to fly a jet?

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.818
Excellent.

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.746
AUDIENCE: So you said Cessna
Caravans are single engine.

00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:32.109
I know they fly those
commercially in Hawaii

00:26:32.109 --> 00:26:33.075
island to island.

00:26:33.075 --> 00:26:34.880
How do you think
they justify that?

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.838
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:26:35.838 --> 00:26:40.030
The question is, is it OK to
fly a single engine over water

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:46.135
in Hawaii in a Cessna
Caravan with only one engine?

00:26:46.135 --> 00:26:51.550
Well, first of all, the last
crash of a Caravan in Hawaii

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:54.430
from an engine failure, they
operated it just a few hours

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.240
beyond the manufacturer's
TBO under a special program

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.635
they had approved by the FAA.

00:26:59.635 --> 00:27:02.560
They were not doing
anything illegal.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.690
Everybody survived the crash.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:05.860
One person was killed.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.890
Does anybody remember who
was killed in that crash,

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:12.510
and what was special
about that person?

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.010
AUDIENCE: It was a
flight attendant.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.718
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Not
a flight attendant.

00:27:15.718 --> 00:27:22.520
It was a woman who was a
state of Hawaii employee.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.250
What was special about her?

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.820
She was the person who
certified Barack Obama's birth

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.930
certificate as genuine.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.970
Think about that.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.670
So anyway, if you
really open up the PT6

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.170
and the manually would say, no,
I'm not going to allow this.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.128
And I think in Europe--

00:27:41.128 --> 00:27:44.510
Europe wouldn't even allow
a single-engine charter IFR

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.620
until just a year or two ago.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.740
They said, no, this is too much.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.530
So I don't know.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:51.840
It's a balancing of risk.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.320
I don't think it's
an unacceptable risk.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.100
People with Pilatuses, they
will go back and forth to Europe

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.980
regularly as individuals.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.140
But yeah, maybe there should
be a warning to passengers.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.330
We only got one engine.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.510
Thanks for buying a ticket.

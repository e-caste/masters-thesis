00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.150
ANDREW LO: Any questions
from last lecture?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.330
Where we left off last time
was the adaptive markets

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.860
hypothesis.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.720
The fact that markets are not
always in everywhere efficient,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.620
but rather they satisfy the
following six properties

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.590
that I listed at the
end of last lecture.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.230
Individuals act in
their own self-interest,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.300
but they make mistakes.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.340
However, they learn and
adapt, and competition drives

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.160
that adaptation and innovation.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.720
Natural selection,
essentially, is the mechanism

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.620
that shapes the survival of
the heuristics And in the end,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.670
the only thing that
matters is survival.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.220
Now I illustrated how
heuristics develop

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.360
by giving you an example of
the problem of getting dressed

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.430
in the morning.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.540
And I pointed out
that each of us

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.240
have our own heuristics
that have been developed

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.150
over many, many
years of selection

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.220
of various different sorts.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.530
So when you take
this all together

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.130
and you put them
into a framework that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
tries to focus on
understanding market dynamics,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.740
you get a number of
implications that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.740
are actually quite different
from that of efficient markets.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.990
Let me tell you what they are.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.740
I'll give you some examples.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.390
One of the implications is
that the risk-reward trade-off

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.300
the relationship between risk
and expected rate of return,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.210
like the CAPM's
security market line.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.500
That's not stable over
time or over circumstances,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.530
because individual
preferences are not stable

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.100
over time or over circumstances.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.440
I'll give you an
example of that.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.840
Anybody know somebody who
has lived through the Great

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.200
Depression, OK, so grandparents
or great-grandparents?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.080
My guess is that if
you talk to them,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.317
or if you even
observe their habits,

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.400
they're actually quite
different from your parents

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.190
and yourselves in
terms of how frugal

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.700
they, are how careful
they are with money,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.520
with resources, even something
as simple as turning off

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.650
the lights.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.430
A friend of mine is a customer
a very wealthy family.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.500
They own a private business.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.900
And so their family's
net worth today

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.820
is probably in the
order of $300 million,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.270
which, even in today's
economy is worth a lot.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.810
Actually, it's worth more than
what it used to be worth now.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
And so this family, the
patriarch, the matriarch

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.000
is their grandmother, who lived
through the Great Depression.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.080
And she lives in Lower
Manhattan in a relatively small,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.720
nondescript apartment,
despite the fact

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.260
that the family, you
know, my friend's parents,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.120
live in a beautiful penthouse
apartment on Park Avenue.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.070
And they keep asking
the grandmother

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.000
to move in with them.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.992
And she refuses.

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:29.200
She just thinks it's a waste.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.570
It's embarrassing.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.100
And when she comes to visit
them, she'll take the bus.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.320
She refuses to take taxis
just from Lower Manhattan

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.040
to Midtown.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.996
And so, you know, my friend,
you know, pleads with her.

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:47.620
You know, Nana, why
are you doing this?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.450
You know, we have more money
than we'll ever be able to use.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.700
You can afford to take a taxi.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.720
Let us send a car for you.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.540
Why do you do this?

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.340
It's dangerous for you to
take the subway or the bus.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.970
And she's like 95 years old.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.270
And she says to
him, listen, Sonny.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.820
You don't remember
the days that I do,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.900
when I had to stand in line
and wait for my dinner,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.720
not knowing whether or not I
was going to get me by the time

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.130
I got to that end of that line.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.600
So don't you tell me that we
have more money than will ever

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.306
be able to spend.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.430
I'm sure you've heard that.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.013
Those of you who know people who
lived through the depression,

00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:29.620
you've heard that.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.080
These individuals were indelibly
altered by their experiences.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.290
They're not the same
person before, as after,

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.270
living through such
difficult times.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.770
And you're not going
to change them.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.530
So my friend has stopped trying.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.110
And so he just
does what he can in

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.910
order to make her life easier,
but realizing that she simply

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.280
can't enjoy the
same kinds of things

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.070
that he does, because she lived
through such traumatic times.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.870
So if you understand that,
if you acknowledge that there

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.260
are people that are indelibly
altered by tough times,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.150
then, in the same way, people
can be indelibly altered

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
by really good times as well.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.031
As I said last time, you learn
nothing from your successes,

00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:18.530
right?

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.450
Because you succeeded,
what's there to learn?

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.510
Do more of the same.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.370
But that affects the
way you think as well.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.560
And so what we think of as
this beautiful mathematical

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.770
relationship, this risk-reward
trade-off, the CAPM,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.300
the CAPM works if all of the
assumptions that I specified

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.820
are true.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.960
But those assumptions
are predicated

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.240
on people acting rationally.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.260
If people don't act rationally
for whatever reason,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.410
if they're emotionally
traumatized,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.830
if the balance between emotion
and logical deliberation

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.160
has been permanently
altered, then the theory

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.700
is not going to work.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.260
So you have to understand that
when you're looking at markets,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.970
you're looking at
the complexities

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.400
of the interactions among
various different people

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.060
with different balances
of logical deliberation

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.950
and emotional response.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.950
So one of the
things that says is

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.730
that risk premia,
the expected return

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.040
on risky assets as a whole,
is not a universal constant

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.530
like, you know, gravity.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.650
It changes over time
and over circumstances.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.410
It was going to
be quite different

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.370
if we had continuing prosperity
over the next five years

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.740
as to where we're
likely to be headed now.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.790
It's just different.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.250
We have a different path
that we're going to follow.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.830
And so as things change, market
dynamics will change with them.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.330
Yeah, Zeke.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.539
AUDIENCE: So last
time, we had talked

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.177
about when you give somebody
[INAUDIBLE] that [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:58.177 --> 00:06:58.677
and so on.

00:06:58.677 --> 00:07:01.140
And you said that lasts
for a couple of hours.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.785
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:04.650
AUDIENCE: So with combined
with what you're saying today,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.963
are you connecting
the two and suggesting

00:07:06.963 --> 00:07:13.000
that such huge events actually
change our biology permanently

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.676
for years?

00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:15.634
Or do you think that
there's a different reason

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:18.030
behind that sort of learning?

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.520
ANDREW LO: I'm saying
that it can change not so

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.620
much our biology,
but rather, it can

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.790
change our decision-making
abilities for years

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.090
to come, in the same way that
you know your grandmother

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.630
or great-grandmother
was indelibly affected

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.520
by living through
the Great Depression,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.580
or through the Holocaust, or
through some extraordinary

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.730
emotional trauma,
in the same way

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.780
we will be affected by these
sets of circumstances for years

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.541
to come.

00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.180
Right?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.310
That's it.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.116
Ingrid.

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:52.685
AUDIENCE: I was really
impressed about two weeks ago

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:57.480
that I heard the different
networks, the channel

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.355
lists trying to convince people
not to getting them to buy

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.480
Christmas presents,
and people are

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.300
going to complain because
they could not not

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.570
buy gifts to their kids.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.600
And where I come from,
if you don't have money,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.016
you don't have
money [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:17.505
So it was really surprising
to see how that consumption

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:20.150
mindset was so, so strong here.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.150
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.790
And you know, that's a very
unusual mindset for the United

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.330
States, because we are the
land of consumers, right?

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.270
I mean, consumption is
what drives this economy,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.309
for better or for worse.

00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:33.600
You know, that is what has
made this country as wealthy

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.740
as it has.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.400
And so, it is a very difficult
time when we actually

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.409
have to all pull back.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.900
And you know there are some
individuals that would argue

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.459
that you shouldn't pull back.

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.500
You should keep on spending,
because if everybody

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.250
keeps on spending, then
somehow, magically, we will be,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.770
stay richer.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.270
That doesn't quite work.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.660
There's an adding up
constraint somewhere.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.020
So wealth, if it's
lost, you know,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.490
it's lost in a certain sense.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.310
And you can't create
something out of nothing.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.220
But I think there are some
issues about government's role

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.942
in being able to maintain a
certain degree of spending.

00:09:07.942 --> 00:09:09.900
So we're going to get to
that in a few minutes.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.110
But you're absolutely right.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.030
This is a very big change
from where we were just

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.830
even a few months ago.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.220
Other implications
of adaptive markets

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.210
is that limited arbitrage,
the so-called free lunches

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.450
that we talked about, that
can exist from time to time.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.060
There are free
lunches on occasion,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.660
because you can think of the
free lunches as opportunities

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.060
that a certain group of
individuals in the economy

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.760
have identified
which may not last.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.400
And so over time, those
arbitrageurs end up

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.580
getting eaten away
by the arbitrageurs.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.090
But they still do exist
from time to time.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.830
Free lunch programs
may not exist,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.880
in other words consistent
arbitrageurs time and again.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.440
That is much, much more
difficult to come by.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.320
But as a result, strategies
will wax and wane

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.730
through different cycles.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.240
And the way it does so
is exactly the same way

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.580
that a beautiful, green
pasture can come and go

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.310
based upon ecological dynamics.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.870
In particular, a green pasture
becomes a favorite spot

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.840
for sheep to graze on.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.850
And after a while, as the sheep
graze and get fat and multiply,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.410
they have more and more
effect on that pasture.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.870
Pretty soon, with so many sheep
grazing on that same pasture,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.720
the pasture is depleted.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.320
And after it's
depleted, what happens

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.070
to the sheep population?

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.260
It declines.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.090
And the population declines,
the pasture grows back,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.250
and the cycle begins
all over again.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.870
Well, I have news for you.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.160
That pasture, you can
think of as profits.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.660
And the sheep, you can
think of as all of you.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.072
You're, the investors.

00:11:06.072 --> 00:11:08.280
And if it's profitable for
you to invest in something

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.160
you will keep doing it,
and doing it, and doing it

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.452
until there's no more pasture.

00:11:13.452 --> 00:11:15.660
That's what happened with
mortgage-backed securities.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.070
There's no more pasture now.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.222
It's pretty much gone.

00:11:18.222 --> 00:11:19.680
It's going to be
hard to make money

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.240
in that market for a while.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.330
So all the sheep, they're
going to go away now.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.510
And over time, it
will come back.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.150
It may take a while,
but it will come back.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.770
And that's where
cycles come from.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.750
It's the exact same mechanism.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.940
This is not an
analogy or a metaphor.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.340
I'm describing
exactly the mechanism

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:44.100
by which certain biological
entities interact

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.660
with their environment.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.220
And we are biological entities.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.390
We're creatures.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.160
And we interact in
our environment.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.010
The only difference
between us and sheep

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.680
is that we consume
dollars instead of grass.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.035
And so the dynamics are
really very much the same.

00:12:01.035 --> 00:12:02.910
And the bottom line, I
said, is that survival

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.070
is all that matters.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.660
What any business cares about
in general is surviving.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.820
And as you push
for survival, a lot

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.780
of the effects that you see in
typical evolutionary systems

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.050
will emerge in economies.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.930
So let me talk specifically
about some very, very

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.860
concrete examples of
these kinds of dynamics.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.910
I'll give you just a couple.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.030
The first example comes
from the hedge fund

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.660
industry, and in particular,
from very, very simple--

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.160
a simple observation about the
efficiency of the stock market.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.170
When we talked about the
random walk hypothesis

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.210
a few weeks ago, we
mentioned that the idea

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.170
behind the random walk
is that if prices fully

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.136
reflect all available
information, then certainly,

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:50.760
you shouldn't be able
to predict what's

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.250
going to happen
to prices tomorrow

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.700
based upon what happened
to prices last week, right?

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.480
In other words, just because
we had a positive return

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.660
over the last five days,
that positive return

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.180
shouldn't give you
any hint as to whether

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.120
or not the next five days
will be positive or negative,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.990
because all the information
of the last five days

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.790
has been incorporated
into today's price.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.060
So at every point in
time, it's a fair game.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.220
It's a Martingale.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.680
Well if you believe
that, then what

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.090
that says is that the
first-order autocorrelation

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.810
of monthly stock returns
should be about zero.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.960
In other words, the correlation
between last month's return

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.600
and this month's return
should be statistically

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.030
indistinguishable from zero.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.070
Because if it weren't,
if it were strictly

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.860
positive or negative, then
you'd have information

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.340
to be able to base a
trading strategy on, right?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.930
For example, if
it were positive,

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.681
then if last month's
return were positive,

00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:53.138
you can bet the
next month's return

00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:54.350
will continue to be positive.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.350
So you'll make a bigger
bet on the stock market.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.970
You'll develop a
trading strategy

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.950
that can beat the market.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.720
Efficient markets hypothesis
would say you can't do that.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.540
You can't come up with these
kind of trading strategies.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.110
In other words, stock
prices follow random walks.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.360
Autocorrelation should be 0.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.010
All right, well,
let's take a look.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.450
This is the rolling
five-year serial correlation

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.900
coefficient-- first-order
autocorrelation coefficient

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.800
for stock returns on a
monthly basis for the S&P

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:35.780
composite index from January
of 1871 to April of 2003.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.450
That's a lot of data, right?

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.385
And if these are five-year
rolling window correlations--

00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:45.890
so every five years, I'm going
to calculate the correlation

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:50.240
coefficient between month
T and month T minus 1,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.770
and it should be 0.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.180
But let's take a
look at what happens.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.850
In the 1800s, the
late 1800s, there

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:01.330
was a fair bit of positive
correlation, correlation

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.870
around 40% or 50%.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.070
And then, towards the
end of the century,

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.250
the correlation goes
down, then it goes up.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.400
Then it goes way down
in the early 1900s.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.960
Then it goes up, then it
goes down, then it goes up.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.920
During the 1970s
here, there's a bit

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.930
of a period where it goes
down, then it goes up,

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.555
then it goes down,
then it goes way up.

00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:22.560
It shoots way up in the 1990s.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.830
And then, since the 1990s,
it's been relatively low.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.590
And actually, if you extended
it to the last few years,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.170
you'd see that it's
still pretty low.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.030
This diagram shows
that market efficiency,

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.360
as measured by the first-order
autocorrelation first of all,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.620
it's not zero.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.670
But more importantly, it does
not decline monotonically

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.280
over time.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.940
Markets are not getting more
and more and more efficient.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.410
There's a cycle of efficiency.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.700
There are periods where the
market is very efficient.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.220
And there are periods
where it's not.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.990
And these periods are
determined by the population

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.560
of investors that are
interacting with each other.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.650
There are periods where markets
are extremely efficient,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.080
because you've got very
sophisticated investors

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.480
in the market.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.540
But during the 1990s,
that wasn't one of them,

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.970
because what was happening
during the 1990s?

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.140
Who was trading here?

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.770
Anybody know?

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.890
Who?

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.640
Tech.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.400
But who were the traders?

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400
AUDIENCE: Everybody was.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.191
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:33.280
Retail investors, everybody.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.190
You know, the librarian,
the pharmacist, mom and pop,

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.790
grandma, they were all
trading on E-trade on all

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.030
of these various
different trading sites.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.895
And as a result, the market
became relatively inefficient.

00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:47.770
And you can see this.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.870
You can see this
as clear as day.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.630
By the way, right
around here was

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.530
where some of the equity market
neutral hedge funds, like DE

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.020
Shaw decided to go into
business and made a lot of money

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.950
in this period.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.740
It's gotten a lot
harder now, no doubt.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.790
But my guess is that
over the next few years,

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.960
you may see markets
becoming more inefficient.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.369
Why is that?

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.339
Why might that be over
the next couple of years?

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.511
Any guesses?

00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:20.260
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.849
AUDIENCE: Because people are
pulling out of the market?

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:22.640
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.420
People, particularly
sophisticated investors,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.670
like hedge funds, are
pulling out of the market

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.050
because they're getting
blown out of the water.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.530
They're losing a lot of money.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.488
They don't have enough
to run their businesses.

00:17:32.488 --> 00:17:33.490
They're pulling out.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:39.190
And so whatever's left may not
be as efficient as it once was.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.260
That's adaptive markets.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.920
That's all.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.470
Economic systems are not
like physical systems.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.090
We're not approaching any
kind of steady state limit.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.777
We're interacting
with each other.

00:17:51.777 --> 00:17:53.360
And during certain
time periods, we're

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.400
going to be very efficient.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.050
And then, by the
way, finance there

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.080
is going to work quite well.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.360
But then there are going to
be periods that are crazy.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.810
And during those crazy
periods, market prices

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.690
may not fully reflect all
available information,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:13.300
in which case, markets will
not be as reliable as finance

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.950
theory makes them out to be.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.490
So when you apply
your 401 techniques,

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.470
you've got to start by
asking the question,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.550
do those assumptions that
we made, do they hold?

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.800
Is this a reasonable
period of time

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.164
for which finance theory will
dictate what prices should be?

00:18:31.164 --> 00:18:32.108
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:32.108 --> 00:18:34.940
AUDIENCE: If expected
return of the stock markets

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.330
let's say 10%, then the other
correlation shouldn't be zero.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.254
It should be around--

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:45.705
there's supposed to be some
correlation when the market is

00:18:45.705 --> 00:18:47.980
efficient is when the next--

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.140
ANDREW LO: No, because
remember, the correlation

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:55.080
is the covariance divided by the
variance in excess of the mean.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.360
These are deviations
from mean, right?

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.020
So it doesn't matter if
it's 10%, or 20%, or 5%.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.910
If there's a trend,
the mean basically

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.220
subtracts that trend off.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.705
Yes.

00:19:06.705 --> 00:19:10.486
AUDIENCE: There are a few
dips like, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:10.486 --> 00:19:12.385
like [INAUDIBLE] does a dip.

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:16.075
Like do you have an explanation
about like why that happened?

00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:18.430
ANDREW LO: Well,
the explanation,

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.360
at least during the recent
periods, I have one for you.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.140
I don't know about
going back here.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.970
I can conjecture.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.428
But there are a
lot of other things

00:19:26.428 --> 00:19:30.010
going on here that I can't say
that I've really researched.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.420
But over here, I can
tell you what happened,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.540
which is that the
internet bubble burst.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.140
And then retail investors,
they left the market.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.650
And who was left but
sophisticated, institutional

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.880
traders.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.970
And they took advantage
of whatever correlation

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.660
there might be.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.720
And that basically bit
away any other profits

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.280
that might have remained.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.690
So over the last, I don't know,
maybe five to eight years,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.620
long/short equity market
neutral and long/short equity

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.540
strategies, that are
the basis for taking

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.460
advantage of these
kind of correlations,

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.880
have grown dramatically.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.020
And the profits have
declined significantly.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.710
Markets have gotten
more efficient.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.160
And you know, I would argue that
during certain periods of time,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.700
for example, during the
1950s, during this period,

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.670
there were situations where
markets got more efficient

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.090
because certain institutional
investors came in,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.310
and retail investors left.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:32.172
So by looking at the population
dynamics of the market ecology,

00:20:32.172 --> 00:20:34.130
you see, I mean, that
language that I just used

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.010
is language that evolutionary
biologists would use.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.930
It's not something that
economists would ever say.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.390
How many of you actually heard
of an economist or the words

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.070
that I just uttered?

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.060
I don't think you have.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.250
You'll never hear it
in microeconomics,

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.450
because microeconomic they
treat all consumers as the same.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.570
Maximize expected utility
subject to a budget constraint.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.440
Or they treat all
producers as the same.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.090
You can maximize profits
subject to a production function

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.420
or resource constraint.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.760
What economists
don't recognize is

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.320
that there are
different populations

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.840
of consumers and producers.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.780
And these populations
arise in different ways.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.000
They're different species.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.370
And different species have
different characteristics.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.730
And so by studying
the different species,

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.860
you will come up with
different insights.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.830
But the reason that we don't
have very many insights yet

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.290
is because we don't even
speak in these terms.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.570
And therefore, we don't
measure the data in this way.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.390
For example, if I
wanted to today,

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.330
the number of retail investors
versus institutional investors

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.490
versus broker dealers
versus hedge funds--

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.160
if I want to know the biomass
of the different species,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.140
I wouldn't know where to look.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.680
There's no database that has
this information, because we're

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.550
not collecting it.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.740
We don't even collect
the information

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.470
in the way that would be the
most amenable for analysis

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.370
because this is such
a new framework.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.730
So you've got to have the
framework first to figure out

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.938
what questions you want to
ask and what data you want

00:22:02.938 --> 00:22:06.650
to collect. , And ultimately
after you do that, over time,

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.250
you'll be able to see these
kind of patterns emerging.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.805
Yeah, question.

00:22:10.805 --> 00:22:12.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
contradicts

00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:18.014
the view of market
and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:18.014 --> 00:22:20.424
of market and permits
that say [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:23.320
market the more [INAUDIBLE]
the more [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.820
ANDREW LO: Absolutely.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.100
Absolutely, it does
contradict that.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.480
Yeah, this is why I leave this
material to the last lecture,

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.410
because, you know, I feel
that it's inappropriate for me

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.530
to spend an entire course
in Introductory finance

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.500
teaching you what my pet
theories are as opposed

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.460
to the mainstream.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.440
You need to know the
basics of what's out there

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.300
and how people use the tools.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.230
So that's what we did
for 90% of the course.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.710
But I also would
feel it inappropriate

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.662
for me to perpetuate
certain myths

00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:55.120
and let you leave this class
without at least understanding

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.250
that there's a debate
going on, and that there's

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.594
some uncertainty about exactly
what theories apply when.

00:23:01.594 --> 00:23:02.260
So you're right.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.940
This does contradict
the conventional wisdom.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.440
Yeah.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.158
AUDIENCE: All right,
[INAUDIBLE] correctly,

00:23:08.158 --> 00:23:13.215
the points of [INAUDIBLE]
rational investors.

00:23:13.215 --> 00:23:14.952
So right now,
[INAUDIBLE] market.

00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:15.924
What's wrong with that?

00:23:15.924 --> 00:23:18.840
I mean, after all, we're on a
path to an ineffecient market

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.310
again, right?

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.810
ANDREW LO: There's nothing
wrong with any of this.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.570
You know, you have to keep
in mind that I'm not making

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.190
any value judgments whatsoever.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.901
What I'm trying to explain
to you is a way of thinking,

00:23:29.901 --> 00:23:30.400
right?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.130
So I'm trying to give
you a way to reconcile

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.230
the various different
kinds of market theories

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.190
that have been proposed, the
behavioral versus the rational.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.620
And what I'm arguing is that
neither of these theories

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.390
are complete.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.330
They each focus on one
aspect of the market

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.820
during one period of time.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.340
And what you need to
do in order to put it

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.660
all together is to develop
a super theory that

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.280
allows you to understand how
both of these subtheories

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.300
are integrated with each other.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.287
And I think this
is what it does.

00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:04.786
OK?

00:24:04.786 --> 00:24:11.904
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] had
said that, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:11.904 --> 00:24:15.225
show us pretty much has
a problem, because hedge

00:24:15.225 --> 00:24:18.052
funds are pretty much pulling
out as a result [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:18.052 --> 00:24:20.260
ANDREW LO: Yeah, but there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.426
Hedge funds are pulling out.

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.260
And markets will
become less efficient

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.756
over the next couple of years.

00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:28.550
AUDIENCE: I think it'll be more
efficient, because people that

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.671
have [INAUDIBLE] market, right?

00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:32.170
So--

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.753
ANDREW LO: That
depends on who's left.

00:24:33.753 --> 00:24:35.950
That depends on who's
left in the market.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.070
If it's institutional investors
and other sophisticated

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.810
investors, you may be right.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.580
But I would argue
that there are going

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.070
to be regular investors, like
you and me, that are going

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.150
to be left in the marketplace.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.941
And we're going to be
running for the hills

00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:51.220
or running for the big returns.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.440
And that's going to be
what drives the market

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.450
for the next year or two.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.150
OK?

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.400
That's going to be different
than the other periods

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.380
where you see
inefficiencies occur,

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.480
because the smart
money stayed in,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.882
and the dumb money pulled out.

00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:05.090
I shouldn't say "dumb money".

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.200
That's kind of value judgment.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.250
The naive money, the
inexperienced money,

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.440
the retail investors--

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.110
they're the ones that
pulled out, you know, here.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.220
And so here, you had
tremendous amounts

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.200
of retail money being applied.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.270
But retail investors,
they ended up

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.420
losing a fair bit of
money going forward.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.120
And what was left here
is the hedge fund money.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.820
What I'm arguing is going to
happen over the next year, what

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.770
has already happened
over the last year,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.270
is that hedge funds have pulled
out a lot of their money.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.490
So who's left?

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.170
Ask yourself, who's left?

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.030
When you think about
analyzing a market,

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.465
don't just look at it as a
mathematical object and say,

00:25:44.465 --> 00:25:45.840
I'm going to write
down the CAPM,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.549
and this is what is
going to tell me.

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:49.590
If you do that, you're
thinking like a physicist,

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.830
not like a biologist.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.370
A biologist would say,
what are the species that

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.180
are here in this ecology?

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.330
And once you tell me
that, I'll tell you

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.260
what things are going to happen
over the next year or two.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:06.050
So let me go to
now how all of this

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.874
applies to the current crisis.

00:26:08.874 --> 00:26:10.790
I'm not going to talk
about the details of it.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.020
We've already spent
a fair bit of time

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.820
this semester talking
about the crisis,

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.580
talking about subprime
mortgages, securitization,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.590
the role of all of the
various different folks

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.360
that were participating.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.540
But I want to make the following
point based upon the material

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.970
that we covered last time.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:33.050
And that is the fact
that pain protects.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.830
This is a very important,
but rather obvious

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.970
point, that I suspect many
of you may have overlooked.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.670
And let me just describe to
you a very simple illustration

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.770
of it.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.270
Have any of you
run across people

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.270
that have had like
temporary nerve damage?

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.840
You know, their arm goes
numb for whatever reason.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.394
Anybody see what
happens to that arm,

00:26:56.394 --> 00:26:58.310
you know, over the course
of a couple of weeks

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.400
after the nerve damage sets in?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.400
Anybody know?

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.560
You have seen situations
where that happens?

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.060
Yeah, Mike.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.050
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, somewhere

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.300
there was a little girl who
couldn't feel pain at all.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.531
And she had the-- she
kept clawing her eyes out.

00:27:11.531 --> 00:27:14.530
And she was completely
bruised because she just

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.760
bumped into everything.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.182
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:27:17.182 --> 00:27:17.890
It's interesting.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.050
When you see these
individuals, they

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.940
look like they've been in
a cat fight with a tiger.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.340
You know, they're scratched,
bruised, you know,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.311
they've got these
incredible wounds.

00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:31.060
And you ask them, you
know, what happened?

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.851
Did you get mugged?

00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:33.890
Did you get beaten up?

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.300
And they'll say no.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.360
It's just walking around.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:43.600
It turns out that if you
can't feel in your left arm,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.350
if it's numb, then you
won't know to pull away

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:54.460
when you scrape it on the
edge of a sharp chair,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.840
or you get pricked
by some kind of tool.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.160
You won't know to pull back.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.660
You might just keep
pushing forward.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.020
And you know, there goes
a scratch, and a cut,

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.760
and a puncture.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:12.300
If you can't feel pain,
you can't protect yourself.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.820
Pain protects.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.630
If you think about any kind
of measure you have ever taken

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.420
that has protected you,
whether it's pulling money out

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.540
of the stock market, whether
it's getting out of a burning

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.560
house, whether it's avoiding a
certain situation because you

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.740
know that it would likely
turn into a very bad accident,

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:37.440
like driving after you've
had too much to drink--

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.120
if you've ever done anything
that involves pulling back

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.660
from taking a risk,
it's because you have

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.400
felt pain, either current pain.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:55.140
Or you have felt the
memory of previous pain.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.450
Now let me ask you a question.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:02.860
Suppose none of you
are feeling any pain.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.300
Will you actually be
able to control yourself

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.330
from taking on certain risks?

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.970
So this gets back to the
crisis that we're in right now.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.720
If in 2004 or 2005,
you were at one

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.760
of these financial
institutions that

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.210
invested in these
kinds of securities

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.380
or these strategies--
and not everyone did.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.520
So I don't mean to make a
sweeping generalization.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.680
But a number of very
large institutions

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.720
seem to have
overextended themselves.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.730
What I want to argue
is that this is not

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.710
something that is very easily
preventable unless we impose

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:49.130
certain restrictions in advance,
unless we decide before we ever

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.960
enter that situation that we're
not going to do something,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.460
because otherwise it's going to
be impossible for us to avoid

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.080
doing it when it feels so
good, when we are in no pain.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.150
I want to be even more specific.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:10.970
It turns out that financial
gain, monetary reward,

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.610
actually stimulates
the same reward

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.720
circuitry that cocaine does.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.620
I'm not kidding.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.760
This is not an
analogy or a metaphor.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.430
It's a physiological fact.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.190
Neuroscientists
using fMRI machines

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.330
had individuals play games
involving real money--

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.320
not a lot of money, but enough
so that it actually registered.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:38.290
And it turns out that they found
that when people made money

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:45.550
in the MRI machine, that
their brain released dopamine

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.180
into a region of the brain
called the nucleus accumbens.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.010
This is exactly
the same thing that

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.400
happens when you take cocaine.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.160
Some people have said
that making money

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.080
is better than sex.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.840
You know what?

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.250
That's actually not
an exaggeration.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.340
It stimulates the same
kind of neural circuitry.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.930
And when you are in this
kind of a mode of reaction,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.230
when your nucleus accumbens
is being hyperstimulated

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:20.010
by dopamine, it will be very
hard, almost impossible for you

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.590
to pull back and say, no.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.030
I don't want to.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.310
That's what an
addiction is, frankly.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.220
And for extended
periods of prosperity,

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.580
which we have had over
the last 10 years,

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.530
it's become
virtually impossible.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.760
I'm not condoning it.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.700
Don't get me wrong.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.240
I'm not arguing that these
excesses are just fine

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.430
and we excuse them.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.290
I'm actually explaining
a biological fact

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.540
about how all of
us are hardwired.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.730
When we're making money, it's
very hard for us to pull back--

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:56.520
so much so, that as a
society, it is possible for us

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.640
to overextend ourselves.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:05.260
And this actually is one role
that regulation can play.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.260
You know, economists have
argued that government

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.380
should be involved because
we have public goods.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.520
We have externalities.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.027
We have incomplete markets.

00:32:13.027 --> 00:32:15.360
But I think that economists
have missed the most obvious

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.650
motivation for regulation,
which is regulation

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.310
is a means by which
society prevents itself

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.820
from doing the things that it
knows it doesn't want to do

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.090
during those periods where it
is incapable of stopping itself

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.181
from doing it.

00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:31.680
Right?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.780
This is why some people
put their potato chips

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.759
on the very top shell
in their kitchen.

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:37.800
They know that they
shouldn't be having too many.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.920
So they make it harder to get
it so that when they get it,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.010
you know, it provides
some kind of distance.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.260
And that doesn't work so well.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.510
I can attest to that.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.910
But I'll give you
another example

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.409
I'll give you another
example that's

00:32:49.409 --> 00:32:51.420
a little bit more direct.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.000
In every state in
the United States,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.640
we impose fire codes on
builders, fire codes that

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.240
require you to have a
minimum number of exits,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.350
to have well-lit exit
signs that you can see,

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.080
to have visible fire
alarms, to have sprinkler

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.220
systems in the ceiling.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.660
All of this stuff costs money.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.990
It's actually very
expensive to put it.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.480
Do you ever wonder
why we have those?

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.330
In other words, why not
let the free market work?

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.040
Let people be free to choose.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.750
Those of you that
are nervous Nellies

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.820
that are worried
about a fire, you

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.980
will simply pay
more for buildings

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.200
that have all these goodies.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.360
And then we can
have other buildings

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.730
that don't have any
of these protections.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.585
And let people be
free to choose.

00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:39.460
Why don't we do that?

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.140
That's a perfect equilibrium
from an economist

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:41.723
point of view.

00:33:41.723 --> 00:33:42.860
Well, you know why?

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.530
It's because in that
free-to-choose world,

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.239
none of you will choose the
more expensive building.

00:33:49.239 --> 00:33:50.280
And the reason is simple.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.550
It's because when you
assess the probability

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:57.360
of a fire on any given day,
you put a weight of zero

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.059
to that event.

00:33:58.059 --> 00:33:59.850
I don't any of you came
into this classroom

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.710
today thinking hmm,
if there's a fire, who

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.574
am I going to have to step
over to get out of that exit?

00:34:05.574 --> 00:34:06.990
Maybe you are
thinking about that.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.139
That's why you guys
are sitting here.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.840
But we don't think about
it, because it's not

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.690
part of our cognitive
process to focus

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.760
on every possible eventuality.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.750
We don't have an infinite
computing machine on our heads.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:27.949
So we assign certain
events zero probability.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.710
And when you do, you
will pay nothing for it.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.420
So there will be
nobody that will

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.380
pay for sprinklers, in which
case, it won't get done.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.409
And as we know, when
it doesn't get done,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.210
eventually, you have a fire.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.710
And during that fire, you really
wish you had those sprinklers.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.510
And it'll be too late to
put them in at that time.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.610
So we regulate.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.429
We regulate because
we know ourselves.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:55.010
And we know that during
certain situations,

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.430
we will not act in a way that
we would like ourselves to act.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.700
So we prevent ourselves
from doing that

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:07.770
by developing these laws that
we just simply have to follow.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:11.850
Well, that can be done
as well for problems

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.300
like leverage credit and so on.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.180
So the point is
that risk management

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.790
doesn't work unless we are able
to experience pain and fear.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:28.350
And profits are a very
potent anesthetic.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.700
They're like a drug.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.160
And the more profit you have,
for a long enough period

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.910
of time, you become a lot less
anxious about asking questions,

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.130
because you're not
feeling any pain.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.100
You're not feeling pain, so you
won't ask the tough questions.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.230
And you won't scale
back the risks

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.370
while everybody else seems
to be doing just fine.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:52.560
So the point is that
proper balance is the key.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.310
We have to have a proper
balance of fear, greed,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.320
and logical analysis.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.570
And if we know that
there are periods

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.660
where that proper balance
will be out of kilter,

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.540
that's the role that regulation
can play during those periods.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.120
OK?

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.460
So what do we what do we
think about going forward?

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:18.420
Well, clearly the
fear of the unknown

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.820
magnifies the
problems that were in.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.910
Flight to liquidity
is likely to persist.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.190
And we really are
going to have to think

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.760
more carefully about
developing better analytics.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.580
And ultimately, what
we're going to see over

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.300
the next couple of years
is a tremendous period

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.920
of innovation--

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.680
some of it good, some of it bad.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.280
But we're going to use
the current situation

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.230
to really improve and expand
the current infrastructure

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.010
for the coming decades.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:55.500
So as one of the Obama
transition managers mentioned,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.870
a crisis is a terrible
thing to waste.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.950
The next year or two is a
golden opportunity for us

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.770
to take advantage of
the crisis by motivating

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.790
ourselves to change the
regulatory infrastructure.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.360
Right?

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.820
If things are going
well, then there's

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.100
no point in trying to
change anything, right?

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.240
Don't mess with success.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.204
You've heard that before.

00:37:17.204 --> 00:37:18.620
The point is that
right now, we're

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.170
in a situation where we can
actually change something.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.150
And so the adaptive
markets would tell us

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:27.020
that this is our way of
creating that infrastructure

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.910
to build for the coming growth.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:36.660
So in conclusion, I would argue
that finance and economics are

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.000
a lot more like
evolutionary biology

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.277
than they are like physics.

00:37:41.277 --> 00:37:43.860
We really have to take a look
at the evolutionary perspective.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.880
And the bottom line
is whether or not

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.100
you are going to survive.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.920
That's what we all care about.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.750
That's what we
ultimately strive to do.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.870
And if you understand
this about markets,

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.570
you'll have a much better
chance of surviving.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.090
So from the perspective
of 401, the material

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.160
we've learned in
this course, we've

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.240
gone over the rational
approach to analyzing value

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.140
in various kinds of
market interactions.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.080
And just be aware that
for the most part,

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.030
that may work reasonably well.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:22.350
But for extreme circumstances,
periods of extreme wealth,

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.750
as well as periods of
extreme market distress,

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:31.790
prices may not be in-line with
what our analytical framework

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.360
suggests.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.970
And at that point, you
need to reassess and try

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.990
to come up with alternatives.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.280
What those are, we
currently don't know.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.620
We don't have a
good theory for what

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.920
happens when the traditional
analytics break down,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.960
because up until
recently, nobody

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.490
would be even
willing to consider

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.141
that the traditional analytics
would ever break down.

00:38:52.141 --> 00:38:52.640
OK?

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.560
So this whole area
is relatively new.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.350
And as I mentioned, at the
beginning of this lecture,

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.341
if you do a search
for adaptive markets,

00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:02.090
you're going to only
find my name attached

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.050
to that at this point.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.710
It's not really a theory that's
come into even common parlance,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.960
never mind general acceptance.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.540
It's a conjecture at this point.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:14.850
It's an alternative to the
current received wisdom.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:18.200
But the hope is that over time,
as we understand more and more

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.080
about these interactions, we'll
be able to develop alternative.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.900
So then, I'm hoping that
a few years from now,

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.610
I will be able to
tell all of you,

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.910
this is a theory for markets
when they are normal.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.150
And this is a theory for
markets under certain kinds

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.500
of distress.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.250
And at that point, we will have
a complete theory of markets

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.480
under all circumstances.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.388
But we're still a few
years away from that.

00:39:40.388 --> 00:39:41.264
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:41.264 --> 00:39:44.445
AUDIENCE: There are a number
of economists the value

00:39:44.445 --> 00:39:47.330
that the financial
sector in the US

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.920
was already among the
most regulated sectors.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.295
But partially these regulations
caused [INAUDIBLE] Fannie Mae

00:39:55.295 --> 00:39:56.740
and Freddie Mac.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.738
And so actually, I would
argue for the opposite.

00:40:00.738 --> 00:40:02.530
And do you think
that the regulation

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.845
should be fixed because it's
wrong, or you should add more?

00:40:07.845 --> 00:40:10.820
ANDREW LO: Well, I don't
think we should add more.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.710
I would argue that we
don't need more regulation.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.500
We need better
regulation, smarter,

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.770
more adaptive regulation.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.500
So to your point,
the banking sector,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:28.120
which is where the majority
of these problems sit today,

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.000
the banking sector is
the most regulated sector

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.390
of all in all of
the financial world.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:39.730
And the next most regulated
sector is the insurance sector.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.870
And you have
problems there, too.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.680
So on the one hand, you
could argue that gee,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.170
it's all this regulation
that's created it.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.000
I don't believe that either.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.760
And the reason is that
a lot of these problems

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.790
started in 1999 and
after when we actually

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.340
dismantled some
of the regulation,

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.470
in particular the
Glass-Steagall Act.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.240
We dismantled that in 1999.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.910
And by the way, that wasn't
done by the Republicans.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.110
Bill Clinton signed that.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.670
So there's blame to share
across both political parties.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.510
This is not a political
problem, per say.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.310
So we reduced regulation.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.320
We allowed banks to be
more like hedge funds.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.200
We allowed hedge funds
to be more like banks.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.640
And we got ourselves into the
problem that we face today.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.200
So it's not more regulation.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.260
We have to be smarter about
what we're regulating.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.630
And that's what I'm
hoping that we will

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:37.170
do over the next few years.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:40.220
OK, well, that's it.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.000
That's it for
Introductory Finance.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.600
What I want to do now in just
the last 15 or 20 minutes,

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.944
I'm going to give you a
near-death experience,

00:41:50.944 --> 00:41:52.610
because you get to
see the entire course

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.620
flash before your very eyes.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:58.340
I want to go over what
we've done to-date

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.732
and try to make sense of it all.

00:41:59.732 --> 00:42:01.190
And then I'll tell
you a little bit

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:07.030
about what you might be in store
for with classes in the future.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:11.570
So let's start at
the very beginning.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.470
I started with this motivation--
mathematics plus money

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.400
is equal to finance.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.160
And I hope that I've
delivered on that.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.310
In other words, we've got
very different approaches

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.510
to investments.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.940
At the one in the
spectrum, James Simons,

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.060
at the other, Warren
Buffett, and, of course,

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.430
Jack Welch in-between.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:35.090
And each of these individuals
brings unique skills

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.550
and insights into the
investment process.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.810
And what we wanted
to do in this course,

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:43.280
was to try to distill some
of the basic principles

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.820
and the language of finance that
all three of these individuals

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.740
would agree are
sort of the building

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.070
blocks of understanding
market dynamics.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.650
And as we started
at the beginning

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.840
with this flow model
of the economy,

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.240
we said that we were going
to study four components--

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.420
households, capital markets,
financial intermediaries,

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.740
and non-financial corporations.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.560
That's the financial
system as we know it.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.570
And we began with those six
principles of modern finance.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.922
Now I think you have a
deeper appreciation for it.

00:43:13.922 --> 00:43:15.380
As I said, we were
only going to be

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.260
able to focus on the first few.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.450
And the latter
principles were going

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.700
to be underlying
much of the theories

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.957
that you would study
beyond this course.

00:43:24.957 --> 00:43:26.540
There's no such thing
as a free lunch.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.450
That's a very basic principle
that we used time and again

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.650
in coming up with various
different pricing implications.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.010
And P2 is the
behavioral assumption

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.100
that I argued we need
for much of the theories

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.280
that we developed.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.370
But what I just told
you in the last lecture

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.830
is that there are
occasions where

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.800
those behavioral
assumptions, ultimately,

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.470
are suspended or
replaced with this kind

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.110
of overwhelming
emotional component.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.790
We prefer more money
to less, prefer

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:59.260
money now to money later,
and we prefer to avoid risk.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.570
P3-- all agents act to further
their own self-interest.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.970
That's pretty straightforward.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.080
P4-- financial
market prices shift

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.510
to equate supply and demand.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.792
And then P5-- financial markets
highly adaptive-competitive,

00:44:11.792 --> 00:44:13.250
and that risk-sharing
and frictions

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.620
are central to
financial innovation.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.540
I hope that throughout
the entire course

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.930
you've got an appreciation for
all six of these principles.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.160
It's remarkable how such
relatively simple ideas

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.130
can have such dramatic
implications as we've developed

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:30.690
over the last 13 weeks.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:33.280
OK so there are four
sections that we focused

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.070
on-- the introduction,
evaluation, risk,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.420
and corporate finance.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.780
And then the final lecture of
"Try to put it all together."

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.170
For present value,
the focus really

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.530
was defining what an asset is--
a package, a sequence of cash

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.620
flows, and the time
value of money,

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.530
looking at present value
versus future value,

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:57.830
and focusing on exchange
rates between today, tomorrow,

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:58.600
and other dates.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.610
That was sort of
the key insight.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:04.900
And once you understand how
to visualize the cash flows

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:09.670
and move money through time, you
understand a very significant

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.421
portion of financial analysis.

00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:14.170
And then we talked
about some special cash

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.000
flows-- perpetuities
and annuities,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.190
which we use for virtually
everything in terms

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.910
of valuation.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.830
Very important ideas.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.310
And then we talked a bit about
compounding and inflation.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.200
Fixed-income
securities-- Well, we

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.080
talked about applying the
very basic mathematics

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:33.520
of present value to these
pure discount bonds and coupon

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.625
bonds.

00:45:34.625 --> 00:45:37.000
The relationship between coupon
bonds and discount bonds,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.150
of course, is through arbitrage.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.940
And we also found that
current bond prices

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.190
contain enormous
amounts of information

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.900
about what's going to
happen in the future.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.650
We talked about spot
rates, forward rates,

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.480
yield-to-maturity yield
curve, interest rate, risk.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.600
And then we focused
on corporate bonds.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.340
And I spent some time
giving the example

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.670
of how repackaging
corporate bonds, and things

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:03.610
like mortgages, auto loans,
and other securities,

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.980
could actually lead
to some very, very

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:11.200
attractive securities for a
variety of different clientele.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.800
For equity securities, we
applied exact same framework

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.370
to try to come up with a
value of a future stream

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:19.480
of dividends.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.930
And here, while the
mathematics was pretty similar,

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.210
the interpretation differed
in an important way,

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.420
because dividends are random,
whereas, in the case of bond

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.110
prices, the coupons
are known in advance.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.730
So that's the difference between
fixed-income securities, where

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.560
the incomes are
fixed in advance,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.590
versus equity securities,
where there's randomness.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.600
What that randomness
does is to make

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.850
the volatility of these
pricing models much greater.

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.790
In other words, it's
harder to pin down

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.980
what the price of
an equity security

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.380
is, because in addition
to all of the risks

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.839
that a bond will face--

00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:57.130
in other words, the risk of
future changes and interest

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:57.880
rates--

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.240
you get the risks of changes
in dividends, earnings,

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.290
cash flows, and so on.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.160
We also talked about
valuing companies

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.250
using various different
formulas, and then the idea

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.640
behind PVGO, the present
value of growth opportunities,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.850
and how that can actually lead
to some tremendous valuation

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:21.300
swings in a company that's based
upon intellectual property.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.705
We then talked about a whole
other set of securities

00:47:23.705 --> 00:47:25.830
that most of you probably
haven't come into contact

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.270
with-- futures versus forwards.

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:32.330
These are weird securities
in the sense that they're

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:37.100
worth nothing on the day
that you agree to enter

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.961
into one of these contracts.

00:47:38.961 --> 00:47:40.460
But the reason
they're worth nothing

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.430
is that these are bilateral
agreements between two

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.770
counterparties
And so both of you

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:50.360
are willing to enter into this
in a willing exchange of cash

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.522
flow payments sometime
in the future.

00:47:52.522 --> 00:47:54.230
The only reason you're
willing to do that

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:57.950
is because the contract
from an objective standpoint

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:00.470
doesn't have any NPV.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.410
And we see that the marking
to market of futures

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.600
makes a very big
difference in terms

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.480
of the liquidity characteristics
of that contract.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.540
We see that today with what's
going on in financial markets--

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.510
and that using these contracts
both for hedging purposes

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.960
and for speculation
is a very key aspect

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.430
of this whole industry.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.710
Question?

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:23.210
Zeke?

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.350
Oh, okay.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.800
Then the last set of
securities that we spent time

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.600
on in this course, is options.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.420
Options are different
from anything else

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.250
we've looked at up
until now, because first

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:40.170
of all, their payoffs are
asymmetric; they're kinked.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.420
And by putting together
a portfolio of options,

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.340
we can get all sorts
of weird payoffs.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.820
In fact in the
various different exam

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.680
questions that
you might get, you

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.750
will be asked to try to come up
with different kinds of payoff

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:54.660
structures.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.700
So you need to know a
little bit about how

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.440
to put these things
together and what

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.840
the various different
payoffs imply

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.700
under different circumstances.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.390
We also gave you a very simple
example of an option pricing

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:10.200
strategy, a model, namely,
the binomial pricing model.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.960
Very simple, but it's actually
one of the most heavily used

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.430
in industry.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:18.840
And it's an extraordinarily
flexible and powerful method,

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:24.060
again, based on the principle
of arbitrage, or no free lunch.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:28.590
We then started introducing risk
into the picture explicitly.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.980
We talked about the size effect,
January effect, value line,

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.780
momentum, accruals, and pointed
out that all of these effects

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.140
can lead to certain
investment strategies.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.300
Whether or not the
strategies are good or bad

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.640
really requires a framework.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.722
We didn't have a
framework at the time.

00:49:45.722 --> 00:49:47.430
But I wanted to point
out these anomalies

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.160
to just mention that
they are the basis

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.500
for a number of investment
products and ideas

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.610
over the years.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.880
And so we really need to have
a systematic way of thinking

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.730
about how to evaluate not
only these strategies,

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.410
but the managers that tout them.

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.090
Are they adding value?

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:06.120
Or is this something that really
you could do for yourself?

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.200
So we developed this notion
of not so much picking

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.890
a stock, or a good
two or three stocks,

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.890
but putting together a
whole collection of stocks,

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.850
a good portfolio.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:23.490
And we zeroed in on mean and
variance as the key concepts

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.000
to evaluate what is good
and what is not good.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.180
And we deduced the main
result of finance theory

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.600
under uncertainty, which is
the capital asset pricing

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.850
model in two forms--

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.090
the capital market line
for efficient portfolios,

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:46.230
and the security market line
for any kind of security

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.360
or portfolio, whether
it's efficient or not.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.980
And this allows us to
resolve the open question

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.050
that we started with,
which is, how do we

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.590
determine what the appropriate
risk-adjusted discount rate is?

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.260
I've said at the very beginning,
let the market determine it.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.840
This allows us to
explicate how it

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.210
is that the market might
go about doing so, assuming

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.220
rationality.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.730
If people aren't rational,
this goes out the window.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.790
But assuming that they are,
this is a complete theory

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.910
for how you determine
risk and expected return.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:24.190
And using risk an
expected return,

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.510
we now have a complete
theory for capital budgeting,

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:31.140
for how to evaluate whether or
not you ought to take a project

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.840
or not take a project, OK?

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.870
And last and
certainly not least,

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.080
we talked about the idea behind
market efficiency, the idea

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.630
that you can actually trust
market prices, market rates

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:47.340
of return, market betas, all
of the information that you

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.180
glean from market data and
apply them to your decisions.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.960
Can you trust them?

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.170
And the answer is sometimes.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.330
When markets are efficient,
when prices fully

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.580
reflect all available
information,

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.340
the power and the
wisdom of crowds

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.930
is very, very compelling.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:07.560
But there are periods
where the crowd is not

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.260
a wise crowd, but an
angry mob, like right now.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.710
So you want to be careful
and not talk to the market

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:16.230
about evaluating your
project when they're

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:19.020
trying to lynch somebody or some
financial institution that's

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.120
out there, OK?

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.180
And in order to reconcile
efficient markets

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.260
with these periods
of insanity, I

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.540
proposed this notion
of adaptive markets.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.020
And at least it provides
a consistent framework

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.860
for thinking about these
periods of craziness,

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.670
as well as periods
of market calm.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:42.960
So that's it.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.210
That's it for 15.401.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:47.640
Where you go from
here depends upon what

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.710
your career objectives are.

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:54.170
If you're interested in
pursuing investments,

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.970
if you want to be a trader,
a portfolio manager,

00:52:56.970 --> 00:53:01.920
or get involved in pension asset
management, what you want to do

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.710
is to focus on the
investments direction, things

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:10.560
like 15.433 Investments, or
15.437 Options and Futures.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.400
And we have a number of
practical pro seminars

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.900
that are taught
by practitioners,

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.840
like Seth Alexander, the
current Chief Investment

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.530
officer of the MIT Endowment,
or Phil Cooper, former partner

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.170
of Goldman Sachs who has his
own private equity company.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.080
There are a number of
these practitioner courses,

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.570
as well as the
theoretical courses

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.450
that we offer that I would
encourage you to take.

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.730
If, on the other
hand, you're looking

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:40.890
for something on the
corporate financial side--

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:45.570
project finance, corporate
financial management,

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.540
that kind of approach
requires that you learn more

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.340
about capital budgeting,
mergers and acquisitions,

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.930
corporate finance, so
15.434 is a good course,

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.730
and certain accounting courses.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.220
You might want to take
financial accounting.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.630
Those are the
directions that you

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.060
may want to take if you're
interested in pursuing

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.160
that career path,

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.850
So both of them I think are
extraordinarily exciting.

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.040
They all rely on the
material that we've

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.540
covered in this course.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.530
And so, you know, you
now have the background

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.270
to be able to handle any
and all of that material.

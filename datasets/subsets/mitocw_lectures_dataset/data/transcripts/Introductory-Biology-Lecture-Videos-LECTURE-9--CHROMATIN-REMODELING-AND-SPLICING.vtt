WEBVTT

00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:18.030
BARBARA IMPERIALI: So what
we're going to do today

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.030
is we're going to finish
up a bit of transcription,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.650
and then I'm going
to talk largely

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.240
about transcription control.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.750
Because it's tremendously
important that we actually

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.270
not just know how to
transcribe, but we

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.900
know how it's controlled,
and how ultimately

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.060
the appropriate messenger RNA
is sent out for a translation

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.910
into proteins.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.620
So transcription control is
a very important component.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.230
So let me just start
with this first.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.890
So these are typical
of questions.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.560
And they look like, gosh, I
don't have enough information

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.210
to answer this question.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
And it's basically about what's
known as the transcription

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.940
bubble, which is the portion of
the double-stranded DNA, where

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.080
transcription is occurring.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.190
And so a transiently,
the double-stranded DNA

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.540
is opened up for the
RNA polymerase, which

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.930
remember has inbuilt
helicase activity to start

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.920
transcribing the gene.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.880
So let's just say we have
the information we might give

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.150
you is that
transcription starts here

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.450
at this point on the
double-stranded DNA.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.050
And what we want you
to know is that you

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.110
have all the information you
need to know which of the two

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.930
strands is copied.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.680
Have you had a chance
to think about that?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.920
Does anyone want to give
me a good answer to that?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.030
Yes, here.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.530
AUDIENCE: The
bottom [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.988
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
And why is that?

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:46.688
AUDIENCE: Because
it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:47.730
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Right.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.000
So that reading things
3 prime to 5 prime,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.420
and making things
5 prime to 3 prime,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.000
is all you need to know
to answer this question.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.090
So you would
straightaway know, OK,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.730
we're going to start
somewhere here,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.770
but we're actually
going to start

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.900
on the lower strand,
because that's the one 3

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.250
prime to 5 prime.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.870
And we're going to
make the new transcript

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.050
in the appropriate direction,
and know what it's going to be.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.040
So you can only read the
bottom strand in this case.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.200
But watch out,
because you might be

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.160
reading the top strand in the
appropriate direction as well.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.570
But what we've told you already
is where the start site is.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.640
So you're going to
know that information.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.910
If we'd put, for example, that
the start site was over here,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.910
you might have different
answers to this question.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.230
So the only singular piece
of information you need

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.770
is that you read 3 to
5, and you make 5 to 3.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.980
Then you can also
fill in the bases

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.760
to know what the transcribed
sequence looks like.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.370
And I always recommend when
you're filling in bases,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.770
you just write 5
prime to 3 prime.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.580
So you really are following
properly which is being read,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.620
and the direction
it's being read.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.910
And so if you were asked what
the new messenger RNA sequence

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.700
would be, you'd get it right.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.870
And here I just
have a few questions

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.020
that will help highlight
the differences

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.980
between the transcription
process and the replication

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.880
process.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.310
So can you guys just
read each of these,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.410
and see whether
they look like rules

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.780
that apply to
transcription, or they're

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.640
things that are not true
about transcription.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.980
So just give you one second
to think about that, who?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.100
OK, who would like
to give me an answer?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.950
Someone over in this
part of the room,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.981
I haven't heard as much-- yes?

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.462
AUDIENCE: Makes a complete
copy of one strata.

00:03:46.462 --> 00:03:47.420
BARBARA IMPERIALI: DNA.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.620
OK, so the correct answer
is that we only transcribe

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.670
about 1.5% of the genomic DNA.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.040
We're not transcribing
the whole thing.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.220
We're only transcribing the bits
that we need to make proteins.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.260
So the correct answer
is C, because we

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.650
don't make a copy of the
whole of genomic DNA.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.650
But these are all right.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.560
We have a different
set of nucleotides,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.950
or rather a difference in one
of the nucleotide triphosphate

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.140
building blocks.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.890
Remember that RNA polymerase
does not require a primer.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.860
That was a complication when
we looked at replication,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.740
because we had to paste
in primers, made often

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.390
by the primase, RNA primase.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.410
All RNA polymerase is much
cleverer than DNA polymerase,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.900
because it has the
polymerase activity.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.240
It has the helicase activity.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.880
There isn't needed
a topoisomerase,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.980
because we're only
opening a little bit

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.690
of the double-stranded to copy.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.720
I'll show you a
movie in a second.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.380
And it also has a 3
prime exonuclease,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.460
which means that RNA is able to
do its own proofreading, just

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.990
like the DNA polymerase.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.180
So the error rate is
similar to the error

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.430
rate with the
exonuclease activity for.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.683
DNA so that's about 1 in 10
to the 5 to 10 to the sixth.

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.100
Now I'm going to
talk in a minute.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.360
There's not the same
cadre of repair enzymes

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.250
that we have for DNA.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.560
And that's a curious thing,
until you start thinking

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.730
about what the reality is.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.400
So let me try to lead
you to my thinking.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.060
So with genomic
DNA, that's the copy

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.630
of the DNA that's in the
nucleus that has to stay good.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.630
So if there's any mistakes,
we need them cleaned up.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.840
Because otherwise
when we replicate

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.180
a set of all of the
double-stranded DNA,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.070
there will be an error in the
progeny, the daughter cells.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.030
For transcribing RNA,
an error rate of about 1

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.790
in 10 to the 5 to 1 in
10 to a 6, is just fine.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.740
That piece of RNA ends up,
after a few of the processing

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.430
steps that I'll describe to
you, ends up leaving the nucleus

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.710
to be made into proteins.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.890
And it's not such a bad thing
if you have a little bit

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.990
more error in that RNA.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.960
Why is that?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.940
Over here, or up there actually.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.580
Yeah?

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.822
AUDIENCE: It has a
shorter life, so it's not

00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:30.652
going to mess up everything
for the rest of its life.

00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:33.110
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Right, so
if you have a bit of an error,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.980
maybe you make a new protein,
but it's not full length,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.790
or the protein you make
isn't perfect; it's OK.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.820
Because there'll be other
transcripts that are correct,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.160
and then after you've
done making the protein,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.430
then you're just
going to destroy

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.910
that RNA, because it has a
transient lifetime because

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.850
of the structure of the
RNA, and the nucleases that

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.270
chew up the RNA.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.760
So this is an acceptable
error rate for RNA polymerase.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.280
Remember, it's not an
acceptable error rate

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.660
to have in your genome.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.280
OK, it's just too big.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.330
Any questions about that?

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.060
Does that all make sense?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.560
OK.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.620
All right, so now
we want to talk

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.030
about transcription control.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.870
But before I do that, I do
want to very quickly show you

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.160
something, because I feel
like it really caps off

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.140
the transcription part.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.820
And I'm going to
show you only about

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.513
a minute of this,
because once again, I

00:07:33.513 --> 00:07:34.680
love the sound effects here.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.540
And I can't turn
down the volume.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.340
This is one of those animations
showing transcription.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.960
And it basically shows on
the double-stranded DNA,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.010
lot of things accumulating to
make a decision with respect

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.330
to starting.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.560
But now, the whole
complex, the RNA polymerase

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.750
is just screeching through the
DNA, making that messenger RNA.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.220
And you're only unraveling
just a little bit of DNA

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.970
around that
transcription bubble.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.560
So you wouldn't need
topoisomerase in this case.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.700
You're only copying
one of the two strands.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.170
We saw how to identify which.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.500
And thus, the new RNA
strand is basically

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.210
falling out of the complex.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.084
You can see [INAUDIBLE]
it's moving a lot.

00:08:24.084 --> 00:08:26.479
So that gives you
a feel for things.

00:08:30.293 --> 00:08:31.960
When I hear that
music, I'm just sort of

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.940
waiting for the whole
thing to crash somewhere.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.039
But who would know, right?

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.590
All right.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.890
So at the beginning
of that animation

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.929
a few things were
highlighted, where

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.620
there's the double-stranded DNA,
and a collection of entities

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.440
starts clustering around
where the reading is

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.980
going to take place.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.080
So this thin, black strand
is the double-stranded DNA.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.800
So some of the entities
accumulate quite close

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.270
to the start site.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.180
There is a section of
DNA known as a TATA box

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.020
that we spoke about, at the
very end of the last lecture.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.080
But there are a number
of transcription factors

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.790
that are quite important.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.010
But then you might also,
if you go back and look

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.580
at that animation, there
are sections of DNA

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.010
that are at quite a distance
that also help really regulate

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.060
and promote transcription.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.320
So many factors regulate where
the transcription occurs.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.080
First of all, is there
a promoter site right

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.340
near where we need to start?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.790
That causes a fair
amount of collecting

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.040
of complex components.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.800
But then there may be
other things at a distance.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.860
So the promoter region
might be located quite

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.380
near the transcription
start site,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.690
but then there
are also enhancers

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.360
that can be located at
quite a big distance

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.500
away from the start site
that also play a role.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.780
Why do we need
this much control?

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.940
Because we don't
need to be making

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.960
the RNA for every protein
all at the same time.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.360
Certain times in cell
cycle you'll see,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.720
I only need to make one
protein or a different protein.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.430
So we need all of this control
to decide when transcription

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.850
occurs, when do we need
to make the messenger

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.220
RNA to make our favorite new
protein that needs to be made.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.740
And you'll learn a lot in
signal transduction and cell

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.410
cycle, where we
really show you how

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.870
a lot of the housekeeping
genes are all fine.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.035
The proteins are all there.

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:34.660
But at a certain
stage, we need to make

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.670
more of a particular protein.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.250
And that's when the
transcription control

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.020
comes into play.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.850
And you'll commonly
hear about things

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.125
called transcription factors.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.440
And those may be the
proteins, for example,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.410
that regulate that
transcription should start.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.930
In other cases, there
may be times when

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.750
transcription is turned down.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.790
So we have things that activate.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.440
So we start transcription,
we make that happen,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.640
or others that repress.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.950
So they turn down transcription.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.750
So it's all about when
you need to start,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.480
which is controlled
by external factors

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.460
acting on the
double-stranded DNA

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.360
to send the transcription
complex, making the new entity.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.830
All right, does that make sense?

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.520
We can't have a dysregulated
system, or if we do,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.520
then we have problems
with, for example,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.190
proliferation of cells.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.170
All right, so what
I want to talk about

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.590
are the key things that
regulate transcription,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.790
and the key things that we do to
the messenger that's been made.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.770
So what you're seeing
here on this slide

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.350
is just where we
are in the process.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.730
We've seen replication.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.650
We're now at the
transcription step.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.210
But there are many steps
to go in eukaryotes

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.150
before that transcript
can leave the nucleus.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.280
All right?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.130
And I want you to
remember the difference

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.400
between eukaryotic
and prokaryotic cells.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.190
This was just a picture
we saw very early on.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.920
Prokaryotic cells,
like bacteria,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.610
do not have a nucleus.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.000
They have an area
called a nucleoid,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.040
but they don't have a discrete
membrane encased organelle,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.030
where the processes of
replication and transcription

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.930
occur.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.450
In contrast, in
eukaryotes, there

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.780
is a discrete area of
the cell, the nucleus,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.140
that includes all the
machinery for replication

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.850
and transcription.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.100
And it also includes
the machinery

00:12:50.100 --> 00:13:03.620
that takes a pre-messenger
RNA into a mature messenger

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.840
RNA that can leave the nucleus.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.820
If you send that
pre-messenger out there,

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.820
it's going to have a lot
of stuff wrong with it.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.700
It's not going to
be ready to face

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.350
the outside of the nucleus.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.310
It's going to be
readily degraded.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.260
It's not going to have
the full information.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.190
So I want to talk to you
about the processes that

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.470
are put in place
for this conversion

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.850
from the pre-messenger RNA
to the messenger RNA, which

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.730
we don't have to think
about in prokaryotes,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:41.750
the small organisms
without organelles.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.770
All right, so, and
this is the foundation

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.215
of transcriptional control.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.956
All right.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:05.380
So, we've talked about
promoters and enhancers.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.520
Those happen early.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.230
That's all about making
the pre-messenger RNA.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.130
But now we have to discuss
some aspects that are also

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:24.100
critical for making the initial
pre-messenger RNA, and that's

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:34.770
chromatin remodelers,
or chromatin remodeling.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.520
Because in order to
transcribe anything,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.020
there's a lot of ground to
cover with respect to unwrapping

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.060
the chromatin, the chromosomes.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.200
Because they're all
packed up in such a way

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.490
that you can't possibly do
any transcription there,

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.890
because they're too
tightly packed in order

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.890
to be accessible for the
transcription machinery

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.030
to tackle it.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.700
So I show you parts of
that machinery up here.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.300
These are the nucleosomes
that make up chromatin,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.340
which makes up the chromosomes.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.210
And in order for you to even
be able to start transcribing,

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.970
you have to unravel that part,
those complex structures that

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.290
are tightly wrapped up.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.010
You've got make the
double-stranded DNA accessible,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.930
otherwise you can't
break into it.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.770
So there are two things
that also contribute

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:32.730
to allowing transcription, and
those occur both at the DNA

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.400
level, and the histone level.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.020
And I'm going to talk about the
histone level changes first.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.300
I want you to recall that
histones are proteins that

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.310
have a lot of positive charge,
by virtue of the fact that they

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:56.580
include two of the positively
charged amino acids, arginine

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.690
and lysine.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.640
And if you're curious
about those structures,

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.910
you can go look back at the
table of the amino acids

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.150
and see that those guys are
always positively charged.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:11.040
The reason we use histones as
the core of the nucleus home

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.790
structure, is they're
very positively charged,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.740
and they neutralize the
dense negative charge

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.910
of the nucleic acid.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.120
Otherwise we couldn't pack
it up as tightly as we do.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.330
So changes that occur
at the histone level,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.660
and their remodeling
of the chromatin

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.300
in order to promote
transcription

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:39.850
is modification oftentimes
to neutralize those charges.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.970
So the one most obvious one
I'll show you, and then there

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.660
are others where you
add methyl groups that

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.830
dampen down the charge.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.740
But I'm just going to show
you the very obvious one.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:59.140
So let's just look at
lysine in a protein.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.730
That looks like this.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.069
That is a terrible drawing.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.319
It has a positive
charge for bonds

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.109
to nitrogen. In order to
neutralize that charge,

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.310
there are enzymes that
acylate, or transfer

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.359
an acyl group to turn this
positively charged amine

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.640
into a neutral amide.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.500
Let me draw that side
chain, because I think

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.619
it makes much more
sense to understand it,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.560
this particular thing from
a chemical perspective.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.230
So we still have the n but
it is now part of an amide.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.990
So the charge has been
neutralized on the nitrogen.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.520
If the charge is neutralized on
the positively charged residues

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.790
in the histones, the
DNA will be encouraged

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.070
to unravel from those.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.010
It makes good chemical
sense that that's a good way

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.920
to start on packaging DNA.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.220
The other modification
occurs at the DNA level

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:09.560
and it's methylation
of cytosine.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.910
A little harder to explain
from a chemical sense,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.580
but up there in the
corner of this slide

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.830
I've shown you the pictures.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:24.700
So methylation on cytosine
would look like this.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.850
This encourages stabilization
of the chromatin.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.620
So what would that do
to transcription if I've

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.960
stabilized the chromatin?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.910
It represses it.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.530
It turns it down.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.900
So these are pairs of changes
that act in opposite direction.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:57.410
So we'd go down-regulate
transcription.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.840
OK, so DNA methylation
causes the chromatin

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.750
to be a bit more
compact, more stable.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.750
It's much harder
to unravel the DNA.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.410
It's obviously then harder
to start transcription.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.970
In contrast, modification
of the histone proteins

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:24.490
to neutralize their charges
destabilizes and up-regulates

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.040
transcription,
because it's allowing

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.250
us to open up the
nucleosomes in order

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.448
to make the DNA available.

00:19:32.448 --> 00:19:33.490
Does that all make sense?

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:39.060
So we have two counter-balances
that play in each direction.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.560
OK?

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.816
All right, so that's
chromatic remodeling.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.720
The next two transformations
I'll show you

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.550
may certainly look
fairly complicated.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.730
But I'm going to
describe them to you,

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.920
and show you what
the changes are,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.180
and how they would contribute
to stabilizing the transcript

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.610
and finishing the
transcript up, to make

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.580
it ready to leave the
nucleus, to go out

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.160
to the cytoplasm, where the
machinery to translate proteins

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.660
is.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.410
Because you want to
remember the ribosomes

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.060
that we're going to use on
Friday aren't in the nucleus.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.790
They're in the cytoplasm.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.540
So there is a variety of events.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.655
There is what's known
as 5 prime capping.

00:20:35.858 --> 00:20:39.500
So that is going to be a change.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:46.510
Let's just say this goes down.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.000
This is the base.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.600
Remember 1, 2, 3 prime,
4 prime, 5 prime.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.340
It's something that's happening
to this end of the messenger

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.600
RNA that stabilizes it.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.810
So 5 prime capping is
important for one end.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:15.830
And then at the other end
there is polyadenylation

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.900
of the 3 prime end.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.810
OK, so let's just look
at these one at a time.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.770
And let me convince
you that they

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.700
are important changes in the
transcript that will preserve

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.250
its identity, and in fact,
give it a little bit more

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.300
information.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.810
Because indeed, the 5 prime
capping modification actually

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:38.730
is a signal later on, when the
transcript leaves the nucleus

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.470
for protein translation.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.900
But in general, both
of these changes

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.060
mechanically protect the
ends of the part of the gene

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.460
that you're going to
want to translate.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.560
They basically leave
that piece of gene

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.170
in the middle, where it's
not going to be nibbled up,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.880
it's not going to be degraded.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.520
Because the biggest
threat to the messenger

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.638
RNA are things known
as exonucleases.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.840
Exonucleases chew down nucleic
acids from the two ends.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.680
All right.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.690
So let's look
first, and it's kind

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.025
of wild and crazy chemistry,
at the 5 prime capping.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.730
And then we'll
discuss the other two.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.300
And then I will finish
these types of changes

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.780
with splicing, which is really
cool and extremely important.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.690
But the transcript,
the pre-messenger RNA

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.970
has to go through
all of these steps

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.670
before it's ready
for nuclear export.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.490
So in 5 prime capping,
you have this strand

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.350
of pre-messenger RNA.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.700
Everything looks pretty happy.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.240
It's all in one piece.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.560
But the first thing that
happens is three phosphates

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.710
are added to that
5 prime OH group.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.080
So that's the start
of this process.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.290
And this process
actually happens

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.160
while you're still transcribing
the double-stranded DNA.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.510
It's actually already going on.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.230
As soon as that component
of the newly transcribed

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.600
pre-messenger RNA
is made, things

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.250
start happening at the 5
prime end to protect it.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.100
At that stage, then once
those three phosphates

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.020
are put on there, and
nucleobase is added backwards.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.700
So there's a couple
of functions.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.770
This all looks pretty strange.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.840
The rest of this still
looks quite good.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.880
It looks fairly intact.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.170
But then the next
thing that happens

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.580
is that the guanine
that's here is--

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.520
you do not have to remember this
stuff, I couldn't remember it.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.700
I just want to show you
how weird and different

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.080
the 5 prime end looks.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.640
It doesn't look like
a strand of RNA.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.210
So the guanine is methylated.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.270
And then a couple
of the riboses,

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.270
those sugars that have
an OH usually at 2 prime,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.560
get methylated.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.610
So we've created this entire
thing at the 5 prime end,

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.060
known as the 5 prime
cap that looks nothing

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.650
like regular messenger RNA.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.760
And that protects that
end of the messenger,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.040
and makes it safe from
a variety of insults.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.920
So let's take a look.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.370
Why does it happen?

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.150
So the first thing is it
stops nuclease activity.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.500
Because the nuclease
could look at it, and go,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.620
I don't recognize any
of this happy mess.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.320
I'm not going to chop
down this component.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.940
It's too foreign to me.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.980
So that's the primary thing.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.310
But then it's actually quite
important for regulation

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.170
of when that messenger
needs to leave the nucleus.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.130
There are proteins
involved in helping export

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.860
the messenger RNA, when
it's ready from the nucleus.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.990
So it's an important signal
or recognition element.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.680
It marks this thing
as a messenger RNA

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.170
that's going to be
important in translation.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.180
It gives it an identity.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.180
And then finally, it can
actually in the next step

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.860
promote translation.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.780
So all of these
things are useful.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.230
So we do a number of these
unusual transformations,

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.420
but they all have a
reason, and they all

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.960
carried out in the
nucleus purposed

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.830
to protect the 5 prime
cap of the messenger,

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.860
and actually make it
ready for its next tasks.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.030
All right?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.150
The next thing that
happens is what's

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.260
known as polyadenylation.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.120
So here's it.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.220
This would be the 5 prime cap.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.410
In the middle would be
your gene that you're

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.880
going to transcribe.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.450
But at the other end there is
an enzyme that puts on a lot

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:41.190
of adenine nucleotides, and
basically adds to the other end

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.985
a lot of A's.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.780
And when I say a lot,
it can be hundreds.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.270
And it just promiscuously
keeps on adenylating.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.700
And now what's this bit for?

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.730
Once again, it protects
from exonuclease activity

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.040
from the other
end of the strand.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.830
Because if you have
exonuclease activity,

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.620
you might start munching
away at these As.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.680
But these aren't the important
parts of the messenger, right?

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.240
These are just add-ons.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.230
It's kind of a buffer.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.335
It's like something to
do while you're waiting.

00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:13.710
Oh, I'm going to
chew up some As.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.470
But you're not messing
up the messenger RNA

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.850
that you need at the end.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.790
So it's adding
some dummy sequence

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.360
that will be handy there.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.120
It contributes to stability.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.040
The tail is shortened over
time, but it's non-coding,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.250
so that's OK.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.500
And actually though, when
the tail is short enough,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.220
the polyadenine tail kind
of acts as a bit of a timer.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.760
Because once the
tail gets short,

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.570
you start chewing
into the transcript,

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.930
and you basically end up with a
degradation of the transcript.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.950
But it gives you time in
the cytoplasm for the gene

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.968
to be translated into protein.

00:26:51.968 --> 00:26:53.010
Does that all make sense?

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.610
So it's basically like an egg
timer, just watching, watching;

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.660
back, back, back.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.960
OK, this transcript has
been out here long enough.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.950
We've made all the
protein we need.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.650
Now we're going to chew
up the coding part.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:09.390
And then finally it's
actually a good marker

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.490
again for leaving the nucleus.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.330
And then finally it's kind of
a cool tool for technology,

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:26.420
because there's lots of interest
in characterizing what's

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.990
known as the transcriptome.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:39.010
OK, it's all well and good
to characterize a genome.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.060
But it's a lot of work,
3.2 billion base pairs.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.210
And only a part of
it, a tiny part of it,

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.820
are parts of the genes
that encode the proteins.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.610
So what you'd
really want to know,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:54.070
if you want to
analyze the genes that

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.450
are going to become the proteins
and maybe look for defects,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.770
is look at the things that
are going to be transcribed.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.340
So you can use the
fact that there

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.630
is this poly-A tail on
the transcripts that

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.770
are going to leave the
nucleus with something that

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.810
will pull them out of the mix.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:14.860
What would I use?

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:21.370
Let's say I've got a
resin bead, polystyrene

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.920
or some favorable polymer.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.350
And I can attach covalently
nucleic acids to that bead.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:33.580
What would I add there
to fish this lot out?

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.910
Yeah, up here?

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.422
Yeah.

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.538
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:36.538 --> 00:28:38.080
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
Yeah, a lot of Ts.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.180
So I'm going to make this.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:44.630
I'm going to put on a bunch of
Ts, and I can do this a lot.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.720
This is done very,
very commonly.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.090
And then I'm just
going to fish out

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:54.460
everything that is part of the
transcriptome, not the genome.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.240
So I've got a much smaller
job then to find out errors

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.700
in the genes that
encode the proteins,

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.950
than if I was going to start
with the entire genome.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.250
So pretty cool tool,
and later on we're

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.330
going to see how
this can be used.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.290
It's actually used in concert
with an interesting enzyme

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.800
that comes from viruses
called reverse transcriptase.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.480
But that's a story
for a later day.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.370
But it is a cool story.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:24.430
Now the last thing that
we do in the nucleus

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.740
is arguably the most important.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.715
And that is splicing.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.490
OK, all right.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.250
Once again, this is a picture
with a lot of moving parts.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.360
But I want to convey to
you the point of splicing,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.750
as opposed to you knowing
all the little details.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:53.420
It was noticed for a long
time that the messenger didn't

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.970
always correspond to
the original transcript.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.020
And this is the case
eukaryotes, not in bacteria.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.340
But that there was quite
a lot of processing

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.560
done, not just to cap the
ends, but by cutting out

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:18.820
chunks of the transcript,
so removal of segments

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.780
of the transcript.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.060
And a lot of the
seminal work was

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.120
done by Phillip Sharp, who
is a member of our faculty

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.380
in the Biology Department.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.030
So we're very proud of this.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:37.680
This was actually the topic
of a Nobel Prize in the '90s.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.010
And so what was noticed is that
if you had a gene, and let's

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:53.220
just put it here,
5 prime to 3 prime.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.720
And I'm going to name these.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.910
And then I'll explain
to you what they are.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.210
These would be called exons.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.546
These would be called intros.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.730
And this is another exon.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.730
Outside, inside; that's
the way to remember them.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.330
And what happens in
splicing is that the introns

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.710
are chopped out.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.300
OK, so your gene
then ends up being,

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.240
if this is exon
1 and exon 2, not

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.490
represented by
this entire thing,

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.890
but eliminating that
middle component.

00:31:38.185 --> 00:31:42.550
And remember all the time
we have the cap at 5,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:49.470
we have the poly-A tail ad
infinitum, the 3 prime end.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.850
So we've just
changed the middle.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.780
And it was recognized through
bioinformatics analysis that

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.830
basically noticed the
pieces that was chopped out

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.430
and the pieces that
ended up being joined.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.440
And protein splicing
occurs as a sequence

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.940
of events that ends you up
with the protein being spliced

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.000
together through a
series of rearrangements

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.320
that occur on the structure
of the messenger RNA.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.950
So there is an
internal rearrangement.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.870
A new phosphate is made.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.030
And then there's
another rearrangement,

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.790
where there's a new
bond made between one

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:34.590
end of the pre-messenger
RNA, and the other end

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:38.800
of the pre-messenger
RNA, to give you

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.340
the exon rejoined, ready
to be read in translation.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.020
Now why is this so important?

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.350
So I want to go here
to a few numbers

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.240
that I think are
very pertinent, which

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.830
I had to drill my
colleagues for,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.430
because I didn't
know all the numbers.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.450
So when the genome
was sequenced,

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.270
we were a bit stunned,
because the number

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.760
of coding things
that are genes that

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.740
are going to be
turned into proteins

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.990
was much smaller
than we anticipated.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.830
For man, it's currently
at about 20,000 genes.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:14.620
That's 20,000 mature transcripts
that could make proteins.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.220
Fly?

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:19.400
Not much smaller, arguably
they're pretty smart, 16,000.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.300
Yeast 6,000, a
bacteria at 4,000.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.600
There doesn't seem to be
enough of a difference.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.900
But a huge amount
of diversity is

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.490
introduced into the transcripts
by different splicing events.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.170
Because if you make
one transcript,

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.970
that would count as one gene.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.050
But if there is a lot of
opportunities for difference

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.530
splicing activity,
you can piece together

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:48.860
new transcripts that will
encode proteins differently.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.720
And I think this next
slide will show you

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.270
an example of a transcript that
has several different introns

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.630
and exons.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.940
So you can see here
across, there's

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:06.100
a blue, green, red, another
blue, and an orange exon.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.280
But depending on which
pieces are spliced out,

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.500
we'll have different
proteins end up.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.409
So it could be a
way, for example,

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.800
to think of a practical use, to
have a protein that is either

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.100
secreted as a soluble
protein, or left

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.620
in the membrane with a
membrane association domain,

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.360
or left in the cytoplasm because
it has no way to be secreted.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.580
So it could be a way to
make three proteins that

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.280
are in completely
different places of a cell,

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.260
or have different functions.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.630
It's also very
important in tissues,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.949
because we splice proteins
differently in muscle,

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:45.190
or liver, or heart to
achieve different outcomes

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.989
in the proteins that we make.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:50.620
So basically, it's a
source of huge diversity,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.020
and it gives us the
genetic diversity

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.500
that means this 20,000 can
be a much bigger number.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.000
And then with the
post-translational

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.560
modifications I talk about
when we come back later on,

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.590
you'll see we've got lots of
ways to diversify that 20,000.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.490
That mean these aren't
literal numbers.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.470
They're quite varied.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.560
But what you want to remember
is E. coli doesn't do splicing.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.320
There's no opportunity there.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.540
It's much more limited
in yeast, so is

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.470
the post-translational
modification.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.010
So these numbers settle
out quite differently

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.200
from what they look
like by looking directly

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.150
at those numbers.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.990
And I wanted to
give you an example.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.530
You don't have this
in your slides,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.280
but I was thinking
about it the other day.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.970
A colleague of mine, Professor
Pentelute in chemistry,

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.970
works on trying
to reprogram genes

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:44.590
to overcome a disease known as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.020
It's another genetic disorder.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.550
It's X-linked.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.180
So it's much more serious
in males than in females.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.550
Because if you only have
one bad copy of the gene,

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.300
you can do OK with this disease.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.180
Whereas in the male,
you'd only have

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.880
the component of the gene
that's on the X chromosome.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.130
And it's a defect in RNA
splicing, so directly there.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:14.230
So this is a biopsy
of muscle where

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.950
red would be good muscle
cells, whereas the white would

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.570
be fat cells.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.563
And they actually weaken
the integrity of the muscle,

00:36:25.563 --> 00:36:26.980
because the muscle
doesn't develop

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.890
to have all the well-defined
muscle cells that

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.620
are important for
muscle tensile strength,

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.900
and contractility, and
everything else that muscles

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.500
do.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.250
And it's all related to a
protein known as dystrophin,

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.840
which is a huge protein.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.000
And it's a critical
structural protein

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.570
that's important to maintain
the cellular membranes

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.810
within the muscle cells.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:53.000
So if dystrophin is no good,
the cell membrane integrity

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.900
is no good.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.790
And you just end up
with losing the muscle

00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:00.320
cells, a cost of replacing them
with fat cells in the muscle.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.080
And here's a really
amazing number.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.730
The gene that encodes
dystrophin has 79 exons.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.520
So you can picture the
opportunities for things

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.120
to go wrong, and it's
actually a defect in the place

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.710
where the splicing happens.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.330
So a splicing event
cannot happen.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:22.250
And so the protein at the
end of the day is not good.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.130
So there's a lot of
efforts going on,

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:30.680
antisense efforts, and even
other gene therapy efforts,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.980
and also nowadays there's
obviously a large focus

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.900
on CRISPR-based gene editing.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.170
But remember this is
a serious debilitating

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.480
disease of all muscle tissue.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.528
It starts to be noticed when
the babies are toddlers,

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.070
because that's really
when they start

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.210
to engage muscle strength.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.530
So around the age of four
it's actually noticed.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.010
And then the life
expectancy is in the 30

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.500
to 40-years-old range.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.870
But it's also a
terrible lifestyle,

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.510
because the lungs don't work.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.030
So many things rely
on muscle strength.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.380
OK, good.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.260
All right, so I believe
that's the end of that.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.770
But I want to give you an
introduction to translation,

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.860
so you'll see what we
have in store for Friday.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.230
And just get you
back to this picture,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.710
we've done everything we need.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.800
We've done all the processing.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.940
We're here, and then
the mature messenger RNA

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:30.080
can finally leave the nucleus
to be ready for translation.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.300
And the cap-- there
is a complex that

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:38.150
binds the 5 prime
cap that's tasked

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:45.020
with helping export
that transcript

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.500
through the nuclear pore, which
is a fairly large opening,

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.070
outside into the cytoplasm.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.820
And I want to show
you one other thing

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.900
and I hope I can
get this reliably,

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.600
because with this I'm
going to actually show you

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.370
some of the moving parts.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.090
There's a little
thing on the sidebar

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:07.300
now, called a short translation.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.580
And so what you're seeing
here, the black line

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.270
is the messenger RNA.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.300
OK, so that's the thing
that's finally out

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.580
there in the cytoplasm ready.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.460
The pale green and yellow
are the two components

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.700
of the ribosome, which is
a soluble organelle that

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:28.290
assembles on the double-stranded
DNA based on a few cues.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:33.160
The dark blue components
are transfer RNAs

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.760
that bring in new amino acids.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.220
And what you see
threading out here

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:42.540
is a new protein strand
that is being translated.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.320
This particular translation is
to make a protein that becomes

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.910
membrane bound and secreted.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.440
So I'm not going to
go further than that.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.010
But there's a lot of
those light blue proteins

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.070
that are actually helping
escort the transfer

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.420
RNAs to where they're needed to
continue building the proteins.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.700
So we've seen the messenger.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.890
We'll learn more
about the ribosome,

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.220
and will learn about
the transfer RNAs.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.720
And you can also watch this
to your heart's content.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.600
I just find it just a
useful simple cartoon

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.840
that tells us a lot.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.720
So what I really want
to encourage you to do

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.040
is read this section 14.5,
because the next parts will

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.240
make a great deal more sense.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.640
So what I want to do
though now is first of all,

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.900
start with describing the
players in translation,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.380
and just the way we
did for replication,

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.630
we're going to systematically
ascribe the importance

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.430
to each of these players.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.220
So what you see, there
are molecular players

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.750
and there are key steps.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.060
So the molecular
players are shown here.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:56.010
So far, we've focused very
strongly on the messenger RNA.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.010
You know all about that.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.150
You know where it's from.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.760
You know it's stable in
the cytoplasm for a while.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.910
You know it's got signals
that tell the complexes where

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.800
to go down.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.190
Then we need transfer
RNAs and amino acids,

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.020
and we need the ribosomes.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.890
And ribosomes are made of
a composite of nucleic acid

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.350
and protein wrapped together.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.660
There's quite a big
difference in prokaryotes

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.700
and eukaryotic
ribosomes, and I'll

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.560
mention that when we get to it.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.590
But I want to focus for a
few moments, first of all,

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:32.050
on the landmarks that got us to
finally in 2009 the structure

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.920
of the ribosome.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.500
It's a cool development
for everyone.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.860
But also where we came
from in the '60s, when

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.430
Crick and Brenner finally
cracked the genetic code,

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.610
and found out that three
bases on that messenger

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.240
RNA will encode
each new amino acid

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.790
that gets put into
your protein sequence.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:57.400
So I want to introduce you
to the transfer RNAs that

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.850
are really the most
important element

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:02.200
to start thinking about.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:14.350
And you can call these
guys the decoders,

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.410
because what the
transfer RNA does

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:22.630
is it can carry an amino acid
on one end of its nucleic acid.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.360
But on one of the other
loops within the transfer

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.750
RNA is what's known
as an anticodon that

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:32.610
recognizes a codon
in the messenger RNA,

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.890
and basically prescribes
what amino acids get put in.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.330
So it was always a wonder how
you went from the nucleic acid

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:42.770
world to the protein world.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.960
The answer is you
use a nucleic acid

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.310
that you can load
with an amino acid,

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.390
but it can also recognize
the messenger RNA that codes

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.460
for the protein sequence.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.550
And that's why I like to
think of them as decoders.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:04.870
But what this picture
of the RNA shows you,

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:07.470
is the beautiful
structure of RNA,

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.050
where at one end is where an
amino acid would be attached.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.080
There's this cool kind
of cloverleaf structure.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.200
And then at the other
end is the anticodon loop

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.960
that will actually recognize
your messenger RNA.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.330
So I'm going to stop now.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.840
But I really want to
encourage you, just skim

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.300
through that small section.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.120
It'll make a lot
more sense on Friday.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.470
I've been waiting to talk to
you about protein translation

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.890
since we started this class.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.780
But it'll make a lot more sense.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.400
And there's some super cool
initiatives in chemical biology

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.270
now, where people have been
able to completely hijack

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.820
protein translation,
and not put in just

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.000
20 regular boring amino
acids, but actually

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.770
put in all kinds of
other amino acids.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:59.140
So we understand the system
well enough to manipulate it.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.380
And this really hearkens
to the Feynman quotes,

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.780
"If you can build it,
you can understand it."

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.600
That's the level to which
we understand translation

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.500
nowadays.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.500
That's it for today.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ:
All right, so we

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
proved these two theorems last
time, and we used them for--

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and we had a couple of
applications of them.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So the first theorem,
simple theorem,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
was that a sequence converges to
x if and only if the limit as n

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of the absolute
value of xn minus x goes to 0.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we also had the squeeze
theorem, that if you have two--

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
if you have three
sequences-- a sub n,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
b sub n, and x sub n-- so that
x sub n is in between a sub

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
n and b sub n, and the a
sub n and b sub n converge

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
to the same thing, then the
sequence x sub n converges,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and it converges
to the [? common ?]

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:90%
limit of a sub n and b sub n.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So x sub n gets squeezed in
between a sub n and b sub n.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Last time we used this to
prove a kind of special limit

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
that this equals 0 if
the absolute value of c

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
is less than 1.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So I had proved it for
c positive, and maybe

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:84%
c less than 1-- but same proof
works with absolute values,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
just because the absolute
value of c to the n

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:84%
equals the absolute value of
c raised to the n-th power.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's use this
to do a few more

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:90%
special limits if you like.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But first, I'm going to
state the binomial theorem.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to prove it,
but it's a simple exercise

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:90%
using induction.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And the binomial theorem says
that [? for all ?] [? N, the ?]

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
natural numbers, x, y in R, x
plus y raised to the n is equal

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.875 align:middle line:84%
to the sum from k equals
0 to n of n choose k,

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
x to the n minus k y to the k.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And here n choose k--

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to n factorial
over k factorial divided

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:90%
by n minus--

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:90%
times n minus k factorial.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So again, you can prove
this by inducting on n.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We have a theorem, so we'll
prove a few special limits.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I have a real number
that's positive.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.356 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Then the limit as n
goes to infinity of 1

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.115 align:middle line:90%
over n the p equals 0.

00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:84%
If p is positive,
then limit as n

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of p to
the 1 over n equals 1.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.625 align:middle line:90%
And the third is--

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:52.121 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
it's just that a
certain limit exists--

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
limit as n goes to infinity
of n to the 1 over n equals 1.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Let me make a
small comment here.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So far in our discussion
of the real numbers,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
we've only defined what it
means to take a real number

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to an integer power, but--

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:90%
and n-th roots.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have n-th
powers and n-th roots.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So using that, we
can then define

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.698 align:middle line:84%
how to take a real number
to a rational power--

00:04:35.698 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
although there needs
to be something that's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
checked to make sure
this is well-defined,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
because you can always write
a rational number not uniquely

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:90%
as one integer over another.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.950 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So we can define a positive
real number to a rational power,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
but using really only
the elementary facts

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
about the real numbers, the
fact that it has the least upper

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.627 align:middle line:84%
bound property, and the fact
that the rationales are somehow

00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
dense in the real
numbers, we can then

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
define what it means to
take a positive real number

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:90%
to a positive real number power.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
All of that is just to say
that to define a positive real

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
number to a positive real number
or to a real number of power

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
doesn't require the
introduction of the exponential

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
or logarithm-- although
they, in the end too--

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
they both agree, once you
do have the exponential

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:90%
and the logarithm.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So all of that is
just to say that

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:90%
what we've done up to now--

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
these things actually
do make sense.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the
exponential and the logarithm

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of a
positive real number

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:90%
to a real number of power.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But we're just going to use the
basic properties of exponents

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
throughout all
this, so we don't--

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
we haven't even talked about
continuity, or derivatives,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
or anything like
that, so we'll just

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
use elementary means to be
able to prove these statements.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So for the first one, we'll
prove this actually just

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
using the definition of
the limit, which, remember,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
means for every
epsilon positive there,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:84%
we should be able to find
a capital number M, such

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that if n is bigger than
or equal to capital M,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:84%
1 over n to the p is
less than epsilon.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Choose M, a natural
number, such that M

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:90%
is greater than or equal to--

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
is greater than 1 over
epsilon to the 1 over p.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And if n is bigger
than or equal to M,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.155 align:middle line:84%
1 over n to the p minus
0, which equals 1 over n

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to the p-- this is less than
or equal to 1 over capital

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:90%
M to the p.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:90%
So here, again, I'm using--

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
an elementary fact
that we all know

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
is that, if I have a
positive power here, then--

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and little n is bigger
than or equal to capital M

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
then into the p would be bigger
than or equal to capital M

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
to the p.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
We do know that for
integer exponents,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
but just trust me that one can
define non-integer exponents,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and that inequality remains
true as long as the power

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.103 align:middle line:90%
that you're using is positive.

00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So I have 1 over n
to the p is less than

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 1 over
capital M to the p.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And by our choice of capital
M, this is less than epsilon.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So that proves number one.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So number two we'll do--

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
we really only need
to do two cases.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:90%
One is p.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.455 align:middle line:90%
So p equals 1 is fine.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
This is clear, because
then I just get 1

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:90%
for the whole sequence.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's one case.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.375 align:middle line:90%
Now let me do p bigger than 1.

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:42.875 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And if p is bigger than
1, the absolute value

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
of p to the 1 over n minus
1-- this is just p to the 1

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:90%
over n minus 1.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to show that
this quantity here goes to 0.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have an inequality
which we proved actually

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
in the second lecture, I
think, using induction,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
but you can actually get from
binomial theorem as well.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So let me just recall
this right here,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that we had this
inequality that, if x

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to minus 1,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
then 1 plus x raised to the n
is bigger than or equal to 1

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:90%
plus nx.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we use this inequality
now with x equals p minus 1.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So p-- this is equal to 1
plus p to the 1 over n minus 1

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
raised to the n-th power.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry. x is p to the 1
over n minus 1, not p minus 1.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And now we use this inequality.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.925 align:middle line:84%
This is bigger than or equal
to this thing times n plus 1.

00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:90%
So then I'll go over here.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So now subtracting the
1 and dividing by n

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:84%
tells me that p to
the 1 over n minus 1

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to p minus 1 over n.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we noted here,
since p is bigger than 1,

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
this is bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And now we apply
the squeeze theorem.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
By squeeze theorem,
this is just going to 0.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:90%
p minus 1 divided by n--

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
that's just a number over n.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
This goes to 0 as
n goes to infinity.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And in, fact that's
contained in number 1 for p

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
equals 1, and also
by our limit facts

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that we proved from last
time, that the limit respects

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
algebraic operations
of the real numbers.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze theorem,
since this converges to 0

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and this converges
to 0, this converges

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:90%
to 0, which implies that.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So that deals with the
case p is bigger than 1.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:84%
To deal with p less than 1, we
use the case p bigger than 1,

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and again, the fact that limits
respect algebraic operations.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Then we write the limit as p--

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
ugly looking p--
write that better--

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
the limit as n goes to
infinity up to the 1/n.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Now p is less than 1,
so 1/p is bigger than 1.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the limit as
n goes to infinity of 1 over 1

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:90%
over p to the 1/n.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And now 1/p is bigger than
1-- raised to the 1/n power

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
converges to 1 by the
case we did before.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And so 1 over this
converges to 1/1 equals 1.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me just
remark that, although we

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:90%
did prove this inequality for--

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
by induction, it
actually follows

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:90%
from the binomial theorem.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use the
binomial theorem

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit of
a different inequality

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that we'll use for number 3.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So for number 3, we
want to prove limit

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of
n over 1 over n equals 1.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So rather than keep writing
n to the 1 over n minus 1,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
which I want to show
convergence to 0 now,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to write xn.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So let xn equal n
to the 1/n minus

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
1, which we note is bigger
than or equal to 0 for all n.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And so my goal I want to
show is limit as x as n

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
x sub n equals 0,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:84%
because then that proves
that this converges to 0.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And since this is equal
to its absolute value,

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.163 align:middle line:84%
that means that n to
the 1/n converges to 1.

00:14:11.163 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And the way we're
going to do that

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
is using an inequality we get
from the binomial theorem--

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and using this trick here.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at plus x
to the n raised to the n,

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:90%
this is just--

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that's just n-- let me
move it over a little bit--

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
plus x to the n raised
the n. x to the n--

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:90%
x sub n is n to the 1/n minus 1.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Add 1.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:90%
I get into n to the 1/n--

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:90%
raised to n, I get n.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the binomial
theorem, this

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is equal to sum from k
equals 0 to n, n choose k.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I have 1 raised to
the n minus k power, x

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:90%
to to the n raised of the k.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a sum of
non-negative things

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:84%
because, x sub n is
always non-negative.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And these coefficients are
just quotients of factorials,

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
so they're always
non-negative as well.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
This sum is always bigger
than or equal to 1 term

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:90%
from the sum.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's bigger than or equal
to k equals 2 [INAUDIBLE] y2--

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:90%
you'll see-- x sub n squared.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, n choose 2--
this is equal to n

00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
factorial over 2 factorial n
minus 2 factorial x to the n

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:09.861 align:middle line:84%
squares x of n squared, which
equals n times n minus 1 over 2

00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:90%
x of n squared.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I started off
with n and I proved

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:84%
it was bigger than or equal
to this quantity here.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So now I divide what's
in front of the x of in

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:90%
and take square roots.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So then that implies that,
for n in bigger than 1--

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
because I need to
divide by n minus 1--

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
0, which is bigger
than or equal to n,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
x sub n is less than or equal
to 2 over n minus 1 square root.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And now this is just 0,
so it converges to 0.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:84%
This right-hand side is square
root of 2 over n minus 1.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
Now, the limit as n goes to
infinity of 2 over n minus 1

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:90%
is 0.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Square root of that
also converges to 0.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
That's a fact we did from
the end of last time.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing
converges to 0.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze theorem, limit
as n goes to infinity of x sub

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
n-- which, remember, this is
just n to the 1 over n minus 1,

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.455 align:middle line:90%
which implies--

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And that completes the proof.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now we are going
to study a couple of objects

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:90%
related to a bounded sequence.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.946 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
What's the underlying question
we're going to try to answer?

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Whenever something's
introduced, you

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
should think of it
in terms of, what's

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
the question that was asked
that this is trying to answer?

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're now moving on to the
topic of limsup and liminf

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.545 align:middle line:90%
of a sequence.

00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:90%
So here's the question.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen sequences that
don't necessarily converge,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:90%
like minus 1 to the n, but--

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and we know about
subsequences now,

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
where you just pick
entries along the sequence.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
You pick one, move to the
right, and pick the next one.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
minus 1 to the n,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
if I just look at the
subsequence consisting

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:90%
of picking the odd entries--

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
the odd numbered
entries in the sequence,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:84%
then I'd just get
minus 1 minus 1 minus 1

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.728 align:middle line:90%
for my new subsequence.

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And this converges.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just constant.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Or if I chose the even
ones, I'd get 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And that converges.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So this sequence,
which is bounded,

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:90%
has a convergent subsequence.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, not all sequences have
convergent subsequences.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look at
the sequence x sub n equals n--

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
so x sub n is just 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, and so on--

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that will not have any
convergent subsequences,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
because any subsequence of
that has to be unbounded.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty easy to show.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And we know that a convergent
sequence is bounded.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:90%
So what am I getting at?

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So the question that we're
going to ask and try to answer

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:90%
is the following.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:33.809 align:middle line:84%
Does every bounded sequence
have a convergent subsequence?

00:20:33.809 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I was just
going on about right

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.635 align:middle line:84%
there is that we
know this is true,

00:20:44.635 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, for the
sequence minus 1 to the n.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
We also this is true for
convergent sequences.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Convergent sequences
are bounded, so--

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and they have
convergent subsequences.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Just take the subsequence
to be the whole sequence

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have to throw
in this bounded part,

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
because there are
sequences that don't have

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:90%
any convergent subsequences.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Like I just said,
x sub n equals n

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
is an example of an unbounded
sequence that doesn't have

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:90%
any convergent subsequences.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to this
question, as we'll see,

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:90%
is yes, this is a very--

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
really a very
powerful statement.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is due to
Bolzano and Weierstrass.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'll restate
it in a little bit

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
when we get to the
statement of that theorem--

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
namely, that every
bounded sequence does

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:90%
have a convergent subsequence.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:84%
There are several different
ways to prove this theorem.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
We're going to prove it by
introducing limsup and liminf,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
because these are also
two important objects that

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:90%
arise in analysis.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to the
definition of these guys.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:90%
So let xn be bounded sequence.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:37.525 align:middle line:84%
And we define-- if
they exist, there

00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
are going to be certain limits,
so it's not clear that they

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:90%
exist at all to begin with.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:84%
But we'll show that
they always do exist.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:90%
We define limsup x sub n.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'll write n
goes to infinity underneath.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll just
write limsup or I'll just

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:90%
have an n underneath it.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to
be a number, and this

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the limit
as n goes to infinity

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
of a new sequence obtained
from the old sequence x sub n.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
What are the entries
of this new sequence?

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
This is sup of x of k, k
bigger than or equal to n.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:30.655 align:middle line:84%
And the liminf is similar,
except it's now with infs.

00:23:30.655 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So for each natural
number n, I take

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
the supremum of the set
of elements x sub k for k

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
bigger than or equal to n.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is a bounded set
because the sequence is bounded.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So this the supremum is
well-defined-- same thing

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:90%
for the inf.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So I get a number, a
new number for each n.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I take the limit
of those numbers and I

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:84%
define one to be the limsup,
one to be the liminf,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.500 align:middle line:90%
if they exist--

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
because limits
don't always exist,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
so it's not even clear that
these two limits actually

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:90%
are meaningful.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing that we'll do

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.425 align:middle line:84%
is we'll prove that these
limits do actually always exist.

00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So rather than keep writing
this, I'm going to give these--

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
write some symbols
for these two things.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:90%
So let a sub n to be--

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:84%
so of course, if I forget to
say this at least in what I'm

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
talking about with respect
to limsup and liminf,

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm always talking
about a bound sequence.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But let me continue to state
that as one of my hypotheses.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Let x of n be a
bounded sequence,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and let a sub n be the supremum
of the set of all elements

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:84%
x sub k, where k is bigger
than or equal to n, and b

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:84%
to be the infimum of x sub k,
a bigger than or equal to n.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So then there's
couple of statements.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
One is that the
sequence a sub n--

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
so let me just
put over here what

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.145 align:middle line:84%
these things have to do
with the limsup and liminf.

00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Then the limsup of x sub n--

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
this is defined to be the
limit as n goes to infinity

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:90%
of the a sub n's.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And the liminf of x sub n-- this
is defined to be the limit as n

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity
of the b sub n's.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to show is
that the limit of a sub n as n

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of a sub n
exists, and the limit as n

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity
of b sub n exists.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So how we're going
to show that is we're

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
going to show that
a sub n is monotone

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:55.355 align:middle line:90%
decreasing and bounded.

00:26:55.355 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
the conclusions.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So [INAUDIBLE] should say then.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.983 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
The sequence b sub n is
monotone increasing and bounded.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, since
we know that, if we

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
have a monotone sequence which
is bounded, it has to converge,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.255 align:middle line:84%
that means these
two limits exist.

00:27:47.255 --> 00:27:50.828 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.828 --> 00:27:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
part of this term

00:27:52.370 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is the simple statement
that the liminf of x sub n

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
limsup [INAUDIBLE] x sub n.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.715 align:middle line:90%
OK, to prove one--

00:28:19.715 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:84%
so in fact, before I
prove this theorem,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:84%
let me prove a small
simple theorem first.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's put the proof
of this theorem

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:84%
on hold just for a second, and
now prove a very simple theorem

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that, if A and B are subsets
of real numbers, A, B,

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:84%
both not equal to the empty
set, and is A subset of B--

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:90%
so also need to be bounded.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So if we take two non-empty
subsets of real numbers,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:84%
such that [INAUDIBLE] bounded
and A is a subset of B,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and the conclusion
is that the inf of B

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to the inf of A.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is always less than
or equal to the sup of A,

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and this is less than or
equal to the sup of B.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So what this says is that,
if I take a subset of B,

00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:00.240 align:middle line:84%
then that increases the
inf and decreases the sup.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:00.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So the sup of a
smaller set is smaller

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:90%
than the sup of the bigger set.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And that inequality
reverses for infs.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The inf of the smaller
set is bigger than

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the inf
of the bigger set.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And this just
follows immediately

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
from the definition
of sup and inf,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.560 align:middle line:84%
so I'll just prove
the sup statement.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So since sup of B is
an upper bound for B,

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and A is a subset
of B, this implies

00:30:47.240 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
that sup B is an upper bound for
A. Sup B sits above everything

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and B. A's a subset of B, so
it sits above everything for A.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the supremum of A is
supposed to be the least upper

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:84%
bound, and therefore, if I
take any upper bound for A,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that has to be bigger than
or equal to the sup of A.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So since sup B is an
upper bound for A,

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:23.187 align:middle line:84%
this implies that sup A is
less than or equal to sup B--

00:31:23.187 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and similarly with the infs,
so I'm not going to write--

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.685 align:middle line:90%
so similar for infs.

00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go back to
the proof of this theorem

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:84%
here, that if I have
a bounded sequence,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:84%
then the limsup and
the liminf exist.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And we show that by proving
that these two sequences have

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.190 align:middle line:90%
these monotonicity properties.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So proof now of the
theorem we were--

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:90%
started off proving--

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.405 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.405 --> 00:32:16.905 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:16.905 --> 00:32:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Since the set of xk's,
with k bigger than

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:84%
or equal to n plus 1, is
a subset of xk's for k

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:90%
bigger than or equal to n--

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
because now I'm-- I have a set
where k's starting at n plus 1.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Here's a set with
k starting at n,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:84%
so this is clearly
contained in here.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:84%
This implies that
a sub n plus 1,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the sup of
the left hand side,

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
by this little theorem
that I stated here,

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
the sup of the bigger set.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is just a sub n.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.200 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So we've proven, for all n,
a sub n plus 1 is less than

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:90%
or equal to a sub n.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this sequence
is monotone decreasing.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And so this uses the sup part
of this previous theorem,

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:84%
but if we use the inf
part, then we also get

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:90%
the statement for the b sub n.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.058 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.058 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So rather than write
out the details,

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll leave it to you just to
flip around the inequalities

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.010 align:middle line:90%
for the inf in your notes.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:34:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, for all N,
a natural number, b sub n

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal
to b sub n plus 1--

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:90%
or other way.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, so that shows these
two sequences are monotone.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Now we show they're bounded.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And this follows
simply from the fact

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.310 align:middle line:90%
that the x sub n's are bounded.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Since there exist a b
bigger than or equal to 0,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:44.425 align:middle line:84%
such that all N natural numbers,
x sub n in absolute value

00:34:44.425 --> 00:34:45.800 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to b, which

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
is the same as saying b is--

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:84%
x sub n is bounded between
minus B and capital B.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So taken as elements
of each of these sets,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.100 align:middle line:84%
if you like this x of k, k
bigger than or equal to n,

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that means minus B is
always a lower bound

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
for these sets and B is always
an upper bound for these sets.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So this implies that
minus B is always

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:28.310 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to x sub k,
k bigger than or equal to n.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And this always sits
below the supremum.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Since all of these are
bounded above by B,

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
the supremum has to be
less than or equal to B,

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
which I'll state in terms of the
a sub n's and b sub n's-- means

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
minus B is less than or equal
to b sub n is less than or equal

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to a sub n is less
than or equal to b.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:90%
So these sequences are bounded.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, these
two implies that--

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:17.190 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
all right, so we've shown
that these two sequences

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:20.790 align:middle line:90%
that define--

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that we use to define
the limsup and the liminf

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
are monotone and bounded,
so therefore, the limit

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%
of these two sequences--

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:84%
the limits, which define
the limsup and liminf,

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:90%
actually exist.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So limsup and liminf is
always a well-defined object.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, this proves one.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:84%
To prove two, this
follows immediately

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.350 align:middle line:84%
from what we've
proven right here.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So by this part,
we have b sub n is

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.100 align:middle line:90%
less than or equal to a sub n.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So for all n, I have
these two sequences,

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.760 align:middle line:90%
one sitting below the other.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And last time we proved that
taking the limit respects

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:84%
inequality, so limit as n
goes to infinity of b sub n--

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:90%
which is the liminf--

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:16.477 align:middle line:84%
sits below limit as n
goes to infinity of a sub

00:37:16.477 --> 00:37:19.536 align:middle line:90%
n, which is the limsup.

00:37:19.536 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:90%
And that completes the proof.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So I've shown that these
two objects we defined--

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:90%
the limsup and the liminf--

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
exist, and are well-defined
for every bounded sequence.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of--

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.380 align:middle line:84%
can be a little bit
of a daunting couple

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.090 align:middle line:84%
of objects to come
across when you--

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:84%
especially in your
first analysis class.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.843 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing to
do is look at examples.

00:37:55.843 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you come
across something

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that you just don't
quite understand,

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:04.990 align:middle line:84%
start writing down
some actual things.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's again
look at our favorite example

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of a bounded sequence
which does not converge,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.085 align:middle line:90%
x sub n equals minus 1 to the n.

00:38:19.085 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Then, if I am looking
at this set x sub n,

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:35.248 align:middle line:84%
n bigger than or equal
to k, and writing--

00:38:35.248 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
instead of x sub n,
let me just write

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:90%
what it is, minus 1 to the n.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.660 align:middle line:90%
So what is this set?

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:84%
This is just a set consisting
of two elements, 1 and minus 1.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
sup of this set,

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:84%
which is the sup of
this set, is just 1.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Oops-- so if I take--

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:84%
which implies that
the limsup of minus 1

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.330 align:middle line:84%
to the n, which
is the limit as n

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of sup
minus 1 to the n, n bigger

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to the
k-- as we just saw,

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.590 align:middle line:84%
this is just the sup of this set
consisting of two elements, 1

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and minus 1.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to the limit as n
goes to infinity of 1 equals 1.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So the limsup of
minus 1 to the n is 1.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I change all
these sups to infs,

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:84%
then the inf of
this set is going

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to be the inf of this set,
which is just minus 1.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.645 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, we also get--

00:39:58.645 --> 00:40:07.370 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:90%
So the limsup is 1.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.672 align:middle line:84%
The liminf is minus
1 for this set.

00:40:16.672 --> 00:40:19.130 align:middle line:84%
That's just supposed to be a
squiggly line, not necessarily

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.160 align:middle line:90%
looking like sigma.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, so there's one sequence.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:37.060 align:middle line:84%
How about our next favorite
sequence, x sub n equals 1/n?

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So the set of elements
1/n, such that n

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal--
so 1/k I should write.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, so I was using some--

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.200 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:90%
this should have been a k.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Hope didn't make that
mistake throughout.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.414 align:middle line:90%
No, I kept writing x sub k.

00:41:01.414 --> 00:41:03.335 align:middle line:90%
So that should be x sub k.

00:41:03.335 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, all of that is
written correctly.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:84%
This should have been
minus 1 to the k--

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.515 align:middle line:90%
minus 1 to the k.

00:41:21.515 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:90%
All right, very good.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at now the
set 1 over k, where n is--

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.850 align:middle line:84%
where k is bigger
than or equal to n.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a set 1/n, 1/n
plus 1, 1/n plus 2, 1/n plus 3,

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So as I move to the
next entry, things

00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:90%
are getting smaller and smaller.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this sequence
just here now, written as--

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:90%
thinking of this as a new--

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:84%
so this is not a
sequence-- this is a set.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Taking entries to
be these guys, it's

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:90%
easy to see that converges to 0.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, let's say
I take the supremum

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
of this set, which is what I
need to compute the limsup.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now taking the
supremum of this set.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:84%
1/n plus 1-- that's always
smaller than 1/n, and so

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is 1/n plus 2, and
so on and so on.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And 1/n is an element
of the set that's

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.800 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to
everything else in the set.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's an
exercise in the homework

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that-- as you just
show, that if you

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.083 align:middle line:84%
have a set that contains
an element which

00:42:49.083 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound for
the set, then that

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:90%
has to be the supremum.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So the supremum of
this set is simply 1/n.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So this supremum
is equal to 1/n.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So as n goes to infinity, the
limit of the supremum here,

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:84%
which equals the limit as n goes
to infinity of 1/n, equals 0.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:90%
So the limsup of 1/n equals 0.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.006 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.006 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But now let's say I look
at infs of this set.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So I had to take sups
to look at the limsup.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Now let's say I take infs.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the inf of
this set-- these are

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.740 align:middle line:84%
elements that are getting closer
and closer and closer to 0.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's 0, 1/n,
and then they just

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.170 align:middle line:84%
keep getting smaller and
smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:90%
converging to 0.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can, in fact, prove
this rigorously if you'd like,

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.460 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's easy to
at least convince yourself

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that infimum of this
set is equal to 0.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:84%
The smallest thing--
so first off, 0

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.540 align:middle line:90%
is a lower bound for this set.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And if I take anything
bigger than 0,

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.015 align:middle line:84%
that thing cannot be an upper
bound simply because of, if you

00:44:38.015 --> 00:44:40.640 align:middle line:84%
like the Archimedean property,
I can always find something from

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the set less than that real--

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.150 align:middle line:90%
positive real number.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So 0 must be the
least upper bound.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, the liminf
of 1/n, which is the inf--

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:84%
the limit as n goes to infinity
of the inf of this set,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:05.590 align:middle line:84%
is just the limit as n goes
to infinity of 0 equals

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.510 align:middle line:90%
0, all right.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:11.180 align:middle line:90%
So the limsup of 1/n equals 0.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:90%
The liminf equals 0 as well.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:20.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:34.650 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at these
two examples a little bit,

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and let me just
make a few remarks.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
First off, what's to
notice about this sequence

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.350 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
the limsup is 1.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Liminf is equal to minus 1.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So the limsup does
not equal the liminf.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.680 align:middle line:84%
However, in this example,
the limsup, which is 0,

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:90%
equals the liminf, which is 0.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the difference
between these two sequences?

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
What's the property that one
holds, but the-- one has,

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.180 align:middle line:90%
but the other doesn't?

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.895 align:middle line:84%
This is a convergent
sequence and this one is not.

00:46:16.895 --> 00:46:19.588 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.588 --> 00:46:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see this
is a general fact,

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that if we have a
convergent sequence,

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:27.330 align:middle line:84%
then the limsup and the
liminf equal each other

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and are equal to the limit
of the original sequence,

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.620 align:middle line:84%
because this sequence
converges to 0.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But that's not just
a one-way street.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a two-way street
that, in fact, we'll prove,

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:44.080 align:middle line:84%
if the limsup equals the liminf,
then the original sequence

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.040 align:middle line:90%
converges.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence
converges if and only

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:90%
if the limsup equals the liminf.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And we saw here that in--

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.140 align:middle line:84%
on display, that the
limsup and the liminf

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:84%
don't equal each other,
and the original sequence,

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.370 align:middle line:90%
which we know--

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.065 align:middle line:84%
or shown last time--
doesn't converge.

00:47:03.065 --> 00:47:10.730 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And so one other thing I'd
like to point out is that--

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.430 align:middle line:90%
so the limsup of this guy is 1.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The liminf of this
guy is a minus 1.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can also find a
subsequence which converges

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.220 align:middle line:90%
to 1, which is the limsup.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We just take the
entries that we choose

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to be the even numbered
entries, and that just gives--

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.830 align:middle line:90%
produces a sequence 1.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And that sequence
converges to 1.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:41.880 align:middle line:84%
If we take the odd
entries of the sequence,

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that subsequence is just minus
1 and converges to minus 1,

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:45.950 align:middle line:90%
which is the liminf.

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's also a
general fact will prove,

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that for any bounded
sequence, there

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:84%
exists some sequences converging
to the limsup and the liminf.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And that will give us the proof
of this Bolzano-Weierstrass

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:57.980 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.600 align:middle line:90%


00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.550 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's all of
the remarks I want to say.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And let me make one
other important comment.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So this sequence, which we use
to define the limsup and also

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.100 align:middle line:90%
the liminf--

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.770 align:middle line:84%
in three out of
these four cases,

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.080 align:middle line:90%
they were actual subsequences.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So the sup of this
set equals 1, which

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I can consider as a subsequence
of the original guy--

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing
for the liminf.

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:84%
The inf of this set
was minus 1, which

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I can consider as a subsequence
of minus 1 to the n.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And for the sup of this set,
I got 1/n, which I can--

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.520 align:middle line:84%
this is just equal to
the original sequence.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, I can consider
it as a subsequence

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.120 align:middle line:90%
of the original sequence.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But if I take the infimum
of this set, which

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I need to define
the liminf, I got 0

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.260 align:middle line:84%
for every entry, which
is not a subsequence

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.910 align:middle line:90%
of this original sequence.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:05.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So all of that is to say
that the sequences I get

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.670 align:middle line:84%
through this process to
define the limsup and liminf

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:18.120 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily subsequences
of the original sequence.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:18.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.730 align:middle line:84%
What I just said a minute
ago about there actually

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.860 align:middle line:84%
being some sequences
which do converge

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to the limsup and liminf--

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.105 align:middle line:84%
this is a non-trivial fact,
which we're going to prove.

00:49:31.105 --> 00:49:37.740 align:middle line:90%


00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So theorem-- and this will
give us the Bolzano-Weierstrass

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:47.960 align:middle line:84%
essentially immediately
right after it--

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.265 align:middle line:90%
let xn be a bounded sequence.

00:49:58.265 --> 00:50:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists subsequences
xn sub k and xm sub k--

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:22.890 align:middle line:84%
so they don't necessarily have
to be the same subsequence--

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:28.890 align:middle line:84%
such that limit as k goes
to infinity of x sub n sub k

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:90%
equals the limsup--

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.160 align:middle line:84%
so it's a convergent
subsequence--

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and the limit as k goes
to infinity of xm sub k

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.050 align:middle line:90%
produces the liminf.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:47.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so before I prove this,
this immediately gives

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:84%
the Bolzano-Weierstrass
theorem, which

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:middle line:84%
is that every bounded sequence
has a convergence subsequence.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:30.740 align:middle line:90%


00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, this
follows immediately

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.725 align:middle line:84%
from the previous
theorem, because if I

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:38.780 align:middle line:84%
take a bounded sequence,
by the previous theorem,

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I can find a subsequence
which converges

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to the limsup, which always
exists for a bounded sequence.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And then that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have
something stronger,

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:84%
in that we have at least
two subsequences which

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.860 align:middle line:84%
converge to these two
numbers, which may or may not

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.270 align:middle line:90%
be the same.

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So the reason this is so
powerful and so strong

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:90%
is that it--

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.530 align:middle line:84%
to get your hands
on something, it

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:middle line:84%
doesn't require you
to show something

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.450 align:middle line:84%
as strong as showing there is
a sequence converging to that.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So quite often, you can think in
terms of variational problems,

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:84%
where you want to show
that a minimum of something

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.010 align:middle line:84%
always exists or a maximum
of something always exists.

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you can try and
do is take a sequence of guys

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that you stick into your--
so this is a general nonsense

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that you stick into your machine
or function that spits out

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.845 align:middle line:90%
output.

00:52:54.845 --> 00:52:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And these outputs are
approaching the maximum

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:90%
or approaching the minimum.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And what you'd like to say
is that there does, in fact,

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:06.880 align:middle line:84%
exist an element that you
can stick into your machine

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.965 align:middle line:84%
and produce the maximum
amount of output.

00:53:08.965 --> 00:53:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe it's not
clear how to do that.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So first, take a
sequence approaching--

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:84%
so that the values
are approaching that--

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.110 align:middle line:84%
the outputs are
approaching the maximum.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could show that the
inputs converge to something,

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.940 align:middle line:84%
but that's typically
really hard.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to work that
hard is what this theorem says.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It says that what you
really need to do,

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and which is much more
straightforward, or simpler,

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.970 align:middle line:84%
or impossible really, is to show
that that sequence of inputs

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that you put into your
machine to get the outputs

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.930 align:middle line:90%
is a bounded sequence.

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:52.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you could pass to a
subsequence, which actually

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.500 align:middle line:84%
does converge to
something by this theorem,

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and proceed in that way
by showing that you do

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:05.130 align:middle line:90%
have some minimum or maximum--

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.930 align:middle line:84%
some input that produces
a maximum output

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:12.680 align:middle line:90%
or minimum output.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's a bit small bit of
rambling about why this theorem

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:23.508 align:middle line:84%
is so useful is
that, again, it's--

00:54:23.508 --> 00:54:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to get your hands on
something that typically you

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:29.210 align:middle line:84%
want to study,
it's very difficult

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to show convergence to that
thing you want to study,

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:36.980 align:middle line:84%
or that thing exists,
because there's a sequence

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that you come up with ad
hoc actually converges

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:40.790 align:middle line:90%
to that thing.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But this theorem says you
don't need to work that hard

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.635 align:middle line:90%
or try to do the impossible.

00:54:45.635 --> 00:54:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And typically, it's
much easier just

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.620 align:middle line:84%
to proceed by showing your
sequence of inputs is bounded.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's enough of that
bit of rambling about why

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:90%
this theorem is so useful.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:03.410 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's also useful in the study
of PDEs, which is what I study.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:90%
So I have a soft spot for it.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of its
generalizations--

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.710 align:middle line:84%
all right, so let's
prove this theorem

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that there exists some sequences
which converge to the limsup

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.650 align:middle line:90%
and liminf.

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So as before, I'm going to
use-- rather than keep writing

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.287 align:middle line:90%
the supremum of this set and--

00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:34.370 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm not even
going to do this statement.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave
this as an exercise.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this statement.

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:42.095 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use this
notation a sub n, as before--

00:55:42.095 --> 00:55:44.600 align:middle line:90%


00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:54.875 align:middle line:84%
a sub n b sup of x sub k's,
k bigger than or equal to n.

00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So I want to show that
there's something converging

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.140 align:middle line:84%
to the limit as n goes to
infinity of the a sub n's.

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.223 align:middle line:90%


00:56:02.223 --> 00:56:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.720 align:middle line:84%
going to try up a subsequence
of elements between a sub n

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and a sub n minus something
which is converging to 0,

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.320 align:middle line:90%
and not quite a sub n.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So it'll be along a
subsequence as well.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there
exists an n sub 1

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.560 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal
to 1 simply by how

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.270 align:middle line:84%
this is defined as a
supremum, and by the exercise

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:38.970 align:middle line:84%
from assignment 3 that
there exists an n sub 1

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:44.370 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to 1
such that a sub 1 minus 1

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:53.060 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to is
less than x sub 1 is less than

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.370 align:middle line:90%
or equal to a sub 1.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:01.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:08.210 align:middle line:84%
a sub 1 minus 1 is not an upper
bound for the set a sub 1,

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:12.620 align:middle line:84%
which is x sub k's, where k's
bigger than or equal to 1.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I should
be able to find

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.510 align:middle line:84%
an element from this set
strictly bigger than that.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
always less than

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:21.570 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the supremum,
which is a sub 1.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:22.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, since a sub n sub 1 plus
1-- so a sub n sub 1 plus 1,

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.060 align:middle line:90%
not 1 plus 1--

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:50.310 align:middle line:84%
since this thing equals
the supremum of xk, such--

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:56.250 align:middle line:84%
k is bigger than or
equal to of 1 plus 1,

00:57:56.250 --> 00:58:01.855 align:middle line:90%
there exists an a sub n sub 2--

00:58:01.855 --> 00:58:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:11.360 align:middle line:84%
at least there exists an n sub
2 bigger than n sub 1-- in fact,

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.280 align:middle line:84%
it has to be bigger than or
equal to n sub 1 plus 1--

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:24.940 align:middle line:84%
such that a sub n plus 1 minus
1/2 is less than a sub n sub 2

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to a sub n plus 1.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:29.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So why the n sub 1
plus 1 is because I

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:40.580 align:middle line:84%
wanted to obtain a new
entry from the sequence that

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.850 align:middle line:84%
comes from farther
than the index n sub 1.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:45.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to build
a subsequence.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the idea is
I want to somehow sandwich--

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.630 align:middle line:90%
this should be x sub n--

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to build up
a subsequence which

00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is sandwiched between things
converging to the limsup,

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.760 align:middle line:90%
and use the squeeze theorem.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.260 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:12.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so since this is
the supremum of this set

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that-- and because
this thing is not

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.070 align:middle line:84%
an upper bound for
this set, there

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:21.690 align:middle line:84%
exists something from the set--
so some element k bigger than

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.200 align:middle line:84%
or equal to n sub 1 plus 1,
which I'm going to call n sub

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.700 align:middle line:84%
2, so that x sub
n sub 2 is bigger

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:34.210 align:middle line:84%
than a sub n plus 1 and
a sub n sub 1 plus 1.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And then I just keep doing this.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Since a sub 2 plus 1 equals
the supremum of the x of k,

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:54.970 align:middle line:84%
such that k is bigger than
or equal to n sub 2 plus 1,

00:59:54.970 --> 01:00:00.310 align:middle line:84%
there exists an n sub
3 bigger than n sub 2,

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:07.600 align:middle line:84%
such that a sub n sub 2
plus 1, minus now a third,

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.280 align:middle line:84%
is less than x sub n sub 3 is
less than or equal to a sub n

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.050 align:middle line:90%
sub 2 plus 1.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:24.330 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:24.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:32.350 align:middle line:90%


01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But now we're
essentially home free.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.835 align:middle line:84%
We'll just continue
in this manner.

01:00:36.835 --> 01:00:41.030 align:middle line:90%


01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me write down.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, strictly speaking, I
need to state the construction

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of this sequence as
an inductive argument,

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
but for the purposes
of this class,

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to say--
continuing in this manner.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And that will be what
I say for this part.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So continuing in this
manner, we obtain a sequence

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:40.245 align:middle line:90%
of integers, natural numbers--

01:01:40.245 --> 01:01:45.680 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.840 align:middle line:84%
n sub 1 less than n sub 2
less than n sub 3, so on--

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.190 align:middle line:90%
such that what holds--

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%


01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
such that, for all k
[? N, ?] natural number,

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:16.620 align:middle line:84%
a sub n sub k minus
1 plus 1 minus 1/k

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to x n sub k less than

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
or equal to a sub n
sub k minus 1 plus 1.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:30.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.430 align:middle line:90%


01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:38.035 align:middle line:84%
And here, if you like, we didn't
define what n sub 0 is, so--

01:02:38.035 --> 01:02:49.760 align:middle line:90%


01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
so really, we're only interested
in the n sub 1, n sub 2.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But for the sake of
this whole thing making

01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
sense for all integers k, with
n sub 0 being defined to be 0--

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:01.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
That's just the first
case that we dealt with.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So we obtain this
subsequence x sub n sub

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
k that's sandwiched in between
this subsequence of a's and

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
minus 1 over k,
and this sequence

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.270 align:middle line:90%
of a sub n sub k minus 1.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So since n sub 1 is less
than n sub 2 and so on,

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:36.435 align:middle line:90%
this implies that--

01:03:36.435 --> 01:03:46.040 align:middle line:90%


01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.770 align:middle line:84%
write it this way-- n plus 1 is
less than [INAUDIBLE] 2 plus 1

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:53.060 align:middle line:90%
is less than n sub 3 plus 1.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.760 align:middle line:90%
So this is a subsequence--

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.970 align:middle line:90%


01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:15.570 align:middle line:84%
a sub n sub k minus 1 plus 1
is a subsequence of a sub n's.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do we know" We
know the a sub n's converge

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:20.640 align:middle line:90%
to the limsup.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And we proved last time
that every subsequence

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of a convergent sequence
converges to the same thing.

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:31.800 align:middle line:90%


01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the limit as k goes
to infinity of a sub n sub

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
k minus 1 plus 1 equals the
limit of the original sequence,

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:45.750 align:middle line:84%
which is, by
definition, the limsup.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.500 align:middle line:90%


01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.880 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.360 align:middle line:90%
So now I have this subsequence.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So now I have this
subsequence of x's sandwiched

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.940 align:middle line:90%
in between two sequences--

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
this guy on the left,
this guy on the right.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
This guy on the right
converges to the limsup.

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
This guy on the left converges
to the limsup minus 0,

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.100 align:middle line:90%
because 1/k converges to 0.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:17.420 align:middle line:90%


01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze theorem,
we get that the limit as k

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of x sub n
sub k equals the limit as k

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:33.747 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of this
and this whole thing,

01:05:33.747 --> 01:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
which is the limsup.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:41.790 align:middle line:90%


01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:44.910 align:middle line:90%


01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, so I'll leave it
to you to do the liminf part.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
now, basically, this 1/k

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
gets moved to over here,
and this becomes a sub n sub

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:01.360 align:middle line:90%
k minus 1 plus 1 plus 1/k.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I just have this
on sitting below this guy.

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.320 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
That's really the only
change for the infs

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.395 align:middle line:84%
to get a subsequence
converging to the liminf.

01:06:11.395 --> 01:06:14.720 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've shown that there
exists a subsequence converging

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to the limsup and
the liminf, which

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
gives us the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.392 align:middle line:90%


01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And now let me come
back to the statement

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I made about these
two sequences here--

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
namely, that the limsup
equals the liminf if and only

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:49.530 align:middle line:84%
if the original
sequence converges.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:50.730 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove that now.

01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:59.830 align:middle line:90%


01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Let x sub n be a
bounded sequence.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:09.090 align:middle line:90%


01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Then xn converges if and only
if limsup equals the liminf.

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:26.120 align:middle line:90%


01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
And there's one more part.

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:30.910 align:middle line:90%


01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, if xn converges,
then all these limits agree--

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
equals the limsup,
equals liminf.

01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%


01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.620 align:middle line:90%


01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence
converges if and only

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
if the limsup
equals the liminf--

01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and in the case that we do have
this limit of the sequences

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.745 align:middle line:84%
given by this common value
of the limsup and liminf.

01:08:05.745 --> 01:08:14.240 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:22.859 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go
in one direction.

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
To do this direction, we'll
use the squeeze theorem.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So suppose L equals limsup x
sub n equals liminf of x sub n.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.990 align:middle line:84%
We're assuming that these
two things equal each other.

01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They're given by
a common value L.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to end up showing

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.540 align:middle line:84%
is that this sequence
converges to L.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.859 align:middle line:84%
So that actually gives the
second part of the statement

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:54.130 align:middle line:90%
of this theorem here.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:09:00.814 align:middle line:84%
So suppose L is this common
number, limsup and liminf.

01:09:00.814 --> 01:09:05.450 align:middle line:90%


01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Then, for all N,
[? a ?] natural number,

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
we have that the inf
of the x sub k's,

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
which is for k bigger
than or equal to n--

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:17.370 align:middle line:90%


01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
so x sub n is in this set,
so it's certainly bigger than

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.689 align:middle line:90%
or equal to this inf.

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's less than or equal
to the sup of that set,

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
again, because x sub
n sits in this set.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But as n goes to
infinity, this sequence

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
of numbers converges
to the liminf,

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
which is L. As n
goes to infinity,

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
this sequence of numbers
converges to the limsup, which

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is L. So by the squeeze
theorem, the thing in between,

01:09:52.930 --> 01:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
which is x sub n,
converges to L.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So for the second part, it's--

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:19.130 align:middle line:90%


01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:20.825 align:middle line:90%
follows from what we've proven--

01:10:20.825 --> 01:10:24.930 align:middle line:90%


01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
what we proved to obtain
the Bolzano-Weierstrass

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and what we know about
convergent sequences

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and their subsequences.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.724 align:middle line:90%


01:10:37.724 --> 01:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is for this
direction-- namely,

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that convergence implies the
limsup equals the liminf.

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%


01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Let L be the limit as n
goes to infinity of x sub n.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So now we're assuming that the
sequence converges to something

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:01.135 align:middle line:84%
which we call L-- doesn't
have to be the same L from--

01:11:01.135 --> 01:11:03.750 align:middle line:90%


01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
so it's just L I'm just
using for this limit.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%


01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
By previous theorem, there
exists a subsequence x sub n

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
sub k, such that
the limit as k goes

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to infinity of x sub n sub k
gives me limsup of x sub n.

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:40.240 align:middle line:90%


01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But this is a subsequence
of a convergent sequence,

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and a subsequence of
a convergent sequence

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is convergent, and
converges to the same thing.

01:11:53.210 --> 01:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So this thing on the left
is just equal to L. OK?

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:10.710 align:middle line:90%


01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, there exists a
subsequence x sub n sub k,

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
such that the limit as k goes
to infinity of x sub n sub

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:28.770 align:middle line:90%
k equals liminf of x sub n.

01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is a subsequence
of a convergent sequence,

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
so it's convergent and
convergence of the same thing,

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
L. So that implies that
this thing is equal to L.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.703 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the limsup and
the liminf equal each other,

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and they also equal the limit
of the original sequence.

01:12:55.340 --> 01:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So that is the end of the proof
of this theorem that the limsup

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and liminf--

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:12.650 align:middle line:84%
when they coincide and tell
you that the original sequence

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:13.320 align:middle line:90%
converges.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.695 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
way of thinking

01:13:14.695 --> 01:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
about limsups and
liminfs is that they also

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:22.850 align:middle line:84%
somehow measure just how
divergent your sequence is,

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
or at least the
difference between them.

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
If that difference is 0,
then your original sequence

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:28.380 align:middle line:90%
is convergent.

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:28.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.640 align:middle line:90%


01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I think
we'll stop there.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:42.241 align:middle line:90%

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.170
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to the last section of 8.20

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.190
Special Relativity.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.080
So as we discussed for special
relativity itself, also

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.300
general relativity
is a theory which

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.840
requires experimental
evidence to be confirmed.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.390
And there's plenty of
experimental evidence

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.590
for general relativity.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.380
We talked about a
few examples of them.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.540
But let's go through
this, one by one.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.330
Also, a little bit with
an historical context.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.120
So one of the first experimental
pieces of evidence pointed out

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.320
by Einstein was the
procession of mercury

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.570
and also of other planets.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.480
This was always this problem
that's a procession of mercury,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.310
deviates from
Newton's prediction

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.510
was well known and first
recognized already in 1859.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.883
And it turned out that attempts
to correct this failed.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:10.300
You can think
about, maybe there's

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.580
other objects in the
solar system which

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.810
modify the trajectory of
mercury around the sun.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.210
But nothing really
added up correctly.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.540
And then when
Einstein calculated

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.630
the effect of the
procession, he found

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.800
that it's in good agreement
with the observation.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.420
This was already
very strong evidence

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.260
for general relativity effects.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.030
And then there's
gravitational lensing.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.920
And here, this
was first measured

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.190
by Dyson and Eddington,
1919, of light

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.490
passing the sun in
a total eclipse.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.383
The observation was
in Brazil but also

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:47.550
at the West Coast of Africa.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.400
This wasn't the first
attempt to measure this.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.570
It was an eclipse, a total
eclipse in Argentina in 1912.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.580
But unfortunately,
this expedition

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.150
didn't lead to a result,
because it rained out.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.160
There was eclipse
shortly after in 1914,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.979
but that happened during
the Second World War,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.950
and there's long stories and
accounts of how this failed.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.370
But basically, one
of the expeditions

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.720
wanted to travel to
Crimea in Russia.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.180
And because Russia was
in war with Germany,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.640
material was confiscated,
and people were imprisoned.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.740
So this was canceled,
if you want,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.020
due to the second
and first World War.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.140
But then in 1919, this
led to the observation

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.270
the data was not as clear.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.360
I think there was a little
bit more hope than science

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.660
in the interpretation.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.850
So there was-- there was
not a strong evidence,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.800
a strong significance
of the results.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.050
But the evidence,
nevertheless, was there.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.790
And as I was explaining
earlier, that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.420
led to the fame or the
triumph of Einstein,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.660
where really, his
fame resulted out

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.535
of the reporting
of those events.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.130
There's more
experimental evidence.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.830
Light travel time
but around or close

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.330
to massive object is modified.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.930
We talked about gravitational
time dilation, which can be

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.550
measured or has been measured.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.930
Other tests of the equivalent
principle, but also

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.180
the observation of
gravitational waves.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.670
Gravitational waves were
predicted by Einstein

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.220
by the theory of
general relativity.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.490
And only very recently, we
were able to observe those.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.880
And then, in addition, there
is plenty cosmological tests,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.740
which require a
precise understanding

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.800
of general relativity
in order to get

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.070
to agreement between
the observations

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.590
and the theoretical predictions.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.780
But let's talk about--

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.710
let's talk about
gravitational waves.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.100
So those we predicted,
as I was saying,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.490
but they're very, very
difficult to measure.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.310
First, indirect measurement was
performed by Hulse and Taylor.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.210
They were able to study
binary neutron star system.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.100
And because the
orbits of those two

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.820
decayed required lots of
energy, and that lots of energy

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.290
needs to happen somehow.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.240
And it was theorized or
predicted by general relativity

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.460
that that loss of energy
is due to the fact

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.010
that gravitational
waves are emitted.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.660
And they received
for their findings

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.080
the Nobel Prize in
physics in 1993.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.960
So how are gravitational
waves generated?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.810
You can ask-- I have a
spinning sphere, like our sun.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.440
Would that generate
a gravitational wave?

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.370
The answer is no.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.560
It's a symmetrical situation.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.150
There's no change of
the metal distribution.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.180
And therefore, spacetime
is not modified.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.930
But if you have a sphere
with a little bump,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.090
that would create
gravitational waves.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.010
If you have a mass
which is moving by,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:14.170
maybe two passing galaxies,
that would not directly

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.690
create gravitational waves.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.900
But if you have those
galaxies rotating,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.750
or two stars rotating, or
neutron stars rotating,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.850
or black holes rotating
around each other,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.200
those generate
gravitational waves.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.760
And the closer the
object, the higher

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.920
the masses of the
objects, the stronger

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.820
the gravitational waves are.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.040
So how can you measure
gravitational waves?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.920
Very similar to the
Michael Smalley experiment.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.780
What you want to do
is measure differences

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.600
in arms of your interferometer.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.870
And you do this with
very powerful lasers

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.820
and with very precise mirrors.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.720
So it's very clear the very same
experiment as Michael Smalley,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.980
just much, much bigger.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.190
So we're talking about
multiple miles of arms

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.960
and very powerful
lasers in order

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.810
to conduct those experiments.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.690
LIGO, which is one
of those measurement,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.180
of those devices,
experiments, measures

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.630
the change in the length
of one arm with a precision

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.970
smaller than the
diameter of a proton.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.160
So that's just really--

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.470
it's mind-blowing, the
level of precision,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.170
the level of understanding
needed in order

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.790
to measure gravitational waves.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.000
But nevertheless,
they succeeded.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.853
So here, you see
two experiments.

00:06:36.853 --> 00:06:38.270
LIGO has actually
two experiments,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.180
two of those devices
in the United States.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.650
And there's other experiments
similar worldwide.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.100
You see also highlighted
here, Caltech and MIT.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.880
Those are the leading
communities of the leading

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.090
universities in this endeavor.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.400
And then the first observation
of gravitational waves

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.580
happened in September 14, 2015.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.510
And this first observation
was rather spectacular

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.120
because it was not
just any observation,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.570
but it was the observation of
two collapsing black holes.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.250
So you have two black holes.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.300
They get close to each other,
than they circle each other

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.410
and create a new,
heavier black hole.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.750
So the collision of
those two black holes

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.770
with masses around 30 times
the mass of the sun, it

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.260
actually took place
1.3 billion years ago.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.040
So the gravitational wave
was traveling towards us

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.350
for 1.3 billion years.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.470
The energy of about three
times the mass of the sun

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.240
was emitted as gravitational
waves in fractions of seconds.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.610
So the huge amount
of energy released

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.880
in form of gravitational waves.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.190
The collision happens with
both black holes moving

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.730
with half the speed of light.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:06.050
So this is just a catastrophic
kind of event, in our universe.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.510
And researchers or
faculty at MIT and Caltech

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.150
received the Nobel
Prize in physics in 2017

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.790
for this discovery, only two
years after the discovery

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.260
actually happened--

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.685
and very deserved,
very deserved.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.470
Let me close this lecture
by just reminding you

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.710
of a quote of Einstein,
which I use in order to start

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.320
this very same lecture.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.740
It is true that we are living
through some difficult times,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.450
some turbulent times.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.850
But if you think about
the bigger picture,

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.550
I think we're making
a lot of progress

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.160
scientifically but
also as humanity.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.790
And I like this quote from
Albert Einstein a lot.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.020
"It is not the result
of scientific research

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.200
that ennobles humans and
enriches their nature,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.970
but it's the struggle
to understand

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.410
while performing creative and
open-minded intellectual work."

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.240
I think if there's
one thing I want

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.090
you to take away from this
lecture, it is this quote.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.440
I want you to be encouraged to
be creative, to be open-minded,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.210
to question, and to perform
high-level intellectual work.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.030
Thank you.

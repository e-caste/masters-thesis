00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.160
NICOLA MARZARI: As you have
heard that this is actually

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.210
the last class for the course,
it will be a split lecture.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.770
I'll start for half an hour.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.740
Then Professor Ceder
will continue and wrap up

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.680
the course, and
then at the end, I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.700
will also spend 15 minutes
doing course evaluations.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.550
So we'll just leave you here
with the forms and filling up.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.730
On my side here, I
think I'll end up

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.530
discussing a topic that's
actually very dear to me.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.720
I think it's been a very
intriguing and very fruitful

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.160
application of modeling
and, in particular,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.870
modeling based on quantum
mechanical energy schemes

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.200
to an interesting set
of scientific problems.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.120
We have said it
over and over again.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570
A set of simulations
allow you to do

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.510
sort of computational
experiments

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.160
in areas where maybe things are
happening too fast to follow

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.920
them with real
experiments, or maybe they

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.950
happen on time scales--

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.550
sorry, on length scales that
are too small to really follow.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.130
Or as in this case,
they take place

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.410
under certain
thermodynamic conditions

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.940
that are very difficult or
even impossible to reproduce

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.580
with an experimental apparatus.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
Let's look, actually,
at the first case,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.270
and this is research
which a lot of work

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.850
has been done at University
College in London

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.530
by Dario Alfe and Mike Gillan.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.240
So this is actually a cut
out of the Earth interior,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.910
and in case you're not familiar
with this, the way it works

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.200
is that we are actually sitting
on a large liquid region.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.160
So you see, on top here, we
have sort of the Earth crust.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.210
And what is very important
for us is actually

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.780
this region, dark
yellow and light yellow,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.470
in which we have the so-called
core of the planet that

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.640
is mainly constituted by iron.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.450
Iron actually is a
very stable nucleus.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.840
So instead of the early
formation of stars,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.040
it's one of the elements
that sort of, once created,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.530
sort of was more
stable than the other.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.140
And what happens
in our planet is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.830
that we have a sort of
increasing pressure going

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.100
inside, and the inner
core, so-called,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.180
again, sort of mostly
iron is actually solid.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.220
And we know very well
what is the pressure here

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.190
at the boundary between the
outer core and the inner core.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.780
This part is liquid.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.450
Pressure is increasing here.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.960
So this part is liquid.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.400
This part is solid.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.810
It's mostly iron.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.090
And for this sort of
case, we'll assume

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.580
that is 100% iron,
although there

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.940
is another problem of
really how much impurities

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.050
they are diluted.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.520
And we know very well what
is the pressure there,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.460
because we can sort of
look at seismic waves

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.880
and how seismic
waves get deflected

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.560
by that discontinuities.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.790
And the pressure is
roughly 330 gigapascal,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.500
but we actually don't know what
is the phase diagram of iron

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.370
at that pressure.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.280
And you see, if we knew what
the phase diagram of iron

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.270
at that pressure was, we
could pinpoint exactly

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.910
the temperature here,
because these points here

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.980
are sort of points
of coexistence

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.040
at 330 gigapascal
between the liquid

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.600
and the solid phase
at that boundary.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.690
So if you want, by
knowing the pressure,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.260
we would be able via the
phase diagram of iron

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.300
to actually pinpoint what is the
temperature inside the Earth.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.270
And before sort of the set of
experimental and theoretical

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.660
work that I'll show, the
estimates, actually, for this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.610
were really sort of ranging
in a very wide spectrum

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.900
of possibilities from 3,000
Kelvin to 8,000 Kelvin.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.330
And this is where sort of
our initial simulations

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.940
become very useful,
because really,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.070
once you believe your energy
model, there is no reason

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.332
to sort of think
that it would fail,

00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:17.999
either because the
pressure is too large

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:23.040
or because the
temperature is too high.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.500
In all of this current
experimental capabilities

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.860
to study the high
pressure system,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.550
the best instrument is what is
called a diamond anvil cell.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.310
That is basically
made by 2 diamonds.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.000
So the more perfect they
are, the better that they

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.390
squeeze whatever
you're putting inside.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.370
And you know diamond
is transparent to a lot

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.860
of wavelengths, so they are
very useful to probe them

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.630
with spectroscopic techniques.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.940
But basically, now,
the best you can do--

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.300
and you still sort
of break up hundreds

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.810
of diamonds in the process--

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.410
is that you can get
to 300 gigapascal

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.550
if you are doing this
at room temperature.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.960
But as soon as you want to study
things at a higher temperature,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.650
really 200 gigapascal is the
limit that you can reach.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.110
Well, we want to figure
out what's happening here.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.500
There are other techniques--
experimental techniques

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.740
to study matter under conditions
of very high pressure and very

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.300
high temperatures done with
what is called a gunshot

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.090
cannon in which you really
sort of shoot pellets

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.670
and try to establish
what's going

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.000
on in the instant in which
they hit their target.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.670
And so they find themselves
at very high condition

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.170
of pressure, but
it's very difficult

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.540
to get accurate
data out of this.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.300
And so we'll see
here actually sort

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.180
of how ab initio simulation
and, in particular,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.020
thermodynamic integration has
been used to figure out what

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.930
is going on in this region--

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.620
in this region here.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.430
And as usual, you
need to make sure

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.070
that you believe
your energy model.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.800
So these are a couple
of validation curves.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.710
This is for an HCP iron.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.520
That is one of the
high pressure phases,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.680
and the comparison between the
sort of experimental results

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.450
and simulation
where the simulation

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.890
are the sort of solid lines.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.410
And you see it agrees
very well in describing

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.840
the equation of state, pressure
versus volume in this case.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.800
And then in particular,
this is a calculation

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.120
of the phonon modes of
the vibrational frequency.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.950
This is something
that actually you

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.800
could very easily do with
the quantum mechanical tools

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.440
that you have done as a
sort of post-processing

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.070
of your laboratory three,
but again, it works.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.760
It works.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.910
It works very well.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.420
So once you believe
iron, now the issue

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.940
is trying to figure out what
is its phase diagram at, say,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.250
which temperature
you have coexistence

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.050
between the solid
and the liquid.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.320
And you have actually done
this in your laboratory

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.640
for a sort of explicit method
to find out the transition

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.850
temperature by just doing
a simulation of a liquid

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.900
and a solid phase, and figuring
out at which temperature

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.640
the boundary between
the two phases

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.810
doesn't really grow
into each other.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.360
So the solid doesn't
keep growing,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.610
or the liquid
doesn't keep growing.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.860
And you see an example of
this in sort of what follows.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.680
The caveat that in doing
this kind of simulation

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.610
is that they are still sort of
very expensive to do ab initio.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.090
You usually need at
least 400 or 500 atoms

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.070
to do such kind of
simulation and sort

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.440
of to kill the
final size effects.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.320
And this is, even
now, borderline

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.850
for what we can do even
for the simplest elements.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.970
There is another approach that
I wanted to introduce first,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.880
and this is the one in which
we actually sort of determine

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.010
explicitly the
Gibbs free energy.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.030
So in this case, what
you want to find out

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.120
is thermodynamic stability
at a given pressure

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.780
and at a given temperature.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.100
So the Gibbs free energy is
your correct thermodynamic

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.220
potential.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.160
And so your goal,
if you want, is

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.520
being able to calculate
the Gibbs free energy

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.520
of your solid system as
a function of temperature

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.610
and the Gibbs free energy
of your liquid system.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.210
And of course, the point where
these two free energy cross

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.670
is really your
coexistence point.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.000
Above that critical
temperature, the liquid phase

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.440
is more stable.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.230
And below that critical
temperature, the solid--

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.570
that solid phase is more stable.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.070
And sort of one possible way
of calculating, actually,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.360
explicitly this free
energy or, in particular,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.270
calculating the free energy
difference with respect

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.570
to a known phase is to use
thermodynamic integration.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.810
That is a technique that
sort of has been discussed

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.300
in some of the previous
lecture by Professor Ceder,

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.990
so I've just put
up a reminder here.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.400
And the nomenclature is
that we are using, actually,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.190
a Hamiltonian or an
energy model that

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.040
depends on a parameter lambda.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.280
And the parameter lambda
is something that, say,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.910
brings us from the solid to the
liquid, because ultimately what

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.670
we want to sort of
figure out is, what

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.190
is the difference in
Gibbs free energy,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.040
say, between the
liquid and the solid,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.860
or maybe between two solids,
between one reference

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.900
phase of the solid and another
reference phase of the solid?

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.870
And again, the idea behind
thermodynamic integration

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.260
is fairly simple once you
skip all the math here.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.790
Again, one can write out
explicitly the partition,

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.520
or the partition
function is written here.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.240
And then it just requires
a little bit of math,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.570
sort of figuring out
that the derivative

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.210
of the, in this case,
Gibbs free energy--

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.850
well, sorry, this is
actually a constant volume.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.970
So it would be a sort of
[? isentropic ?] simulation.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.820
No, sorry.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.180
It would be constant
volume, constant temperature

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.140
simulation.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.600
So [INAUDIBLE] energy.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.820
So the derivative
of the free energy

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.200
with respect to this
parameter lambda--

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.470
you see once you sort make the
appropriate substitution-- that

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.060
is, you put the logarithm
of the partition function,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.950
and you work out
explicitly what is

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.990
that logarithm of the
partition function in there,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.225
you have 1 over q times the q
over the lambda, and 1 over q

00:10:36.225 --> 00:10:38.220
is the partition function here.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.830
And this is the derivative
of the partition function

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.910
with respect lambda.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.480
You basically get
an expression that

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.210
is nothing else than the average
in your ensemble normalized

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.000
by the partition function
of the u over the lambda.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.620
So in order to calculate
what is the derivative

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.740
of the free energy
with respect to lambda,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.000
you need to calculate what
is the thermodynamic average

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.360
in your ensemble of the
derivative of the energy

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.640
with respect to lambda.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.900
And so this is a quantity
that you can always calculate,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.860
and this is just an
average over your ensemble.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.050
So let's look at
sort of how this

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.150
is done in a specific case.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.100
So again, I just returned
here the partition function,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.720
the logarithm--

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.390
the free energy, sorry, as
the logarithm of the partition

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.620
function.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.620
u will be our internal
energy, and this

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.090
is what you calculate with
your quantum mechanical model.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.330
And for simplicity,
I've actually

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.050
broken this in three
parts, and that is I've

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:55.180
written out what is the
energy at the equilibrium

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.920
and then the energy for
any possible configuration

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.040
of the ions can be
written as the energy

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.900
at equilibrium plus what is
called the harmonic term.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.310
So when you expand the energy
of a system around equilibrium,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.200
the first derivatives
are 0 by definition.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.310
And so here you have
the quadratic terms

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.650
in the displacement
of the position

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.210
around that
equilibrium position.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.780
And then you have all
the nonlinear term that

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.360
will call sort of anharmonic.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.510
And it's actually, say,
in the case of a solid,

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.920
this makes a lot of
sense, because it's

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.500
sort of fairly easy to
calculate explicitly

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.780
the integral of the partition
function for this term

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.870
in the overall energy function.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.670
And then this sort
of is reserved

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.860
for an explicit integration
than using molecular dynamics.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.580
And because basically you have
a logarithm of an exponential,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.310
if you sort of break
out of this thing

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.360
in the sum of different
terms, all the terms that

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.060
contribute separate free energy
pieces to your overall system.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.500
And so we could
calculate, let's say,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.410
for a solid system what is
the additional vibrational--

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.210
in this case, free energy--

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.510
that comes on top of the
equilibrium ground state

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.040
energy, and coming just
from the harmonic term.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.090
And I haven't worked out
the algebra explicitly,

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.480
but it's actually fairly
easy to do these integrals

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:43.540
by writing the harmonic term in
terms of the interatomic force

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.590
constants.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:50.380
So if you sort of figure out
with electronic structure

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.070
codes what are the normal
modes of your system--

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.580
that is, what are the
modes that give you

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.240
an expression for the
harmonic term that

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.610
is diagonal in the
displacement-- and you find out

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.650
the frequencies,
well, you can actually

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.720
substitute that expression in
here, work out the integral,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.820
and basically what you obtain is
that your harmonic vibrational

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:24.700
free energy is just given by a
sum over the logarithm of all

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.470
your vibrational frequency.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.890
So this omega here would
be your phonon frequency

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.850
if you go back to what
we had seen before

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:40.450
for the case of iron when we
have calculated the phonon

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.140
spectrum.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.250
Here it is.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:47.680
So here, what we have calculated
is all the possible frequency

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.860
for iron, depending
on the wave vector.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.520
So in principle, we have
a continuum of frequency,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.300
and we just need to basically
integrate these curves

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.040
or sum over our course
representation of them

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.440
to get the vibrational
free energy--

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.810
at least the harmonic term.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.740
And this is it.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.500
And so this is sort
of the first step.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.050
This can give me, say,
what is the change

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.770
in the vibrational
free energy in going,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.570
say, from one
phase to the other.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.960
And I just calculate
the phonon frequency

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.020
in sort of two different phases.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.250
What is more intriguing
is the calculation

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.340
of all the nonlinear
terms that can be very

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.210
important at high temperature.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.780
And this is sort of the
slightly more difficult task,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.190
because especially in a
sort of ab initio framework,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:51.930
it requires very
extensive integration

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.910
of your thermodynamic ensemble.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.330
So you would do something like
molecular dynamic simulations

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.700
or Monte Carlo
simulation to sample

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.470
as much as possible a set of
representative microstates,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.020
but it tends to
be very expensive.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.920
So there is actually
sort of a very useful,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.920
if you want trick that is often
used in order to calculate

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.540
this anharmonic term, that
remember the anharmonic term is

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.070
nothing else than the overall
vibration of free energy

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.620
minus the harmonic term.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.800
And the trick are consistently
used in introducing a reference

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:41.220
classical potential so that a
lot of your expensive sampling

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.420
of the phase space can be done
with classical simulations

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.900
and a very expansive ab
initio simulation are only

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.530
used to figure out what
is the sort of difference

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.250
in thermodynamical terms
between your quantum

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.960
potential and your
classical potential.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.810
So again, sort of just
a mathematical term.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:09.510
I mean, we can sort of
think at our overall energy.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.200
So this would be the
overall, apart from this sort

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.829
of equilibrium term.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.310
So what we are
trying to calculate

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.190
is the difference
between the whole term

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.859
minus the harmonic
term, but we actually

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.609
introduce a classical potential
that sort of hopefully

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.640
reproduces as
closely as possible

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.900
the energies, the interactions
between all our atoms.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.610
And so we can actually break
down this term in two parts--

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.560
one that has to do
with the difference

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.050
between the harmonic crystal
and the reference system,

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.660
and one that has to do with
the difference between sort

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.700
of our overall energy term
here, or the overall free energy

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.870
term, including non-linear
fx minus their reference--

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.610
minus the reference system.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.360
And now, this here
is a calculation

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.560
that involves only sort of
classical potential calculation

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.910
of your phonon frequency.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.720
So this can be done
very extensively

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.750
over longer classical
simulation, and in a way,

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.830
it captures all the
complexity of the phase space.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.660
While this, that
is very expensive,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.140
because you need to calculate
the internal energy with sort

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.720
of the quantum
mechanical model--

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.320
is sort of you are
trying to sample

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.500
the difference between
two quantities that

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.870
are as similar as possible.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.770
And in the ideal case in
which your classical potential

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.160
is able actually to reproduce
your quantum potential,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.140
this goes towards 0.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.780
So it's something that is
very simple to integrate.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.030
So by introducing basically
a reference potential,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.780
you are shifting a lot of
the thermodynamic integration

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.520
to the classical simulation.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.030
And you are just using the
quantum mechanical simulations

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.680
to sort of sample
the difference.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.170
And so this can
be done, actually,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.520
with much shorter and
much smaller simulations.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.220
And I want to go actually into
the details of what you need

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.270
to do for the case of iron that
is what is a good potential,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.480
but people have figured out
that something as simple

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.440
as basically a sort
of Lennard-Jones

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.600
just like kind of potential
on top of anharmonic term

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.980
is actually good enough to
provide a reference potential.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.090
So basically with
all this formalism,

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.490
what one is able
to do at the end

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.570
is calculate the free
energy differences in which,

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.710
if you want the fundamental
components are calculating

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.740
the phonon frequency
of your system--

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.190
in this case, specifically
for the case of a solid--

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.250
that gives you the first step
in the vibrational free energy.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.400
And if nothing else, then
this case, a density function

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.080
or perturbational
theory calculation.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.060
You want the phonon
spectrum, and then you

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.750
need to do a number of
molecular dynamic simulations

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.050
on very large and
sort of very extensive

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.670
for classical potential.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.400
And then if you want,
you just correct

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.710
your classical simulations
with the difference

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.370
between the classical and
the quantum potential.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.460
And once you have
all of data, you

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.780
are basically able to calculate
all sort of the free energies

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.840
that you need.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.840
And I guess this is an example.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.510
I'll show in a moment
a more telling example

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.720
in which, again, sort
of we compare actually

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.020
sort of what our prediction
are for the pressure,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.040
volume, curve coming from
the ab initio simulation

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.840
and experimental results.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.060
But more importantly,
if you want,

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.190
we are actually
able to figure out

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.290
when the free
energy of the solid

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:49.020
and the free energy
of the liquid cross.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.840
And we can do this as
a function of pressure.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.990
And so this is, at this
stage, our best prediction

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:02.310
for the phase diagram of iron
as a function of pressure.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.920
In particular, the
black line here

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.820
is sort of the set of
simulation that I've described.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.220
And there starts to be
a reasonable agreement

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.950
between a number of
Shockley-Gunn experiments

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.120
and a number of simulation that
puts roughly the temperature

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.770
at 330 gigapascal, just
sort of above 6,000 Kelvin.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.630
And so this was--

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.390
when it came out, the
scientific literature,

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.660
it was sort of hailed as
taking the temperature

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.280
of the core of the Earth.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.840
And at this stage,
it's, again, sort

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.840
of our most accurate prediction
of what is going on inside.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.640
Just sort of to make the point
that this is not the only way,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.790
remember that one can
also do the simulation

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.830
of the coexistence
between the solid

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:55.560
and the liquid exactly as you
have done in your laboratory,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.300
in your lab number four.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.050
This is actually a paper,
again, sort of Science 2000,

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.340
really sort of state
of the art research.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.550
And in these
particular simulations,

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.730
they used classical potential.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.050
So again, not very
far from what you

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:16.010
have done with the only caveat
that the classical potential

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.460
had been extensively
optimized to describe

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.650
solid and liquid iron.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.960
And the way that
optimization was done,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.420
it used what is called
a force matching

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.660
method, in which
basically you do, again,

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.400
extensive but small ab initio
molecular dynamic simulation.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.760
And you sort of tune
your classical potential

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.340
in order to have
this more or less

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.160
the mean square
error with respect

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.050
to the ab initio simulation.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.180
And that often, because
you have basically so

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.060
many configurations,
and so you sample

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.180
so many possible different
environments for your atoms,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.660
it can somehow give
you a reasonably robust

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.130
classical potentials, again,
in sort of very simple cases.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.860
This case is just
an elemental system,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:12.420
and sort of in a range of
temperature and pressure.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.720
So this was sort of
an example that I

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.500
wanted to discuss a
little bit more in detail.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.370
I think all this sort of
research area of studying

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.460
the properties of matter
at extreme condition

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.910
has been extremely fruitful from
the point of view of ab initio

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.170
simulations.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.350
And sort of there
are other cases

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:39.260
in which actually the phase
diagram of, say, methane

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.630
under high pressure
has sort of led

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.790
to a number of
interesting discoveries.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.880
There are all the planets--

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.820
Jupiter and beyond often are
made by a mixture of methane,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.290
water, or often, say,
in the case of Jupiter,

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.080
a large amount of hydrogen.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.810
And the phase diagram of this
system, again, at very high

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.150
pressure is largely unknown.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.430
One of the most interesting
sort of prediction

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.970
that was made already
in the '30s by Wigner

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:16.120
was that hydrogen,
under high pressure,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.130
should really start to behave
as all the other alkali metals

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.060
in the first group.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.500
If you think
hydrogen is in there,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.090
and there's a sort of molecular
gas at ambient condition,

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.190
but everything below it--

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.560
it's really a simple metal--

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.140
lithium, sodium, potassium,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.640
And at ambient condition,
hydrogen, if you want,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.890
would belong much
more to group seven

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.740
with the halogens
that really form

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.960
dimer and gases, like a chlorine
or bromine, than on group one.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.240
But if you keep
compressing, compressing,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.110
there should be a point in
which it becomes metallic.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.960
And we haven't really
reached the state.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.480
There are indications from
the shotgun experiments

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.970
that it could reach the metallic
state at 350, 400 gigapascal,

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.010
but this is extremely
important, because, say,

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.410
for a planet like
Jupiter, there is

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.330
a huge difference
if we are going

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.890
to have in the inside of the
planet, say, a molecular solid,

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.130
or a metallic solid,
or a metallic fluid.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.610
If we have a hydrogen that
all of a sudden inside

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.480
is a metallic fluid,
well, we can have there

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.990
right away, like for the case
of Earth, a significant source

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.980
of magnetic field if we start
to have a sort of circulation

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.090
in that fluid.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.310
So all of this is
very important,

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.380
and I think one of the most
intriguing prediction that

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.270
actually sort of
had originally come

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:50.860
just as a hypothesis
by Martin Ross in 1981

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.290
was that, in some
of this planet,

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.100
there could be an interesting
decomposition of methane.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.440
So basically, what
could be going on

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.200
is that inside, say, Neptune,
as you increase the pressure,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.760
your methane molecule under
the effective pressure

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.250
starts decomposing.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.340
And this actually
has been seen in

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.560
quantum mechanical simulations.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.410
And so what you have
is that-- on one side

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.620
is that the carbon atoms--
and you have a breaking

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.670
of the carbon-hydrogen bond.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:31.150
And so you have formation
of pure carbon, of diamonds,

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.480
and you have formation
of higher hydrocarbons.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.950
And actually, there
has always been

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.260
a sort of experimental
observation

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.950
of an anomalous presence
of high order hydrocarbons

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.000
on the surface of this planet.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.330
And so this simulation
for the first time

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.760
provided a reason
why there should

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.400
be higher order hydrocarbons.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.330
They are basically created
when methane collapses

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.500
under pressure, and then somehow
from deep inside the planet,

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.570
these sort of
convective currents

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.910
bring these hydrocarbons up.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.520
But the other prediction
that, I think,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.820
even if not confirmed at the
time is the most appealing,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.330
is that at the same time you
have nucleation of diamond,

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.990
and so there is this beautiful
picture of basically a rain

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:20.770
of diamonds taking
place inside the planet

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.320
and basically converging
to the inside.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.980
And again, this was
just a prediction,

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.680
but I think in 2002 or 2003--
maybe it's mentioned here.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:38.530
No, 1999, so just two or three
years after the previous paper,

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.950
finally there were sort of
diamond anvil cell experiments

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.970
made by Raymond
Jeanloz at Berkeley.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.410
And all of a sudden, methane
under pressure sort of

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.110
gave rise both to
higher hydrocarbons,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.740
but also to the clear
signature of diamonds.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.650
So they saw basically the
nucleation of pure diamonds

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:04.180
just under pressure, and I
guess this brought in general,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.470
both in the geophysical and in
the planetary community, a lot

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.400
of resonance for the importance
of this ab initio simulation

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.690
in the field.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.410
And the last example
that I wanted

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.280
to show in terms of sort
of geophysical or planetary

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.070
importance is actually
the one of water

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:28.540
that, as a very intriguing
phase that was sort of

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.750
suggested for the first
time, again, in 1999--

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.510
and what I'm showing here is
just a network of solid oxygen.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.510
So here I'm just showing the
oxygen for a high pressure

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.200
phase.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.540
In this simulation,
we were looking

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.660
at 20 gigapascal of pressure.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.180
And what happens is
that, if you increase

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.060
the temperature
enough, actually water

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.720
becomes superprotonic--
that is a very exotic phase.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.380
So the covalent bonds
between hydrogen and oxygen

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.000
breaks apart, and the
system is still a solid.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.180
Again, high pressure even if
there is high temperature,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.920
but the hydrogens start
moving around like a liquid.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.350
So you have a
coexistence of phases

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.200
between a solid phase
of one sublattice

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.560
and the other sublattice
that has gone liquid.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.360
There are a number
of sort of materials

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.180
that, even at ordinary
conditions, do this.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.380
There are some salts silver
iodide that does this,

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.830
and there are interesting
fuel cell materials

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.570
that do this, because,
again, in this case,

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.710
say, when you have a
superprotonic, in this case,

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.770
phase-- that is, when you
have that the protons behave

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.320
as a liquid-- well this
system becomes a very

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.900
intriguing ionic conductor.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.090
But again, this was a
prediction from 1999.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.330
And actually, just
a few weeks ago

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.820
came the experimental
confirmation

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.750
from Lawrence Livermore,
and lo and behold,

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.970
the superprotonic phase
of water has been found.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.030
It has been found that 47
gigapascal instead of 20

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.260
gigapascal as usual,
I mean, because of all

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.230
the errors involved in
density function theory,

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.900
and in this specific case,
also, the the errors involved

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.780
with the sort of quantum
mechanical description

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.300
of the vibrational
excitation that, remember,

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.790
is a Bose-Einstein gas.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:26.110
And I'll conclude
with the last slide

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.950
that, again, it's not any
more geophysical or planetary,

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.810
but is, again, another very
intriguing example of what

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.160
was discovered in the
high pressure regime.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.060
And this is, again, some
work from the late '90s that

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.560
has to do, actually, with
the behavior of alkali,

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.520
like sodium or lithium
under pressure.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.650
These are metals that we really
sort of describe and consider--

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.340
simple metals, where
the valence electron

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.750
behave as almost nearly
free electron gas.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.670
Think at lithium for a moment.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.330
You have a core with two
electron in the 1s orbital,

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.930
and then you have a single
electron on the 2s orbital that

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.910
becomes very delocalized.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.630
And now this is what was
discovered that, I think,

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.020
it was very appealing.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.720
And at some level,
it was also confirmed

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.330
recently by the
Carnegie group that does

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.640
a lot of these high
pressure experiments,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.930
but basically, when you start
compressing your system, what

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.560
you have is that the
2s electrons start

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.100
overlapping more and more.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.800
If you want that
very high pressure,

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.990
even the core of your lithium
atoms start overlapping.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.410
And what's happening
is that Pauli principle

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.270
becomes exceedingly relevant.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.560
That is, you start to
have 2s electrons that,

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.590
by pressure, would be forced to
be almost in the same quantum

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.090
state.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.000
They start to overlap
very significantly.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.780
And what happens is that,
in order to escape this,

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.270
the electrons
actually self localize

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.190
in the interstitial position.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.970
So the 2s electrons, from sort
of being around the lithium

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.170
atom, sort of moves
around and jumps

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.090
into the interstitial position.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:23.040
It localizes, and it actually
pairs with another electron.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.250
So you have that your unit
cell becomes double or sort of

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.720
becomes more complex.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.260
And actually, your system
is a phase transition

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:37.090
from the metallic case of the
sort of ordinary simple metals

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.850
to an insulating case
in which, actually,

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.230
really a pair of electrons
localize in the interstitials.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.980
And again, these are actually
sort of cutting edge research

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.160
that one nowadays can
do on a simple computer,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.090
because studying something
like the equation of state

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:59.500
of a simple metal in a variety
of [INAUDIBLE] lattices

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.070
and a variety of
crystallographic incarnation

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.990
is actually very simple to do.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.490
It's nothing different
from what you

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.910
have done for, say, silicon
or the semiconductors

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.040
in your first laboratory.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.170
With this, I'll
conclude my part,

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.630
and Professor Ceder
will continue from here.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.480
And again, as a
summary, just wanted

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:24.100
to give you an example of our
whole line of research that

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.810
has come out from modeling
and very accurate modeling,

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:33.407
and really going in directions
where experiments would be--

00:33:33.407 --> 00:33:38.410
or still are exceedingly
difficult, or even impossible

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.570
to do.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:44.710
And with this, I'll switch
on to the next lecture.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.630
Let me--

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:49.570
GERBRAND CEDER: So let me hammer
in again the sort of overview,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.260
the kind of guideline by
which we set up the course.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.590
I think by now hopefully
you'll see the structure.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.120
We covered energy methods.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.940
We covered simulation
methods, and then

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.810
the last third of
the course was really

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:07.390
a kind of showing you how
these are combined together,

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.280
and that's often still
a very hard part,

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:16.070
how you combine all these things
to make impact on something.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.830
And this is-- being
at MIT, impact

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.550
is the one thing we
worry a lot about.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.610
And if you see the
kind of things that--

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.810
to integrate modeling more
with materials research,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.639
there are really these
four poles that you need.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.030
There's obviously
method development,

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.739
and we told you
a lot about that.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.510
We told you what
goes into DFT, what

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:43.120
goes into molecular
dynamics, Monte Carlo,

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.010
there's an important
factor of dissemination,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.469
which is getting better
and better done, I think,

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:49.250
in modeling.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.800
There's now a lot of stuff
where you really just

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.929
can fairly easily
get access to codes.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.230
You get quantum codes, good MD
codes-- sometimes for money,

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.240
but in many cases, for free.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.280
And then there's, of
course, the education part,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.380
which we try to address here.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.780
This is actually a picture from
last year, or two years ago.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.330
I actually think I have one
from longer ago where, see,

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.572
Professor Marzari still has
a beard, which is how you

00:35:18.572 --> 00:35:19.780
know how old that picture is.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.327
But anyway, but I think,
then, the fourth pole

00:35:23.327 --> 00:35:24.660
is the one you shouldn't forget.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.000
You think that for modeling
you only need modeling,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.280
but I think what you need more
sometimes than modeling is

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.140
the basic signs of your field.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.920
I think, without understanding
the field in which you work--

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.960
the theory, the
material science of it--

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.370
there's really
very little impact

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.912
you can do with
modeling, because you

00:35:45.912 --> 00:35:48.780
can be a good modeler, but if
you don't know what to model,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.730
you're never going
to have impact,

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.880
unless you choose to remain
on the pure theory and method

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.030
development side.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:59.000
But I would argue that, even
then, you need to understand.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.500
You have to have field specific
knowledge, because otherwise

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.220
you never know what is going
to be important to develop.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.740
So I sort of hope you
don't forget that.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.970
So this being the
end of the course,

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:20.230
I'll give you a few more maybe
sort of loaded perspective--

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.740
personal perspectives on
the field, and what's good,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.500
and what are the potential
directions about it.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.330
This is what people
want from you.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.190
They want properties.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.230
They want behavior.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.900
And this is where you
essentially start,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.630
and typically you see people
draw these kind of slides

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.370
of the multi scale perspective.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.940
You go from atoms to
microstructure to continuum.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.720
This is essentially--
has almost never worked.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.830
This is great for raising money.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.030
It's a great sort of cartoon
view grab of what you do.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.720
It's rarely that you
actually ever do this.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.120
There are very few
properties where you make it

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.760
across all the length scales.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:12.000
And so what you really do is you
kind of connect at some level.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.880
You sort of connect
these through your brain.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.670
In many cases,
there are properties

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:21.140
we determine just by doing
stuff at the electronic level.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.110
And we don't barter
coarse-graining that explicitly

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.407
through the length scales.

00:37:25.407 --> 00:37:26.990
And what you're
really doing is you're

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.840
using your basic materials
theory knowledge-- for example,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.530
that maybe when you work
on color of materials.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.380
I mean, I had this one--
jewelers once came to me

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.690
and asked if I
could predict color

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:47.090
for gemstones and for thin
layer-- thin surface layers

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.050
that they could use to coat.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:52.540
So in many cases, those are
fairly local properties,

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.510
especially in oxides.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.720
So there you sort of decide
yourself, gee, there's

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.910
kind of one length
scale that's important--

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.310
this one-- and I'm going to
directly calculate my property.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.520
So this is you.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.010
This is, I think, why your
field specific knowledge is,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:13.810
in some sense, more important
than all these multi scale

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.560
techniques.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.830
This is my pet topic that--

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.750
it may seem obvious
that you can--

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.310
an obvious goal to try
to simulate all the way

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.120
from electrons to properties
by coarse-graining the length

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.650
scale.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.670
But you have so much more
impact if you just substitute

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.670
that idea by knowledge.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.260
I think, if all
the money had been

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.410
spent on trying to integrate
length scale had been spent

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.810
on actually trying to
integrate materials

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.950
modeling with material science
by connecting your field

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.020
specific knowledge, by trying
to figure out what to compute,

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:57.720
which is often the hard part,
we'd actually done much better.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:03.570
So I'm going to give you an
example, which I really like.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.580
It's not my work.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.040
It's done by people
at Northwestern.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.505
It's on intergranular
embrittlement of iron.

00:39:10.505 --> 00:39:12.130
And this is sort of
one of these things

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.350
that you really think
you need a multi scale

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.700
sort of big kind of
modeling approach on.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.590
Essentially, the
observation is that there's

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.740
quite a few impurities in
steel that embrittle steel,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:28.220
and there's some that actually
enhance the internal cohesion.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.120
Sort of the typical
examples are phosphorous,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.110
which is really bad.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.780
Phosphorus is a really bad
embrittler of high strength

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.910
steel, whereas boron tends to
enhance intergranular cohesion.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.650
So when you sort of hear
about this for the first time,

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.750
you think, well, how am
I going to study this?

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.340
Maybe I'll set up a big
simulation with a grain

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.920
boundary in, and I'll
put phosphorus there,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.770
or I'll put born there, and
I'll try to pull it apart.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:57.190
And that'd sort of be
the brute force, maybe

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.360
multiscale approach.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.550
You could embed that
in a continuum theory,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.910
but there's a sort
of very simpler--

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.920
a very basic theory
that tells you there's

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.970
a much simpler way
to understand this.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.810
And that's the Rice-Wang
theory, which essentially

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:14.770
states that the embrittling
tendency of a solute

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.170
depends on the
difference in segregation

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.110
energy between the segregation
energy for that element

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:23.810
to a grain boundary
and to a free surface.

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.150
And you can sort of
intuitively-- this is actually

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.420
mathematically justified.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.060
It's actually a quite
elaborate theory

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.750
that you can catch
in two sentences,

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.020
but you can sort of see why this
is true from a driving force

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.340
perspective.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.670
If you have an impurity
that has a large segregation

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.390
energy to a surface rather
than a grain boundary,

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:47.588
then its presence is
going to enhance surfaces,

00:40:47.588 --> 00:40:49.130
because then it can
have that benefit

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.230
from that large
segregation energy.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.430
So those are going to be
embrittlers, because they will

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.650
tend to promote decohesion.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.060
Whereas the ones that have
a very large segregation

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.870
energy at the grain boundary,
rather than the free surface,

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:06.210
will tend to promote cohesion.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.270
And so if you believe
Rice-Wang theory,

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.780
then this problem
is very simple.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.410
All you have to do is
calculate segregation energies,

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.070
and that you can do.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.580
See, now you're back
to the atomistic level.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.190
You could set up a supercell
with a grain boundary

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.790
and really calculate
the energy there.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.540
Do the same on the
surface, and you really

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.865
don't have to do any dynamics.

00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:33.310
And that's what these folks did.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:34.320
This is our work.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.240
This is work that was published
in Science about 10 years ago

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.020
and already by Art Freeman's
group and Greg Olsen, who

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.200
sort of runs a company that
does atomistic modeling

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.200
and other modeling
for steel development.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.490
And essentially, you see
that this theory works out

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.870
very well.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:57.760
On one side, you have the
strong embrittlers, phosphorus

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.480
and sulfur.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.740
And they essentially
have much higher--

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.070
this is the difference
in segregation energy

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.550
between the surface
and the grain boundary.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.490
These very much want to
segregate to the surface.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.390
And that's why they tend to
create internal surfaces,

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:16.150
whereas carbon, to
a lesser extent,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.720
but boron to a large
extent promotes decohesion.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.990
So you can get a fairly
easily good insight

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:27.730
of what are embrittlers
without having to coarse-grain

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.856
across all the length scales.

00:42:31.856 --> 00:42:35.017
AUDIENCE: Why is the
separation different?

00:42:35.017 --> 00:42:36.100
GERBRAND CEDER: I'm sorry?

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.284
AUDIENCE: Why is the separation
different in both boron

00:42:39.284 --> 00:42:42.480
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.420
GERBRAND CEDER: Yeah,
why it's different.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.450
That's actually what that paper
is about, why it's different,

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:49.590
essentially.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.910
And I don't remember
anymore, but I know

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.160
it had to do with the bonding.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.560
This is why these
pictures are here.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.130
There's a very-- I think it
probably has to do with the--

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.080
well, first of all,
boron is smaller.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.170
There's definitely a size
effect, boron and carbon.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.470
These two are much
smaller than these two,

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.450
but there's another
effect, I think,

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.910
which has to do with their--

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.970
these, I think, tend to prefer--

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:19.020
in some sense, have much
more bonding potency.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.540
So in a grain boundary,
they have a lot--

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.460
they have higher coordination.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.370
So they gain a lot more
from covalent bonding

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.100
than these two.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.850
So these two don't
gain as much from being

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.010
coordinated by iron atoms.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.690
I think that's what I seem
to remember, the gist of it.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.110
But that's exactly what
that paper is about.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.357
To sort of end, I wanted
to mention one thing

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:48.440
that we actually haven't
talked about that I think

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.150
that is becoming
a fairly big issue

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.750
in computational modeling.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:57.200
There's sort of
two ways that I've

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.750
mentioned to go from all
this stuff you can calculate

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.960
at the atomistic and electronic
level to the macroscopic level.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.520
One is to just sort
of think your way

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.303
through it, what's important,
and I'll just calculate that.

00:44:07.303 --> 00:44:09.470
And then one is to sort of
do this sort of much more

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.640
explicit coarse-graining or
simply handing off information.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.980
With diffusion, you can
just hand off information.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.140
You can calculate
activation barriers.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.910
You can put that in
a kinetic Monte Carlo

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:21.140
to get diffusivities.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.380
And then you can hand that off
to macroscopic diffusion theory

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.120
and do simulations.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.820
There's really a third
one that's emerging,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.130
and that's sort of
essentially giving up

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.980
on trying to
understand the relation

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.740
between macroscopic
and microscopic,

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.410
but rather try to
determine it statistically.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.120
And this has been done in
chemistry for a long time.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.580
It's really only now, I think,
reaching material science.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.530
Chemists have used
things like QSAR,

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.911
which are a quantum structure--

00:44:52.911 --> 00:44:57.130
and I forget what the A
is-- relations or something.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:01.515
But essentially, their
idea is that maybe there

00:45:01.515 --> 00:45:03.140
are certain macroscopic
properties that

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.770
are so hard to link to the
electronic structure-- that is,

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.680
you just try to correlate them.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.190
And I'll give you an idea--

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.553
an example.

00:45:12.553 --> 00:45:13.970
One where this is
done extensively

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:17.130
is toxicity of molecules.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:21.800
How do you predict
toxicity of molecules?

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.700
This is a very
difficult question.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.190
I mean, how do chemists do it?

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.070
Well, gee, they got a lot
of experience, essentially.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:34.360
All these groups probably react
with this part of your body,

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.222
but how do you even
coarse-grain towards toxicity.

00:45:37.222 --> 00:45:38.680
It's essentially,
what is toxicity?

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:43.690
It's the reactivity would have
an enormous large potential

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.990
of molecules, what your
molecule can do with it.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.870
So people have tried
to do that with QSARs.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.930
Essentially what they say
is, for a lot of molecules

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.110
for which I know that they're
either toxic or not toxic,

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.990
I'm going to calculate
with quantum mechanics,

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.830
as much as I can, bond
lengths, electron densities,

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.360
electron negativities.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.700
I mean, people literally
have parameterized

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.940
charged density
surfaces for molecules.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.680
And then they do a
correlation study.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.590
They do something like
principal component analysis

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.180
or linear regression,
and they see

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.150
which factors at
the atomic scale

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.980
correlate most to the output.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.950
And there are powerful
data mining techniques

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.150
that do exactly this.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:27.890
This is where the
field of science

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.470
really intersects with
a lot of other fields.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.010
When you apply
for a credit card,

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.320
the first thing that people
do on the information you

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.900
provide-- that the companies
do is they data mine you,

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.330
and they predict essentially
your risk of default.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:46.430
And that's all done with
correlation studies.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.410
They have enormous
large databases

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.060
of people who have
been in default,

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.850
and they know that, well,
if you're 23 years old

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:55.917
you're probably more likely to
default than when you're 47.

00:46:55.917 --> 00:46:57.500
And so all that comes
out of the data.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.730
And people have
essentially tried

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:00.320
to do the same thing
with the relation

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.458
between macroscopic behavior
and electronic structure.

00:47:03.458 --> 00:47:05.750
And in chemistry, it's very
well advanced, I would say.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.530
You can buy QSAR software.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.990
You do a search on Google.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:11.000
You'll find it everywhere.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.830
In sort of solid
condensed matter,

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.860
it's really sort
of in its infancy,

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.640
but you're starting to see it.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.860
And one of the reasons I
think it's in its infancy,

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.980
it's harder--

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.540
the link between
those properties

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.660
and electronic
structure is harder.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:31.430
There are intermediate scales
which can mess up the relation.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.470
This would never be
successful probably

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.140
for mechanical
properties because we

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.030
know that things that--

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.340
two materials that
look almost identical

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.990
on the microscopic
scale can have

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.880
very different
mechanical behavior

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.980
depending on the
impurity level, depending

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.570
on the microstructure.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.940
So you kind of already
know ahead of time

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.770
you're lost if you
try to correlate just

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:56.853
to atomistic properties, but
it may work for other cases.

00:47:56.853 --> 00:47:58.520
The other thing that
makes this possible

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.100
is that essentially we get
enormous amounts of computing

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:05.000
power, and we can do very high
throughput data generation

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.990
at the atomistic level.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.865
And I was going to show
you just one example.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.940
So this is the idea that
you essentially correlate

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.025
these things, but let
me skip through that--

00:48:19.025 --> 00:48:22.410
that you use some
kind of learning

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.650
method like neural networks,
or Bayesian statistics,

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.230
or some kind of
correlation method

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:34.330
to correlate output
to calculable input.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.830
So let me show you one example.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:40.260
This is something I
had gotten into myself,

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.250
and still I mean
since a few years--

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.440
sort of a very old
problem, and it

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.900
was essentially
trying to predict

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.947
crystal structure of materials.

00:48:50.947 --> 00:48:52.530
It's a really old
premise, essentially

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.290
an unsolved problem, and
it's an intriguing one,

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.920
because you can actually
show quite dramatically

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.440
that the energetics of
quantum mechanics, the way we

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.270
do it in our density
functional theory--

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.330
is actually pretty much most
of the time accurate enough

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.030
to predict the stable
crystal structure.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.790
So what do I mean with predict?

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.580
What it means is
that the true crystal

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.550
structure will have
the lowest energy,

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:19.440
but the problem is finding it.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.260
So what I'm saying is, if
I gave you a list of 20

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.570
and I say the winner
is among here,

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.030
you're done, because you
calculate the energy of all 20.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.710
And the lowest one
will be the real one,

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.510
but you can't make
that list of 20.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:31.710
That's the problem.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.000
It's a search problem.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.340
It's an optimization
problem, rather than

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.910
a sort of energy problem.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:41.760
So the idea we have
is that, rather

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.360
than trying to calculate
the energy of all crystal

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.100
structures, can you guess
them by calculating a few

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.510
and correlating their relation
with a whole lot of other ones?

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:55.750
So it's the same idea.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.140
Let's say you have
a really big vector.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.895
This is like the energy
of all possible crystal

00:50:00.895 --> 00:50:02.020
structures, whatever it is.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.440
In the end, we have to use
finite numbers, you'll see.

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:08.520
But can I just calculate
a few that goes fast--

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.720
that's the one in blue--

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.240
and then predict
all the ones in red

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.390
without calculating
them so that I get

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:17.700
to sort of a complete vector?

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.708
And the way you want to do
this is by correlation methods.

00:50:21.708 --> 00:50:23.250
The philosophical
question is really,

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:27.540
if you calculate a few pieces
of energetics of materials,

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.850
do you have enough
information in there

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.790
to say a lot more
about the material?

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:34.467
And you can do that explicitly.

00:50:34.467 --> 00:50:36.300
Some people would say
I'm going to calculate

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.397
a few pieces of energetics--
fit potentials to it, say.

00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:41.730
And then with those potentials,
calculate a large amount

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:42.450
of other things.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.183
That's the explicit approach.

00:50:44.183 --> 00:50:45.600
The question you
can ask yourself,

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.090
can you do this implicitly?

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:50.880
And that's what we did
by building correlations.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.450
Essentially, we build a
sort of a smart algorithm--

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.030
call it a neural net or
whatever-- that essentially

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.690
builds this relation.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:01.290
So you train it on large
amounts of data sets

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.340
for which you have
the full vector.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.840
Essentially, you're
asking yourself,

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.580
is there a correlation
between the pink data

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.740
variables and the blue ones?

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.990
And it turns out that there is.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.440
Gee, OK.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.950
Well, this is the
picture I forgot.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.980
You can actually, with
a few calculations,

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:29.310
predict very well the
energy of other things.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.420
And this is sort of the summary.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.960
This is out of a very large
collection of binary metals

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.050
where we did the test,
and this is essentially

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:41.060
out of how many
calculations do you

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.570
need to do to get all the
ground structures in the system

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.540
with a given accuracy?

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.560
Because of course, this
is a statistical method,

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.590
so you're never going to get
100% accuracy, unless you

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.120
calculate everything.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.560
But what you see is that with
something like 15 calculations,

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.890
you get 85% to 90%
accuracy with--

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.300
this is with the data
mining technique.

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:10.210
So this is an example of you
build a predictive method

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:15.840
without a theory, purely
based on statistics.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:19.050
And you see more and
more of that done.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:22.170
There are people who
built correlation methods

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:26.700
between very basic electronic
structure input data

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.850
and finite temperature
data-- for example,

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:34.040
like melting point, which
I think, as you've seen,

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.407
is a non-trivial thing
to actually calculate,

00:52:36.407 --> 00:52:37.990
because melting point
you sort of need

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:41.790
the intersection of the liquid
and the bulk free energy.

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:46.750
So you could argue, how is that
melting point already hidden

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.962
in the energetics, and can
I extract that correlation?

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.910
So I'm going to skip
through a bunch of slides

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:58.490
because I want to
give you enough time

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.220
to do the evaluations.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.530
These were actually slides on
examples of materials design.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.440
Well, maybe I should--
a few more minutes--

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.240
say a few things about it.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.820
One was band gap engineering.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.910
The reason I put it in there
is because bandgap is the one

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.440
thing people always
think with DFT,

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.030
well, I can't do
anything useful.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.060
The bandgap is always like
a factor of 2, sometimes

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.420
more off.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.390
But you can correct for that.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.870
People have made
empirical pseudopotentials

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:26.780
that correct for it.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.400
There are actually
now methods out

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:32.550
there that will give you
the bandgap more accurately.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.960
But the whole idea
is that you still

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.660
get a fairly systematic
ordering of the bandgaps,

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.870
and you look at-- can look
at bunches of semiconductors.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.730
And what I want
to show you here--

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.340
this was actually a
Monte Carlo optimization

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.680
of the bandgap of
super lattices.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.070
These were aluminum gallium
arsenide super lattices,

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:57.560
and essentially the
configuration space

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.740
over which they
searched was, how do you

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.540
arrange the aluminum
and the gallium

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.430
on the cation sublattice?

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:08.360
And so essentially
this was a scheme--

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.280
a Monte Carlo
scheme to sort of go

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.590
to the largest possible
bandgap in that system.

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:18.140
So it's a fairly well known
example of materials designed

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.870
purely by computation,
and you find

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.030
that, after about 10,000
Monte Carlo moves,

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:28.190
you seem to find pretty much
what the maximal bandgap is

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:29.210
in that system.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.030
And then you can try to
make that will then be--

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.080
a thermoelectric is
one where there's

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.300
been several ab initio
predictions for very high

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.440
thermoelectric coefficient.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:45.450
Then I'll show you one was
this lanthanum antimony,

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.555
essentially.

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.790
So my last two slides are
on the future of modeling.

00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:58.400
I can't imagine a
better feel to be in.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.750
And I think there's a few
reasons of-- the two things

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:04.060
that we essentially
benefit from tremendously--

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.480
one is computing power.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.330
I mean, when I started in
this field in the early '90s,

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:13.030
I mean, I can't even
thinking back anymore

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:14.980
how slow and expensive
computers were.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.350
And that's a good 10 years ago.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:22.690
So we ride this curve
with an anomalous benefit.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:25.780
In my department talks,
I usually show numbers.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.670
I think, in the last
20 years, you've

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.830
had an improvement of
sort of performance

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:34.876
versus price of something
like 10 to 50 million.

00:55:34.876 --> 00:55:37.510
That's how much more computing
power you get for your buck

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.653
now than actually
about 15, 20 years ago.

00:55:40.653 --> 00:55:41.320
That's enormous.

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.362
There are no other techniques
in material science

00:55:43.362 --> 00:55:45.020
that do that, period.

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.000
So you ride this enormous curve.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.760
And for whatever
people say, this

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.970
is likely to continue at
least for quite a while.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:54.430
I think another one is that
we benefit tremendously

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:57.310
from all the developments
in condensed matter theory,

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.620
because this allows
us to compute.

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.650
Those allow us-- the
benefits in condensed matter

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:05.860
theory allow us to compute
things much more accurately.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.490
And the third leg is the basic
materials theory development,

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:10.990
which is probably
the sort of weaker

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:13.570
leg of the three-legged stool.

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.750
But so this is
one of the reasons

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:20.030
this field is still very good.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.150
You should keep into
account scaling,

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:26.250
which we've only sort of
cursorily said something about.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:29.410
But here's some examples of
why scaling can kill you.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.380
I put out some
hypothetical examples

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:40.630
of linear scaling examples, cube
scaling examples, and worse.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.060
If you take an example
of linear scaling,

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.960
I think molecular dynamics
with real space potentials

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.940
is probably pretty well
up to linear scaling

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.610
these days, because you
can partition space.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:53.620
As soon as you start
partitioning space

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.120
with finite range
potential, you can

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.120
get basically linear scaling.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.680
So I figured out, what
can you do in 40 years,

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.320
assuming we get about a
factor of 10 to the sixth.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.360
That's what you would
get from Morse's law.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.410
40 years is about
when you retire.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.200
So I mean, I'm
long gone by then,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.840
but you guys are
going to retire.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.010
So where will you be?

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:16.440
Well, let's say we can
do 10 to the 8 atoms.

00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.360
So what is that, 100 million?

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.490
The record stands
more at a billion now,

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:23.792
but nobody kind of performs
at the record all the time.

00:57:23.792 --> 00:57:25.500
You have to essentially
take what you can

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.640
do on an almost daily basis.

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.700
So if you do 100 million
atoms with potentials,

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.510
you'll be able to do
10 to the 14 atoms.

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:34.560
What does that buy you?

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.668
I'm not totally sure.

00:57:36.668 --> 00:57:39.210
You have to ask yourself, what
can you do with 10 to 14 atoms

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.810
that you can't do
with 10 to the 8?

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.360
Because a lot of things don't
depend on the number of atoms.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.130
They depend on the length scale.

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:47.840
And so of course,
the length scale

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.460
is the cube root of
the number of atoms.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.340
So there, you've
only gained about--

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.530
well, you've gained about a
factor of 100 in length scale.

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:58.460
But if you go to something
that scales like the cube.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.950
And I know this is a
little overdoing it--

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:04.498
LDA scales in large problems is
much more like n squared log n.

00:58:04.498 --> 00:58:06.290
But let's say on smaller
problems it's just

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:07.730
like the cube of n.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:11.330
So if you can do 1,000
atoms now, when you retire,

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.530
you'll be able to
do 100,000 atoms.

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:17.037
So where is that
going to take us?

00:58:17.037 --> 00:58:19.370
I think it's going to allow
us to do some things that we

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:20.480
have a hard time with--

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.910
biological species, for example,
where even this is really

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:27.770
cutting it close.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:31.010
You want to do proteins and DNA.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:33.840
Yeah, people do dabble in
it now, and you can do it,

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.310
but it's fighting
against the frontier.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.470
You've got to do solvent,
and so people now

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:43.040
make more ad hoc models
for including the solvent.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.890
I think, when you
do 100,000, you

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:48.170
are going to do
biology much more.

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:50.930
Are you going to do
mechanical behavior?

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:51.950
I don't think so.

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:53.960
Not in the direct
ab initio scale.

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.140
This is probably by no
means enough to sort of span

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:01.010
the length scale from
atoms to microstructure.

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.570
Of course, if you believe that
we're all going to be doing

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:06.630
[? LDA ?] [INAUDIBLE],,
now you're up to--

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:07.880
what is this, a billion atoms?

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.972
So starting to count.

00:59:09.972 --> 00:59:11.680
Of course, when you
have a billion atoms,

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.930
you're going to have to
figure out how to look at them

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.110
and how to extract data from
them, which is non-trivial

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:19.080
at these large simulations.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.953
The people who sort of
broke these frontiers--

00:59:21.953 --> 00:59:24.370
there was a group at Louisiana
State that, for the longest

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:25.472
time, drove this forward.

00:59:25.472 --> 00:59:27.680
And I think they may have
done the first billion atom

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.260
simulation.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:34.060
A lot of the research is in
data transfer, data analysis,

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.040
visualization, because
think about it.

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.110
When you have a
billion atoms, how

00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:39.550
do you decide what's going on?

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.910
You just look at it, or like--

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.480
so that's actually a big
chunk of that research.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.060
And then I took one
that's kind of excessive,

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:51.600
but let's say you do [INAUDIBLE]
configuration interactions,

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.690
which is as close
to-- essentially as

00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:57.000
close to the exact
solution maybe

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.950
that you could get
for quantum mechanics,

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:00.870
except maybe quantum
Monte Carlo now.

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:04.740
But that scaling
is depending on who

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.050
you believe is somewhere
from n to the fifth

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:09.800
to n to the seventh.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.960
It's such small
numbers that it's not

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.750
even really sure you can
quite calibrate the scaling.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.880
But so if you can
do 10 atoms now,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.290
you can only do 100 by
the time you retire.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.930
So these things are
useful for calibration,

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:27.490
but they're not going to allow
us to, say, do DNA and do it

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.880
more accurately.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:36.470
So the only reason I'm saying
is that you will still not

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:39.125
be able to rely on Morse's
law for all your problems.

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:40.500
You still have to
figure out ways

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.360
to, in a sort of smart
way, use computations.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.540
I always find it funny
the proposals I read of we

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.390
can't quite compute this,
but next year we can.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.580
Well, most stuff
you can't compute

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.590
today you won't be able to
compute next year either.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:59.940
And so you'll still
have to find shortcuts.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.810
If you count on being able to
sort of put materials in a box,

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:07.260
and simulate the hell out
of them, and sort of figure

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.050
out what comes up, I
think it's unlikely

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:13.230
that that will happen
in any reasonable time

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:14.525
for a lot of properties.

01:01:14.525 --> 01:01:16.150
There are properties
you can do it for.

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.110
But for most things,
I don't think you can.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.942
So it was a pleasure
teaching you.

01:01:21.942 --> 01:01:23.650
Professor Marzari and
I had a lot of fun.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.222
We always have a lot of
fun with this course.

01:01:26.222 --> 01:01:28.680
We're going to leave you with
the course evaluations, which

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.850
have to be done.

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:32.040
And can I count on you?

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.650
We're not allowed to
touch these, so one of you

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:37.740
has to return this to
department headquarters,

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.050
or to Kathy Farrel.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:46.920
Can I count on one of you just
to pick them up and like--

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.520
OK, thanks, everyone.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.860
OK, thank you.

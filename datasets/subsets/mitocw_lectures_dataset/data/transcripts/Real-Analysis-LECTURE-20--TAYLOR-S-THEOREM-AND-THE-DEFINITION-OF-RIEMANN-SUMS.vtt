00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ:
--differentiable as many times

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.765 align:middle line:90%
as you like.

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.846 align:middle line:84%
And the derivative at
0 equals 0 for all n.

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Why do I bring this up?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Because then the Taylor
polynomial for this function

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:90%
that I've written here at 0--

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:84%
so this is the Taylor
polynomial at 0--

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
just equals, again, the sum
of the derivatives evaluated

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:90%
at 0 times x minus 0 to the k.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.155 align:middle line:84%
But all of the
derivatives are 0.

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the
function is, in fact,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
equal to the
remainder term near 0.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.053 align:middle line:84%
So you see, the remainder
term carries all of f,

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:22.845 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't necessarily
need to be small.

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm trying to say is
that in general, you can't just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
throw away the remainder
term and expect

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.145 align:middle line:84%
that to be even near
the point x, some sort

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
of faithful representation
of the function

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:90%
just by the Taylor polynomial.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Because as we see
for this function,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
the Taylor polynomial
is identically 0.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
If I throw away the remainder
term, I would be saying f is 0,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.485 align:middle line:84%
but it most certainly
is not near x equals 0.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So that was the point
of that discussion.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.425 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's give the proof.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:10.913 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you see, we're just going
to kind of apply the mean value

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
theorem repeatedly to
higher derivatives of f,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily of f, but of
a function we cook up out of f.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's take two points, x0 and
x, not equal to each other.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if they're
equal to each other,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.030 align:middle line:84%
we can take C to be whatever
we want, because then, f of--

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.920 align:middle line:84%
because then what
we pick up is f of x

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
equals f of x on
the right-hand side.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So we can just consider the
case that x0 does not equal x.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.076 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And let M be--

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
this is just a number depending
on x and f0 over x minus x0

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to the n plus 1.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
P sub n This is, again, the
Taylor polynomial of degree n.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:84%
f of x minus P sub n of
x over x minus x sub 0.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a number
depending on x and x0.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Then just rewriting this,
this means that f of x

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is equal to P sub n of x,
the Taylor polynomial of n

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
at x, plus Mx times--

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Mx x0 times x minus x sub
0 over n to the n plus 1.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the goal is to show
that, in fact, this number can

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
be written as the n plus
1 derivative evaluated

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
at some point over
n plus 1 factorial.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the goal-- show
there exists a C and a B

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:84%
such that Mx equals f n plus 1
over C over n plus 1 factorial.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is this
defining characteristic

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:90%
of this Taylor polynomial at--

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
this n-th order
Taylor polynomial?

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Evaluate with respect to x0.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the point is that
this Taylor polynomial

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
agrees with f at x0 up to n-th
order, up to n derivatives.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if I take
the k-th derivative of f

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and evaluate it at
0, this is the same

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
as taking the k-th derivative
of the Taylor polynomial

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and evaluating it at 0.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So the Taylor polynomial agrees
with f up to n derivatives

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:90%
at the point x0.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is the whole
point of Taylor polynomials,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is that they, at
least at the point,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:90%
agree with f up to n-th order.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Does it mean they
agree with f, or even

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
are a good representation of f,
away from x0 like we just saw?

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But at least at x0,
they agree with f.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to define
a new function, which

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.442 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start applying
the mean value theorem to,

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully come up
with this C. It's g of s

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
equals f of s minus P sub
n of s minus this number

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
from earlier times s
minus 0 to the n plus 1.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And something to note is
that this function here,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:90%
this whole function, so g--

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
first off, f is n plus
1 times differentiable.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a polynomial, so it's
n plus 1 times differentiable.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a
polynomial, also.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And s.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.431 align:middle line:84%
So it's n plus 1
times differentiable.

00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:90%
So ns.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.755 align:middle line:90%
Let me draw a picture.

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:90%
We have x0 and x.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
At least in the picture,
x is bigger than x0,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:90%
but that doesn't really matter.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about g of x0?

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is equal to f.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, when I stick
in x0 here, I get 0.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And now f of x0 minus P n of x0,
again, by this first thing here

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:90%
for k equals 0.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.345 align:middle line:90%
This is equal to 0.

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.435 align:middle line:84%
And now, what do I know
about g evaluated at x?

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to f
of x minus P n of x.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the variable that
I'm changing-- or at least,

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:90%
the free variable there, is s.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I stick in x, I
get f of x minus P n of x

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
minus M, this constant
from earlier, which

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I chose depending on x and x0.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.555 align:middle line:84%
But using this relation
here, this is 0.

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
I have that-- the function
f at x0 and at x is 0.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.414 align:middle line:84%
By the mean value theorem,
or Rolle's theorem--

00:08:37.414 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
so by mean value theorem, there
exists a point x1 between x0,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
x such that g prime
of x1 equals 0.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, remember, at x0--

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:90%
or g prime of x1 equals 0.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Now, at x0, we have that--

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So at g prime of x1,
at x1, g prime is 0.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But also, if I look at
the derivative of g at x0,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to f prime of x0
minus P n prime of x0 minus--

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
now, here, I'm working
under the assumption,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.620 align:middle line:84%
just for illustration
purposes, I'm

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.133 align:middle line:84%
assuming n is, say,
bigger than or equal to 2,

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
at least from what I'm
writing down right now.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But if I take the derivative
of this and plug in x0,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:90%
then I will also get 0 here.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So I just get f prime of
x0 minus P n prime of x0.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
So this equals 0.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So I have g prime of x1 equals
0, g prime of x0 equals 0,

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, by the mean
value theorem applied again,

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
there exists a point x2
between x and x0 such

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that the second derivative of
g evaluated at x2 equals 0.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And now, I just iterate this.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I still know, at x0,
the second derivative of g

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
is also 0 as long as n is
bigger than or equal to 2.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll get
that there's x1 here--

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
let me write here, at this
point, we know g equals 0,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:90%
g prime equals 0, and so on.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:90%
At this point, g prime equals 0.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.265 align:middle line:90%
And then at x2--

00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:84%
then the fact that g double
prime here at this point is 0.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And here, we apply the
mean value theorem again.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And we get a point,
x3, in between them

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
where, now, the third
derivative equals 0.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can keep going on,
up until a certain point.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.710 align:middle line:90%
And what point is that?

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
That's when I've taken
away n derivatives here,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and all that I have
left here is s minus x0.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Let me summarize.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:12.545 align:middle line:84%
Continuing in this way,
we see there exists--

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we see for all k
between 0 and n,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
there exists an x sub
k between x0 and x such

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:43.655 align:middle line:84%
that the k-th derivative
at x sub k equals 0.

00:12:43.655 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
In particular, at the k equals
n stage, what do I have?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:90%
x0, x, and this is x sub n.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm just now going to repeat
this argument one last time,

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see where
that leads us.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Since g-- the n-th
derivative of g evaluated

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
at x sub 0 equals
0-- again, this

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:84%
is coming from
this relation here.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Let me, in fact,
write that again.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to f of
x0 minus P n of x0.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'll even write out, this
is equal to Mx x0 n plus 1

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
factorial times x0 minus x0.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens when
I take n derivatives of ns,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:90%
of this monomial here.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:15.795 align:middle line:90%
This, of course, is 0 equals 0.

00:14:15.795 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Since we have that
and we have, it's

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 at this other
point, there exists,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
by the mean value theorem,
now applied to g--

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.810 align:middle line:90%
the n-th derivative of g.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:84%
When I write mean
value theorem here,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not applying it
to the function g.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm applying it
to the derivative.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Here, I was applying
it just to g.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Here, I was applying
the mean value theorem

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.715 align:middle line:90%
to the derivative of g.

00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And, here I'm now
applying the mean value

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:84%
theorem to the n-th
derivative of g.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.825 align:middle line:84%
Let me make that
perfectly clear.

00:15:14.825 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:28.740 align:middle line:84%
There exists a number, C,
between x and x0 such that

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the n plus 1-- the
derivative of g,

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of the n-th
order derivative of g,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
so the n plus 1st
derivative of g--

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
of C equals 0.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:90%
But what does this mean?

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I take n plus 1
derivatives with respect

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:58.825 align:middle line:90%
to s of this over here, I get f.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I take n plus 1
derivatives of an n-th degree

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:90%
polynomial, I get 0.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
If I take two derivatives of
a degree 1 polynomial, which

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%
is just x, I get 0.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
If I take three derivatives of
a degree 2 polynomial, I get 0.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So I get 0 for when I
differentiate n plus 1 times

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
an n-th degree polynomial minus
this constant again times n

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
plus 1 derivatives of
this monomial here in s.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.723 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.723 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, all of
these derivatives

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing down here,
these are all in terms of s.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Times n plus 1 factorial.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And this equals 0.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
This is just this
here expressed here.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And it should be C, I'm sorry.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Because we're plugging in C.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But that means
precisely that, which is

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:90%
what I wanted to show existed.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
At this point C, this constant
from earlier, which, remember,

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
was defined in this
way, is actually

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
equal to the n plus 1 derivative
of f evaluated at some C.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, f of x is
equal to P n of x plus--

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
x C times-- where C
is between x and x0.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, Taylor's theorem
says a couple of things,

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't say
certain things.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The mean value theorem,
as it's written,

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
says there exists some point in
between so that the secant line

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
from f of b to f of a is
equal to the derivative

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of the function, the
tangent to the graph,

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:90%
at some point in between.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't tell you that
the function near a point

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:90%
can necessarily--

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:90%
what am I trying to say?

00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
What Taylor's
theorem does say is

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that you can iterate
the mean value theorem

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:90%
for higher-order derivatives.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But what it doesn't say is that
this polynomial that you get

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:84%
over here, which
you interpret kind

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of as an approximation of
the function f near x0,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't say
that approximation

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.228 align:middle line:90%
is necessarily good.

00:19:25.228 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we just saw
from this example

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.565 align:middle line:84%
that that remainder term may end
up being the entire function.

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But still, that doesn't
make it any less

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:90%
useful in applications.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a simple application
of Taylor's theorem, which

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you had endless
homework problems or exam

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
problems on back when
you first took calculus

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and were finding critical points
and trying to characterize them

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
as relative minimums
or relative maximums.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:84%
We have the second
derivative test,

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:90%
which says the following--

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
which states that,
suppose I have a function

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
from the open interval
a, b to R. And suppose

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
this has two
continuous derivatives

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:90%
on this open interval a, b.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:84%
If, at a point in a, b,
the derivative equals 0,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and the second derivative
of f, you evaluated it at 0,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:53.125 align:middle line:84%
x sub 0 is positive, then
f has a relative min at x0.

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I should say that this
is a strict relative min.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
a strict relative min and just

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:90%
a relative min?

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
A strict relative min, I
mean that if I'm at any point

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
other than x0 and
I'm nearby, then

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:90%
f of x is bigger than f of x0.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write that here.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.725 align:middle line:90%
That means near x0--

00:22:32.725 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let's
just briefly recall

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
what the definition
of relative min is.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And this will allow me
to state what it means

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:90%
to be a strict relative min.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:84%
This means there exists
a delta positive such

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:17.295 align:middle line:90%
that for all x, n--

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:84%
such that for all x,
x minus x0 implies

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
f of x is bigger than f of x0.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the definition
of strict relative min.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
A strict relative
min is a relative min

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:84%
because, what's the
only thing missing

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
from the definition
of relative min

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
is, what happens if
I evaluate at x0?

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And then at x0, we get
f of x0 equals f of x0.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:25.838 align:middle line:84%
so a strict relative
min is a relative min,

00:24:25.838 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:90%
but it's a little bit stronger.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Because it's saying that as
long as x is not equal to x0,

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
meaning this thing is
bigger than 0, f of x

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than f of x0, not
bigger than or equal to.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I hate doing this, but the
theorem's stated over there,

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and now we need to go across
the room to do the proof.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:84%
f has two continuous
derivatives on a, b.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.055 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the second
derivative is continuous at 0.

00:25:10.055 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Since the second
derivative is continuous,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
we get that the limit,
as x goes to x0--

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:90%
or, let me put--

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:84%
instead of x, say C. This
equals f double prime of x0,

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
which is positive,
by assumption.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.765 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're assuming.

00:25:35.765 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by an exercise
in one of the assignments,

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
since this limit, this
implies that there

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
exists a delta 0 positive such
that for all 0 bigger than C,

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:90%
bigger than x0--

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and in fact, we can include--

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:90%
let me see.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
There exists a delta 0
positive such that, for all C,

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:90%
satisfying--

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:56.010 align:middle line:84%
we get that f prime
of C is positive.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.790 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is we
have this point, x0.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:90%
x0 plus delta 0.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:90%
x0 minus delta 0.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And then on this interval, f
double prime of C is positive.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.030 align:middle line:84%
You proved that, in
fact, in an assignment.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
If the limit of a function
as I approach a point

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
equals l, which is positive,
then near the point,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:90%
the function has to be positive.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have to verify that--

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:90%
what am I trying to do?

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to verify that I have
a strict relative minimum so

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
that there exists a delta--

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I have this delta
0, which ensures

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that the second derivative
is positive on this interval.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I say choose delta
to be this delta 0.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, I have to show
that this delta works,

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
meaning for all x
satisfying that inequality,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I have f of x is
bigger than f of x0.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:18.585 align:middle line:90%
So take an x between delta--

00:28:18.585 --> 00:28:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, within delta
distance to x0.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.818 align:middle line:90%
Here's x, say.

00:28:30.818 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Then by Taylor's theorem, there
exists a C between x and x0--

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:90%
so here's x.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:84%
There's this point
C between x and x0,

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:84%
which I can always choose
strictly in between them, such

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that I have that f
of x equals f of x0

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
plus f prime of x0
times C minus x0 plus--

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:90%
no, that should be x, sorry--

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:84%
plus f double prime of C over
2 times x minus m 0 squared.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, at x0, the derivative
is assumed to be 0.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We're assuming the
derivative vanishes at x0

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and the second derivative
is positive there.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So this equals f
of x0 plus f prime

00:29:54.850 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:84%
of C over 2 times
x minus x0 squared.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, on this whole interval,
which is where I'm looking at,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:90%
f double prime of C is positive.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So this thing here is positive.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And as long as x
minus x0 is not 0--

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:84%
as long as x is not equal to
x0-- this thing is positive.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a square.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.707 align:middle line:84%
So this is strictly
bigger than f of x0, which

00:30:25.707 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
is what I wanted to prove.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So I have proven that f of
x is bigger than f of x0

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:90%
on this interval here.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the picture
that goes along

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:52.950 align:middle line:84%
with this is something like,
let's say, the point x0, 0,

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:84%
at least near this point,
the derivative is 0.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The second derivative
is positive.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.725 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the
function should look.

00:31:03.725 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ:
So that concludes

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to say
about differentiation.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I have put in the assignment
the most useful version

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
of L'Hopital's rule,
which is kind of the only

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
other main thing we're
missing right now from just

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:90%
the theory of differentiation.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But remember, differentiation
is a bit of a miracle,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:84%
as I've said before,
because there

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:53.200 align:middle line:84%
exist continuous functions
that never have a derivative.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Integration, which is what
we're moving on to now,

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:90%
is not so much of a miracle.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.360 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Because as we'll show,
every continuous function

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
has a Riemann integral, which
is a different limiting process.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
we're talking about,

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.320 align:middle line:84%
all of these
notions-- continuity

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is a notion that
involves limits.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Differentiation is a
process involving limits,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and integration is a
process involving limits.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, integration
is not as harsh a process

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:90%
as differentiation.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.690 --> 00:33:03.600 align:middle line:84%
We're moving on,
now, to Riemann--

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I should say the
Riemann integral,

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
but I'll say
Riemann integration.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:90%
What is Riemann integration?

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.625 align:middle line:84%
It is-- you were told this
in calculus, but maybe

00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:27.680 align:middle line:90%
in not so careful a way.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a theory
of what it means--

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or this is a number that
we associate to a function

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that you interpret as the
area underneath the curve.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:84%
It is not, as maybe
you're told, somehow

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.560 align:middle line:84%
magically equal to the
area underneath the curve.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:84%
There is no notion of
area underneath the curve.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
The Riemann integral
is a number which

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
you interpret as the
area underneath the curve

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because it agrees
with what you think

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:84%
the area underneath the curve
should be for simple examples.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.719 align:middle line:84%
For example, a
half-circle or just a box.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:90%
These two notions agree.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.889 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you interpret
the Riemann integral,

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
which is a number obtained
by a limiting process,

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:84%
as the area
underneath the curve.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It is not somehow,
out in the universe,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:84%
there is this notion of
area underneath the curve,

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and the Riemann
integral magically

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:90%
coincides with that notion.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
It is a theory, if you
like, of assigning a number

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that we interpret as the
area underneath the curve.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's good for--

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
very good for,
especially once we

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:84%
get to the real
miracle of calculus,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental theorem of
calculus, which connects

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
the derivative to
integration-- it's

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
fantastic in being able to,
in its ease of computing.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, at some
point, you go on

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to learn about Lebesgue
integration, which

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.645 align:middle line:84%
is a much more versatile notion
of area underneath the curve.

00:35:19.645 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.745 align:middle line:90%
And a little bit more robust.

00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:84%
We have better theorems that
you can then use and prove--

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:90%
prove, then use, of course.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But Riemann integration
is a place to start.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in some treatments
of Lebesgue integration,

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Lebesgue immigration is treated
as the completion of Riemann

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.120 align:middle line:84%
integration, just
as the real numbers

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:58.120 align:middle line:84%
are the completion, in some
sense, of the rational numbers.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's set up some definitions
and notions that we'll need.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to be talking
about Riemann integration

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:90%
of continuous functions.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the simplest way to go.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Why not for some general
functions or something

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Because in general,
a function does not

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:90%
have a Riemann integral.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So you could try to ask, can
you characterize what functions

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.480 align:middle line:90%
do have a Riemann integral?

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that is
functions which are continuous,

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, almost everywhere.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Almost everywhere, though,
we don't have the machinery

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.740 align:middle line:90%
to describe that.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a measure theory course.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you cannot--
or at least,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.460 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have the
machinery to fully state what

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.950 align:middle line:84%
it means, a precise "if and
only if" statement about when

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:00.640 align:middle line:84%
a function is Riemann integral,
I'm just going to do the ribbon

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.040 align:middle line:84%
in a rule for
continuous functions,

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.260 align:middle line:84%
which is nice and
simple enough--

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.025 align:middle line:90%
and still pretty.

00:37:06.025 --> 00:37:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Let me just
introduce, first, some

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:84%
notation that I'll
be using a lot.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:90%
C of a, b.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be the set
of all continuous functions

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
from a, b to R. So f from
a, b to R. f is continuous.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I said, we're going
to associate to an interval

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:90%
and a function-- a number--

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:84%
which we will later
interpret as a notion of area

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.300 align:middle line:90%
underneath the curve.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:84%
This process is a
limiting process where

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
taking the domain

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and cutting it up into
smaller and smaller pieces,

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and somehow writing down
a number that we think

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.455 align:middle line:84%
approximates the area, is
a good approximate area

00:38:24.455 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:90%
underneath the curve.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assign some words
to this breaking down process.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Partition of the interval a, b.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:52.592 align:middle line:84%
This is just a finite
set x underline,

00:38:52.592 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:90%
which I'll write in this way.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a finite set, which I
write x0, x1, x2, up to xn,

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.860 align:middle line:84%
with the property that x0 is
equal to a is less than x1,

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.595 align:middle line:90%
less than x2.

00:39:09.595 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The norm of a partition,
which I denote

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:84%
with these two vertical lines
on either side of x underline,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is by definition, the
max of the differences

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:90%
between these partition points.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I refer to these points that are
in the partition as partition

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.750 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:84%
This is x1 minus x0, and
so on, xn minus xn minus 1.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:14.780 align:middle line:84%
A tag for partition x
bar is a finite set xi.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Get used to some Greek
letters in your life.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Xi equals C1 up to Cn.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.378 align:middle line:84%
As before, in the partition,
we started off with a 0 here.

00:40:24.378 --> 00:40:25.295 align:middle line:90%
We started off with 1.

00:40:25.295 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Such that each of these xis
lie between partition points.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:41.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, x0 is less
than xi 1 is less than x1.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.370 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And the pair is referred
to as a tagged partition.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Although maybe it looks a
little bit fancy, it's not.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:84%
A partition is, you
take your interval a, b,

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and you cut it up into pieces,
with your first point always

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:84%
being a and your last
point always being b.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So x1, x2, and because
I can't draw n points,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to draw four points.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:90%
x3, x4.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a partition
of a, b, into--

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
think of these points
as being the endpoints

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of little intervals that
I've broken up the bigger

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:90%
interval into.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And the xis are just points in
each of these little intervals.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.520 align:middle line:90%
C1 has to land there.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.785 align:middle line:90%
xi 2 could land in the next one.

00:42:14.785 --> 00:42:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It could actually be
the endpoint if we like.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.348 align:middle line:90%
xi 3.

00:42:21.348 --> 00:42:22.515 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it's the midpoint.

00:42:22.515 --> 00:42:26.021 align:middle line:90%


00:42:26.021 --> 00:42:28.585 align:middle line:90%
We'll say xi 4 is there as well.

00:42:28.585 --> 00:42:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:84%
The tagged points are just lying
in these smaller intervals.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And at least in this picture,
the biggest separation

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:47.410 align:middle line:84%
between partition points
would be something

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:54.850 align:middle line:90%
like x3 minus x2 here.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:84%
The norm of a
partition is the length

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.690 align:middle line:90%
of the largest subinterval.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I drew kind of
something abstract here.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's make this more concrete.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's say I'm looking at--

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:84%
just to write down
a few examples,

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:38.510 align:middle line:84%
let's say my interval
is 1, 3, and then

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:52.850 align:middle line:84%
my partition are the
points 1, 3/2, 2, 3.

00:43:52.850 --> 00:44:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And then my set
of tags are 5/4--

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.140 align:middle line:90%
just a midpoint-- 7/4, 5/2.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.470 align:middle line:90%
So my partition is 1.

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.075 align:middle line:90%
There's 2.

00:44:14.075 --> 00:44:14.575 align:middle line:90%
3/2.

00:44:14.575 --> 00:44:17.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Those are my partition points.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.785 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, my
tags are the midpoint.

00:44:23.785 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the norm
of this partition

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:84%
is the maximum of the lengths
of these smaller subintervals

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:84%
here-- not the ones using C,
but the one with the partition

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So max of 3/2 minus 1, 2 minus
3/2, 3 minus 2, and is 1--

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:90%
the length of this subinterval.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, given a tagged
partition, we're

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.350 align:middle line:84%
going to associate a number to
this tagged partition, which

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:52.795 align:middle line:84%
we interpret as an
approximate area.

00:45:52.795 --> 00:46:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:18.319 align:middle line:84%
Let f be a continuous function,
xi, a tagged partition

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:26.265 align:middle line:90%
the Riemann sum associated to--

00:46:26.265 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.475 align:middle line:90%
I should say, of f--

00:46:32.475 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:53.800 align:middle line:84%
associated to the tag
partition xi is the number

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:90%
s sub f of x bar--

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, x underline,
xi underline,

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:84%
which is the sum from k
equals 0 to k equals 1 to n

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of f of xi k times
xk minus xk minus 1.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:20.080 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, what we interpret
this number as--

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.620 align:middle line:90%
how do we interpret this number?

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.050 align:middle line:90%
We interpret it as somehow--

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:36.860 align:middle line:84%
we give meaning to this
number as an approximate area.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:45.580 align:middle line:84%
If this is a, b, and
there's a function f,

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and let's say those are
the partition points.

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:90%
So x1, x2, x3, x4, x0.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And let's say the tags are just
the right endpoints of each

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.390 align:middle line:90%
of these smaller intervals.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Then what is this number, at
least in terms of this picture?

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:28.705 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a little
off, but anyways.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:84%
What I've shaded
in, this area, this

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:53.560 align:middle line:84%
equals this Riemann sum of f
associated to this tag here.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And let me go over,
again, the graph of f.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.160 align:middle line:84%
This number here which
we've come up with we

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:84%
interpret as somehow
being an approximate area.

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't like saying
area underneath the curve,

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.980 align:middle line:84%
because that
presupposes that there

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is a notion of the area
underneath the curve

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.760 align:middle line:84%
independent of what
we're doing here.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.500 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We are, in fact,
giving a theory--

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:84%
a mathematical theory-- of
area underneath the curve.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
We are prescribing
a number which

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.160 align:middle line:84%
we interpret as the area
underneath the curve.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.075 align:middle line:84%
These Riemann sums we interpret
as being approximate areas.

00:49:44.075 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:90%


00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.410 align:middle line:84%
What we would like
to do is somehow

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:53.390 align:middle line:84%
take a limit as the lengths
of these subintervals

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:58.340 align:middle line:84%
get smaller and smaller, as the
norm of the partitions go to 0.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And what we would like to say is
that these approximate areas--

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.380 align:middle line:90%
these are just numbers--

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.570 align:middle line:84%
converge to some
limiting number--

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.750 align:middle line:90%
a, say.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:13.790 align:middle line:84%
That number we refer to as
the Riemann integral of f,

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and we interpret as the area
underneath the graph of f.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this to
work, we have to show

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that as we take partitions with
smaller and smaller norm, where

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.660 align:middle line:84%
the intervals get
smaller and smaller,

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:38.890 align:middle line:84%
these approximate areas actually
do converge to some number.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be the
content of the next lecture,

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.320 align:middle line:84%
in which we'll prove the
existence of the Riemann

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:84%
integral and do some
properties about.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So the take-home
point is, again, there

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:57.220 align:middle line:84%
is no definition of area
underneath the curve

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:90%
independent of what we're doing.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, out
there in the universe,

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.200 align:middle line:84%
there's a notion of the
area underneath the curve,

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and when we compute
the Riemann integral,

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.210 align:middle line:90%
magically, those two things--

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:12.490 align:middle line:90%
those two numbers-- coincide.

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.670 align:middle line:84%
We are giving-- we
are constructing

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:21.880 align:middle line:84%
a theory of the area
underneath the curve, which,

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:27.580 align:middle line:84%
for example, for a half-circle,
or square, or ellipse,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
do, in fact, coincide
with stuff you

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.530 align:middle line:90%
know from ordinary geometry.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
gives a good theory

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:38.470 align:middle line:90%
of area underneath the curve.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But in order for us to
construct that theory,

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.180 align:middle line:84%
or how we're
constructing that theory,

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.750 align:middle line:84%
is for a continuous
function, we define a number

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.790 align:middle line:84%
associated to a
partition, which we

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.740 align:middle line:90%
interpret as approximate areas.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.620 align:middle line:84%
We would like to say these
approximate areas converge

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to some number as the
partitions get finer and finer,

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.280 align:middle line:84%
or as the norm gets
smaller and smaller.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And that limiting
number we interpret

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:84%
as the area
underneath the curve.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:17.510 align:middle line:84%
That will be what we do
next time, is actually show

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
this limiting number,

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the Riemann
integral of f.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And we'll stop there.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:32.000 align:middle line:90%

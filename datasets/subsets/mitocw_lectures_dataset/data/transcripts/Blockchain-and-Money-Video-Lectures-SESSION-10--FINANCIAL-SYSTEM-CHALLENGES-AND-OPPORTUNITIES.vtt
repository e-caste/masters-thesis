00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.870
GARY GENSLER: Thanking
everybody to coming back.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.990
I think there'll be a few
people coming in late,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.675
still hitting the send
button on the papers.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.230
I want to thank everybody
that submitted papers

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.860
before the ninth class,
because I actually

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.210
had a chance to read those 26.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.060
Since there are actually
officially 84 or 85 people

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.890
registered for this
class, I'm intrigued

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.805
to see if 59 papers
came in a minute ago.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.340
Human nature being human
nature, these are just

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.250
the statistics on this class.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450
And as far as those of
you who may have seen,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.780
I chose that part
of the experience

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.730
here is actually eyes on--

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.310
meaning my eyes on your papers--

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.870
and giving comments.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.120
If you don't want the comments,
you just want a grade,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.970
you can always give me a
heads up and send me an email,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.590
and I will take less time.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.230
I want to compliment everybody.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.130
They're good.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.620
I mean, there is a good
engagement, a good dialogue.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.720
You will see occasionally
that I don't give you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.120
everything you want back.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.540
But a couple observations.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.810
It's really an
opportunity, on any topic

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.590
you want to choose in the
second half of the semester up

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.230
to maybe the 23rd class,
please, if 70 of you

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.620
hand it in on the 23rd class,
that is your right, that

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.170
is your option, it's just--

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.900
it's just going to be
harder on Sabrina, Thalita,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.730
and me to grade.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.280
But it's to use
critical reasoning

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.120
about that week's topic.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.923
So let me just mention two or
three things some of you did--

00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:10.090
I'm not going to be harsh
about it-- but some of you

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.100
did that's not what
I'm looking for.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.190
I'm not looking for just
addressing the three study

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.850
questions.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.510
The three study questions
are about us together here.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.550
And just to sort of talk.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.990
Secondly, I'm not
looking for you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.510
to take a reading
from six weeks earlier

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.530
and describe that reading,
or three weeks earlier.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.070
So if you choose, in the
future, to take November 15th--

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.240
I know November 15th,
because we're going to--

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.290
it's going to be our second
time with outside speakers,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.970
and it's a really
important time,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.480
if you look at that class, to
write something on that class

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.693
when it's--

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:53.610
we're fortunate enough
that Jeff Sprecher, who

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.560
is the Chief Executive Officer
of the Intercontinental

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.580
Exchange, and Kelly Loeffler,
who is the Chief Executive

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.630
Officer of Bakkt, are going
to come and do a class with us

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.380
about payment systems and what
ICE and the New York Stock

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.427
Exchange is trying to
do in payment systems.

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:11.260
I'm just using that.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.960
If you write about that,
it's really about that, not

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.910
about everything earlier.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.830
And when we get
earlier, I'll probably

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.450
say more about that class.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.670
And we were
fortunate to have one

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.650
of America's true
great entrepreneurs

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.280
join us in Jeff
Sprecher that week.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.610
Who has, from scratch,
created a $50 billion

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.387
market cap company in 20 years.

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:35.470
So those were my comments.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.880
The papers were generally good.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.560
Really looking for critical
reasoning, ground truths.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.570
Where did you take something?

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.015
Some of you brought a great
narrative voice, by the way.

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:47.890
I have to compliment.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.560
There were a couple--
a handful that I really

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.700
found you're really good
writers and in addition to

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.610
being good business students.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.160
So those are my thoughts today.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.450
I'm going to go through--

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.048
oh, and we have we have an
interesting guest next Tuesday,

00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:05.090
but I'm not going to say
anything more than that.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.790
You'll find it fun.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.050
Tuesday the 16th.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.890
STUDENT: Nakamoto?

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.973
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:10.900
STUDENT: Nakamoto?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.340
GARY GENSLER: Nakamoto!

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.720
Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.920
No, no.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.260
Any other guesses?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.610
I'm not giving any clues,
but I will tell you you

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.550
will have fun next
Tuesday the 16th.

00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:27.205
It will be a guest you will
not see at any other class.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.410
So today, I want to talk about--

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.990
Ah, Tom's thinking
about it, right?

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.160
Intrigued.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.100
We're going to talk a
little bit about finance.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.490
Now, just as a
way of background,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.680
I've spent 39 years in finance.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.100
So this is just my chance
to take 80 minutes to talk

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.900
about finance with all of you.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.260
We did have readings
that will tie into it.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.390
So overview, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.230
about the readings, of
course, as we always do.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.720
Three slices of finance
for a moment-- finance

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.300
and financial institutions.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.050
What is a financial institution?

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.110
What does that word mean,
and how do we think about it?

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.610
Finance and regulation,
finance and technology.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.080
So three quick
slices of finance.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.400
What is credit?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.750
What's capital markets?

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.160
Again, a broad sort of
Gensler's view of it,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.940
maybe, but still I
think you could--

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.300
it's grounded in
academic literature.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.690
Then what are the risks?

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.010
I spent a bunch of
time at Goldman Sachs.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.210
One of the last things I did as
kind of the cofinance officer

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.150
was also sit on the
firm-wide risk committee.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.120
And so sort of
bringing insight into,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.380
what is risk
management in finance?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.430
Or at least in the capital
market side of finance.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.240
And crises.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.200
I'm going to spend a couple
of minutes on the OA crisis.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.900
Some perspective from a
guy who lived through it.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.330
And then some of
the opportunities

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.830
in the blockchain world.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.030
We'll try to wrap and be out
of here at 3:55, as usual.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.480
So this study questions--

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.900
which, now I know there's
probably 58 papers on this

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.140
in the inbox, I think.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.170
But does anybody
want to lend a hand?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.880
I mean, it's getting shorter.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.800
It's only 20 people
on this list now.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.510
But that means
that 25% of you are

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.330
thinking that class
participation is not

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.500
that important.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.200
We're going to have to find a
way that if somebody's still

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.480
on this list in a while
that I don't give somebody

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.620
a terrible grade.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.420
Because 30% of the grade
is class participation.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.350
I just say that.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm humorous about it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.610
I'm willing to work
with people that,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.250
if your language skills aren't
there and you're just shy,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.830
or you have an issue.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.377
But does Monica want
to help me out at all?

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:51.960
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.750
So, I'm back here.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.330
So one of the trade offs that
I talked about in my paper

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.520
was that we saw from
one of the articles

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.210
that, as bankers were
making more money,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.080
there is a greater
income disparity that we

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.260
saw in the entire sector.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.420
And then one of the other
things I talked about,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.210
as some of these
institutions combined,

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.220
they created like these huge
conglomerates and the act

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.970
kind of deregulated
the space that

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.760
allowed for that to happen.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.200
GARY GENSLER: So Monica's
raising two things, probably

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.910
from the Harvard paper, but
two things that about income

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.520
disparities and also
the concentration.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.010
Anything else that people
took from that Harvard--

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.940
I know it was a little
dense, but the paper?

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.810
Is that a hand up?

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.890
Is that-- no?

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.510
You sure?

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.720
Oh, come on.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.077
What's your first name?

00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:50.160
STUDENT: Cece [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.430
Sorry, I'm not in
the class list.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.897
[INAUDIBLE] visiting
MIT and hoping I

00:07:55.897 --> 00:07:57.475
can audit this class today.

00:07:57.475 --> 00:07:58.300
GARY GENSLER: All
right. [? Cece ?]

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.350
is here as a listener.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.390
Thank you.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.018
Do you want--

00:08:02.018 --> 00:08:02.560
STUDENT: Dan.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.395
GARY GENSLER: Dan.

00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:06.520
STUDENT: Yeah, in the
Harvard paper, I just thought

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.990
was interesting.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.200
It was that that act in 1994
that essentially caused--

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.740
it was the catalyst for
just massive consolidation

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.710
of the financial
services industry.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.670
And so that's what ultimately
led to disproportionate wages,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.460
or disproportionate
economic rents,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.882
when related to productivity.

00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:29.590
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.030
So can you remind me which act?

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.970
Because '94 isn't
ringing a bell.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.450
I mean, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley was 1999,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.582
and I don't know if there
was something in '94 that--

00:08:40.582 --> 00:08:43.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.274
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.320
STUDENT: Riegle-Neal.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.900
GARY GENSLER: Riegle-Neal.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.150
OK.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.380
So Dan's raising that it's
also regulation and law

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.940
has a lot of effect on it.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.520
Consolidation is happening
in many industries.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.420
Finance is not separate
from those industries.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.660
50, 60 years ago, you
had the local drugstores,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.420
now we have the big chains
like CVS and the like.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.620
So I just mention that the
consolidation happens a lot.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.370
One thing that I would say
on the other side of that,

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.610
having actually watched
and observed some of it,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.340
is there was the desire
to merge a lot of banking.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.240
But the US, in contrast
to other countries,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.000
didn't have interstate banking.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.190
All the way into
the 1970s, banks

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.830
had to be within their own--

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.230
one of the 50 states, literally.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.230
That started to break
down in the late '70s.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.820
It started-- Riegle Neal in
'94, pretty much then it was,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.360
Katie bar the door, we
could have national banking.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.090
And then by 1999,
we also could have

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.950
commercial banking and
investment banking together,

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.230
which is Gramm-Leach-Bliley.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:53.730
I'm sorry.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.770
I want to come back
here, but next to Dan.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.745
STUDENT: I was going to say that
basically, the paper basically

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:03.620
went through a process
of elimination of what

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.990
could explain the
higher economic rents,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.290
and basically checked
everything off the list.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.780
It said it was basically
a bit of manipulation,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.455
because there was more
power by the banks that

00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:15.290
had consolidated.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.360
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.960
Erin, do you see that
as manipulation or just

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.730
an opportunity to get some
oligopolistic or monopolistic

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.645
rents?

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:30.734
And I'm just discerning
the word manipulation--

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:32.730
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.970
I guess what they were--

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.720
yeah, I mean I think it's--

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.150
I mean manipulation in
the sense that, higher--

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.740
maybe taking advantage
in a way that

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.680
wouldn't exist in a market
that wasn't so consolidated

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.380
compared to other markets
that were consolidated

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.012
and regulated, such as Canada.

00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:50.470
Because he made a
lot [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.760
GARY GENSLER: I would note that
every entrepreneur's desire,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.880
in a business context,
maybe not in a moral sense,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.120
is to be able to
collect economic rents.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.520
Like you start out
as a disruptor,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.740
and along the journey,
you would actually

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.910
wish to become somebody
who collects excess profits

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.890
or becomes the monopolist.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.130
I'm not speaking
that you literally

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.170
want to take
advantage of people,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.650
but you do want to sort
of collect excess rents.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.550
And so it's a sort of
natural transformation.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.310
I'm sorry, there
was a hand here.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.200
STUDENT: Yeah, similar to what
Eric said last, compare also--

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.900
concentration by
regulation, or concentration

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.210
by deregulating the market,
and by regulating it,

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.720
incumbents are able
to take more risks.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.140
And that is bad for
financial systems.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.500
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.020
Brotish?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.560
STUDENT: Not from the paper,
more from personal experience.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.090
So the way I see it is
the financial institutions

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.250
are increasingly trying
to be at the center

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.160
of a lot of
different [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.900
of different business.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.635
And with many
innovative products,

00:12:02.635 --> 00:12:06.950
they are kind of connected
like people across the industry

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.890
chain.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.270
So they kind of [INAUDIBLE]
some sort of accountability

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.190
with [INAUDIBLE] valuations.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.780
And when a financial
institution is at risk,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.520
it connects all the different
players in the value chain.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.353
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:26.910
So Brotish is raising also
that finance, partly because

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.030
of its centrality
in the economy,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.570
tries to add other products
or add other things

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.410
and be at the center of the
value proposition or chain.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.050
I would contend there is
also non-financial firms that

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.670
try to do the same
thing into finance.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.100
So big tech right now--

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:51.270
you think about Apple Pay,
or think of Alibaba in China.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.700
But then Ant Financial is
one of the most significant.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.820
So sometimes it
comes the other way.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.630
If you can leverage a network,
leverage your centrality

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.960
to a market and add products.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.020
But I agree with you, it
goes both ways, though.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.830
Other comments
from the readings?

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.450
Isabella?

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
articles also

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.062
was sort of the idea of
innovation ahead of regulation.

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.020
The nice thing about
bringing in new technology

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.853
is that it does take
time for the government

00:13:20.853 --> 00:13:22.420
to actually regulate it.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.450
And I know one of the
articles, or the interview

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.420
talked about needing to further
regulate and restructure

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.170
the banks.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.462
That's not something that's
going to happen, especially

00:13:30.462 --> 00:13:35.020
with people trying to overturn--
is it the Dodd-Frank act?

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.520
Yes.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.673
So it's not really
going in that direction,

00:13:37.673 --> 00:13:39.590
but it's something people
talk about it a lot.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.560
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.180
So there is an ebb and
flow of regulation,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.150
and we'll chat in
a couple minutes.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:50.070
Regulation in finance has been
around for thousands of years.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.660
I mean, literally,
back when the Hammurabi

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.650
code was being written, there
were regulated interest rates.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.450
We went through a
long period in Europe

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.290
where actually it was illegal
to charge an interest rate,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.660
for hundreds of years
in different societies.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.650
So there is an ebb and flow.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.430
Now it's much more
complicated today.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.870
In a sense.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.090
And Isabel was just
mentioning that Dodd-Frank,

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.860
passed in the US, was
a post crisis reform.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.170
That would be a time, a
period you would think, well,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.140
maybe the public, through
its legislative body,

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.600
will lean into doing
more regulation.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.110
And then as you move away
from a crisis moment,

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.500
you see some easing up.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:38.895
And there is always sort of an
oscillation over the decades.

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:40.020
Why don't we take one more?

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.540
STUDENT: So I think one of
the other interesting things

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.000
that the article brought up
was the case of Citigroup,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.470
which basically highlights
the tradeoff perfectly.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.350
So on the positive
side, if you look

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.250
at Citigroup, what
it's trying to do

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.160
is it's trying to provide
universal services.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.810
So it's a one stop shop for
all your financial services.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.043
Whereas [INAUDIBLE]
argued that one

00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:03.710
of the things that
should have been done

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.220
post crisis was to break it up.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.610
Because the problem with having
the universal one-stop shop

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.390
is that, if it fails, then
it's an obligation on the fed

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.310
actually prevent it.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.360
GARY GENSLER: So [INAUDIBLE]
raising something

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.850
about Citigroup or
Citicorp that became,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.110
in a sense, a one
stop shop, a shopping

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.940
center of financial
products, so maybe it

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.080
should've been broken up.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.500
But who wants to tell
me what Sheila Bair, who

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.550
was the head of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation,

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.240
said?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.400
Because in that interview with
Sheila, she talked about Citi.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.140
Alpha?

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.550
STUDENT: She said
she almost, I guess,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.600
regrets not letting
them restructure

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.345
and letting them fail,
because it created

00:15:48.345 --> 00:15:51.100
this sort of a moral
protection that people

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.358
thought that [INAUDIBLE] large
[INAUDIBLE] shouldn't survive.

00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:57.900
GARY GENSLER: Kelly, were you
going to add something to that?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.775
STUDENT: Yeah, I was.

00:15:58.775 --> 00:16:00.700
I thought her interview was--

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.990
it's kind of hard to weed
out what she's really saying,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.230
because it's toned with
little strings of bias.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.680
Obviously, one, because she's
been through that crisis

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.560
and pretty much brokered
that deal, and two

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.980
because she throws in
political maneuvers.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.550
So it's hard to
tell what she thinks

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.696
is necessarily best for the
health of the financial system.

00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:27.080
Like she says, bank profits
are good, dividends are robust.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.890
They've got big tax
cuts, they should be

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.732
building their capital bunkers.

00:16:30.732 --> 00:16:32.487
So--

00:16:32.487 --> 00:16:33.320
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.520
But you mean it's hard
to tell where Sheila

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.948
is on Citicorp, for instance?

00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:39.490
STUDENT: Well, and
also the state of,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:45.930
like, how a lot of what she says
is the banks too big to fail.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:51.780
GARY GENSLER: So Sheila
Bair, who was to her core

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.300
as a Kansas Republican,
who worked for Senator Bob

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.230
Dole, who was then, when
she worked for him, majority

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.860
leader in the US Senate
on the Republican side,

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.190
is kind of a bit of
a prairie populist,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.170
if those terms mean
something to the class.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.890
And she got into the
role of running the FDIC

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.780
and saw early--

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.460
frankly a little
earlier than most--

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.140
that there was a
problem going on

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.300
in mortgage financing and credit
lending and the ease of credit

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.770
in the US.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.859
When the crisis
really hit hard, she

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.230
was part ultimately of the team.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.450
Not the head,
usually the Chairman

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.390
of the Federal Reserve, and
the Secretary of the Treasury.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.030
Or in any country, it's
usually the finance minister

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.100
and the head of the
central bank who

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.850
is somewhere in a war
room sort of setting,

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.270
literally, in crisis and rolling
conference calls and meetings

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.660
trying to sort through things.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.500
But Sheila was certainly
at that next level

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.340
in our multifaceted
regulatory system in the US.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.510
And I read her reading, and also
just knowing her personally--

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.850
I was with her last
Friday at a conference,

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.910
which I guess she arranged in
Washington about the crisis.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.000
I think her reading was
what Alpha's saying.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.490
I think it's-- but
you're correct,

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.910
she is a political actor
and is proud of that.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.350
I mean, that's her lifeblood and
where she's been for 30 years.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.860
But she's also deeply
a policy person

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.060
and tied to a sort of
populist vein in her--

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.830
she would have
probably preferred

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.420
to see Citi restructured or
taken over because of what

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.080
Alpha said, that there is
a quote "moral hazard,"

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.520
that the markets
might think, well

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.280
there's always going
to be a bailout waiting

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.990
for the largest of the banks.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.200
That would be the translation
of what she said there.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.910
Let me let me hit upon, so
what is the role of finance?

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.120
What's the central role
when we simplify all down

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.220
to its essence?

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.210
We have a dozen masters
of finance in here.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.880
So what are they teaching?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.780
And what's Andy Lowe teaching?

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.960
I don't know.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.870
Is anybody taking Andy's
intro class or no?

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.140
Nobody wants to tell
me the role of finance?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.560
Here, here we go.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.492
Are you a master
of finance student?

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.200
STUDENT: No, MBA.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.367
GARY GENSLER: You're an MBA.

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:24.540
Who's a master of finance?

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.640
Oh no!

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.810
All right.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.100
What's the role of finance?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.310
Very simple.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.920
It's like elevator stuff.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.510
STUDENT: I guess
it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:41.940
like different
functions of [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.880
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
intermediary, helps society.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.020
What's it intermediating?

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.306
The two things it intermediates?
[? M ?] finance students?

00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:54.060
STUDENT: They allocate
resources and also risk.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.620
GARY GENSLER:
Resources and risk.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.900
So they move,
allocate and price.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.770
Really importantly,
price allocate and move

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.650
money and risk.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.010
Just easy pictures.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.980
Money is something
of value and risk.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.230
And you will see this hourglass
on a whole bunch of slides

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.240
because I've thought about
finance for the whole 40 years

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.130
I've been around
it as an hourglass.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:24.070
Wall Street is sitting right
at the neck of the hourglass.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.720
Intermediaries.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.500
I thank-- what's your name?

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.620
What's that?

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.410
Joey.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.750
Intermediaries of financial
assets and liabilities.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.750
Because there's both sides
of the balance sheet.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.460
They can move around
assets or they

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.960
can move around
liabilities, again

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.900
at the neck of the hourglass.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.580
So what are the key
functions of finance?

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:53.100
I'm going to list four, but what
are the functions of finance?

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.450
As opposed to a role?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.110
Anybody else?

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.220
There were other hands up.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:56.905
Sure.

00:20:56.905 --> 00:20:58.080
STUDENT: Capital allocation.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.940
GARY GENSLER:
Capital allocation.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.998
I'll take that.

00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:02.915
It's not what I was
looking for but it's good.

00:21:02.915 --> 00:21:04.200
STUDENT: Market making.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.700
GARY GENSLER: Market making.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.570
Capital allocation,
market making.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.070
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.850
STUDENT: Payment.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.820
GARY GENSLER: Payment.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.350
STUDENT: Providing liquidity.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.860
GARY GENSLER:
Providing liquidity.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.110
I'm agreeing with all of them.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.527
You should have
written my slides.

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:18.290
I should revise the slides.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.680
So I say it's
basically investments,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.370
basically the store
of value, and credit--

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.390
in essence, borrowing value.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.630
Remember what money is.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.750
I know Ross is
looking at me like--

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.690
it's the two sides of--

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.420
we have this social
concept of money

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.380
that goes back
thousands of years.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.060
And at some point in time, what
if I want to store the value

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.410
or borrow the value?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.500
It's the two sides of the--

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.030
it's, again, centered
on a social construct.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.970
And thus, financial
intermediaries

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.180
sit right at the
neck of the hourglass

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.580
and transform risk as well.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.580
It could be a bank
that's transforming risk,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:10.550
short term deposits are then
lent or loaned out long.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.770
So right at the center
of the banking system,

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.630
the commercial banking system.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.540
Is what's called
maturity transformation--

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.620
short term deposits
versus long term lending.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.810
And it's not something
we're going to do away with.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.910
In fact, we should say,
that's a good thing.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.190
But because there's
maturity transformation,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.480
you can also have what's
known a run on the bank.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.070
What are the key sectors?

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.610
I'm going to throw a bit up
here, six or seven sectors.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.130
But what are the sectors
you think about as--

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.700
maybe some of you worked in?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.718
This is easy.

00:22:45.718 --> 00:22:46.510
STUDENT: Insurance.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.350
GARY GENSLER: Insurance, one.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.850
I don't remember your name.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:51.450
STUDENT: Ross.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:51.960
GARY GENSLER: Ross.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.280
STUDENT: Asset management.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.150
GARY GENSLER: Asset management.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.380
Insurance, asset management.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.450
Anton?

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.620
STUDENT: Banking broker.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.050
GARY GENSLER: Oh, that's two
sectors-- commercial banking

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.550
and brokers.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240
STUDENT: Private equity.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.448
GARY GENSLER: Private equity.

00:23:04.448 --> 00:23:06.430
I would call that
asset management.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.930
All right.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.550
So I put commercial banks.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.170
Sometimes in the US we have
7,000 or 8,000 credit unions

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.250
and 9,000 commercial banks.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.100
Investment banks
and brokerage firms.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.280
In Europe and many countries,
there are universal banks

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.530
and there are inside
commercial banks.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.590
But they perform a little
bit different function.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:29.580
Commercial banks think about
taking depositors' money

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.450
and then lending.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.580
The central thing
about commercial banks

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.620
is a credit allocation,
pricing of credit,

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.300
underwriting of credit.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.140
The center thing about
investment banks is about--

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.660
it still has underwriting,
but it's usually

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.250
related to market based, rather
than using their own balance

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.910
sheet, but market based
securities and brokerage.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.450
Insurance is a risk
transformation.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.870
I need to be covered if I
get into an auto accident.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.930
I need to be covered
if my house burns down.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:09.780
So thus I buy that insurance,
classic forms of insurance.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.060
And then all forms
of asset management

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.710
and collective
investment vehicles.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.210
I make it as two
different buckets,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.630
because a collective investment
vehicle is when you actually

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.420
put something into a
shared balance sheet,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.190
like a mutual fund.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.010
Asset managers are really
just getting paid a fee,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.910
but the two overlap.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.450
And of course all the
infrastructure of exchanges

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.810
and clearinghouses.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.820
It might end up employing a
quarter of you in one day,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.130
but I think about the
different sectors.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.650
When you're thinking about
use cases for blockchain,

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.390
it could be an any
one of these sectors,

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.780
in any one of these functions.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.980
Financial markets
or capital markets.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.035
What's the difference between
primary markets and secondary

00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:54.535
markets?

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.378
STUDENT: Kyle.

00:24:58.378 --> 00:24:59.170
GARY GENSLER: Kyle.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.060
STUDENT: Primary
markets was when

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.900
you issue a share
that's new to the world,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.280
like you bring a company public.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:06.520
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.230
I'm going to pause you there.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.890
Good answer.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.860
So Kyle says primary
market is when an issuer--

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.320
if I can add a word--

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.260
an issuer is issuing a
security for the first time

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.530
and receiving something of
value which we call money.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:21.474
That's primary.

00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:23.470
Primary because it's
the first issuance.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.250
What's the secondary market?

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.090
Hugo?

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.870
GARY GENSLER: Training
of those later.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.460
So primary markets,
secondary markets.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.370
It's relevant not only because
they have different market

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.078
structures and
different ecosystems,

00:25:43.078 --> 00:25:45.370
but they tend to have a little
bit different regulation

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.470
as well.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.040
Which has the higher
volume in the--

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.150
STUDENT: Secondary market.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.483
GARY GENSLER: Secondary markets.

00:25:53.483 --> 00:25:57.960
STUDENT: There are too many
issues [INAUDIBLE] the market.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:04.010
[INAUDIBLE] maybe
some interval issue.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.157
But [INAUDIBLE] it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:07.157 --> 00:26:08.740
GARY GENSLER: Well,
what's interesting

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.860
though, the secondary
markets have much more volume

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.120
than the primary markets.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.040
The ratio is not the
same market to market.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.270
Some markets, there's
a lot of profitability.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.020
If you're thinking
about finance and where

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.160
you can make your own
businesses and money,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.520
there's a lot of juice
in the primary market.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.630
There's a lot of activity
and various illiquid

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:33.000
or not tradable
secondary markets.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.940
Whereas like equity markets,
highly liquid equity markets,

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.950
all the action is in
the secondary market.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.460
Apple I don't think has
done any primary issuance

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.060
in well over a decade, maybe a
couple of decades in the equity

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.270
markets.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.870
But certainly the secondary
market for Apple stock

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.290
is quite robust.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.450
Whereas there's some
things that it's only

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.740
about the primary market.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.700
Alone, syndication is
really a primary market,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.360
and there's not a lot of
trading of secondary loans.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.567
So it's not all in one place.

00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:11.150
And again, when you're thinking
about use cases, that matters.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.270
Because is it high
volume or low volume?

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.620
Is there a lot of juice?

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.600
Juice is the margin of
profits to earnings.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.750
Non-technical term, sorry.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.570
I include in capital
markets the asset managers

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.510
that earn fees, the
BlackRocks and Fidelitys

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.530
or the small asset
managers, as well.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.190
And then all the
infrastructure-- the exchanges,

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:37.020
the clearinghouses and the like.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.090
So again, finance,
to sort of drill

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.600
back to where we were earlier,
have ledgers and payment

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.140
systems.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.980
Who's going to remind
me what a ledger is?

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.720
It's easy stuff.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.870
No.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.370
Ledgers.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.070
Wait, wait, no.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.990
STUDENT: It can
record transactions.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.607
Priya.

00:27:59.607 --> 00:28:00.440
GARY GENSLER: Priya.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.250
STUDENT: Record transactions.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.020
GARY GENSLER: A record
of transactions.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.730
I know you're tired
and you're quiet,

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.280
but if I were to
give you an exam,

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.260
one of the 20 questions I
would give you on vocabulary

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.260
is ledgers.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.720
Because ledgers matter to
blockchain, and blockchain

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.380
matters to ledgers.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.590
I'm not saying that there is no
use for blockchain technology

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.240
absent ledgers, but
I'm hard pressed

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.380
to think of a really good
use case within finance,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.310
at least, unless you have
some ledger, some recordation

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.560
of things of value.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.290
If you're keeping a
record of things of value,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.373
then the immutable
nature of blockchain

00:28:44.373 --> 00:28:45.290
becomes more relevant.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.823
If it's not things
of value, I'm just

00:28:51.823 --> 00:28:53.740
saying I'm a little bit
harder pressed to say,

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.620
well, you need the complexity
of this database structure.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.010
You could use other database
structures to keep it,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.190
even though Stuart Haber has
that wonderful blockchain

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.010
that's published in The New
York Times for notaries.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.990
So ledgers are records
of economic activity

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.290
and financial relationships.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.890
They are embedded in
every part of finance.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.690
Insurance companies
have ledgers,

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.480
investment banks have ledgers,
central banks have ledgers.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.810
They are embedded in every
part and they have been around

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.940
for thousands of
years, and they're

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.010
right at the center
of blockchain

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:32.240
because the UTXO set in
Bitcoin is a form of a ledger.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.400
And there's an account
based ledger in Etherium.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.150
What is a payment and
settlement system?

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.770
Anybody want to give it a shot?

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.530
Alpha I'm going to
move money to you.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.100
A payment system is moving
money from Gary to Alpha.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.230
You don't have to
answer this question.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:58.202
[? Kiera. ?] Payment system is
moving money from me to Alpha.

00:29:58.202 --> 00:29:58.910
What is it doing?

00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:04.950
It's transferring?

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.620
Good.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.330
Kelly?

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.150
STUDENT: I'm just going back to
our second class, but a method

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.470
to amend and report
the changes to letters?

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.770
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.880
I'm breaking it down.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.730
It is a transfer.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.230
But [? Keira ?] is
absolutely right.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.620
It's transferring
value from Gary--

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.480
from me to Alpha.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.470
But Kelly's right.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.570
It's amending two ledgers.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.140
It's going to amend the
ledger on my side negative

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.810
and hopefully amend
Alpha's positive.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.620
So it's amending and
recording ledgers.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.930
It's also-- these
systems, they have

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.450
to first authorize something.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.860
They have to do something
called clearing.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.940
And we're going to get to all
of these later in the semester.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.850
You might think, oh, that's
the boring stuff about finance.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.740
It's the back office.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.010
But authorizing,
clearing, recording.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.360
And the key word for
blockchain is final transfer.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.300
The reason blockchain
might have application

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:08.760
is it is a way to
finally move money.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.860
I don't mean finally
like over the centuries.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.520
I mean, if I were to move money
to Alpha through the US banking

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.760
system, it might not
move for several days.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.770
Blockchain is an application
that could have more immediacy.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:26.570
Final settlement.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.815
Finance and regulation.

00:31:27.815 --> 00:31:29.190
We talked a little
bit about this

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.290
when we were talking
about the readings,

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.170
but it's long been part
of public policy debates.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.320
This is not new.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.810
It's not just a post
financial crisis.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.660
It's not part of like the
post-industrial economies

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.600
of the globe.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.620
It has been true for
thousands of years.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.593
Sometime to the point that
people went to prison.

00:31:50.593 --> 00:31:52.260
Does anybody know
what debtor prison is?

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.725
Kyle or Priya?

00:31:58.725 --> 00:32:00.100
STUDENT: You would
basically have

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.980
to go to jail if you
didn't pay your debts off

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.563
in a certain amount of time, to
work off your debt [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:04.563 --> 00:32:05.692
be there.

00:32:05.692 --> 00:32:07.150
GARY GENSLER: So
Kyle is mentioning

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.925
that debtor prison
was that you literally

00:32:08.925 --> 00:32:11.050
had to go to jail if you
didn't pay off your debts.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.330
Do you know when that
went away in the US

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.900
or in Europe or in
China, in any country?

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.700
STUDENT: Disturbingly recently.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.682
GARY GENSLER:
Disturbingly recently?

00:32:21.682 --> 00:32:22.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.300
GARY GENSLER: No, I thought
it was 18th century.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.820
But you're saying you
think was 19th century.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.120
I haven't researched when
debtor prison finally went away.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.690
But so regulation also
is this horrible thought.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.540
What did we do when people
didn't pay their debts,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.300
and how bankruptcy
laws reflect--

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.070
because bankruptcy
laws are a social

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.880
construct, in essence,
that you don't go to jail,

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.080
but you have an opportunity
to work through those debts.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.420
I just highlight this
that it's not a new thing.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.330
Blockchain isn't the-- we
don't have regulation because

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.670
of blockchain, and
we don't necessarily

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.700
need a new set of regulations.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.340
Because finance is so
central to economies,

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.520
we've been grappling with
regulation for a long time.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.430
Now you saw this little
framework before,

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.150
but I restacked it.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.810
This is now the stack
I think of in terms

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:17.230
of financial regulation.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.120
Financial stability is first.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.980
And while you can't
see closely, this

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.770
is a bank run and
a wonderful picture

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.700
by Dorothea Lange called
"White Angel Bread Line."

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.030
But this is basically
financial stability

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:35.890
is probably the first and
foremost thing that regulation

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.040
around finance has been
for a couple of centuries.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.550
It's how do we make sure that
the banks have backing when

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.180
they take the money in house?

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.050
And how do we make sure that we
don't have a calamitous thing?

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:55.820
And even before Fiat currency,
well before Fiat currencies,

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:02.360
we had economic cycles
that had boom and bust.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.185
Like in the 17th century,
the tulip bulb craze--

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.550
the tulip bulbs in
Holland, I guess.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.750
But we also had incredible
boom and bust periods

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.250
around the South Sea,
the stock companies that

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.870
were being created over
exploration and so forth.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.760
Protecting the
public, just as we've

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:34.489
talked about in blockchain, I
would say that non-blockchain,

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.653
there's a lot more emphasis
on consumer protection,

00:34:37.653 --> 00:34:41.429
a tremendous amount of emphasis
on consumer protection.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.100
Of course, we've talked
about investor protection

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.210
and so forth.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.489
The illicit activity
conversation

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:51.780
we've had all around blockchain
is important around finance,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.250
but it's not the leading--

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.820
it's not the tip of the spear.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.360
It's not where this
debate has been

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.690
over the decades or centuries.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:05.310
It's frankly more something
in the last 30 or 40 years.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:09.510
As money has moved to
digitized electronic means,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:14.060
governments have
stood up more emphasis

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.730
on any money laundering
laws, Bank Secrecy Act

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.260
laws and the like.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.160
But if you look at the
history of like 19th century

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.068
or early 20th century
financial regulation,

00:35:28.068 --> 00:35:29.610
there was a little
bit about guarding

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.680
against illicit activity.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.590
But by and large, most of
the regulatory regimes--

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:40.830
even in the 1930s, during the
financial crisis of its time,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.630
the Great Depression, most
of it was about bank runs,

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.490
shoring up the banking system,
standing up deposit insurance

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.450
and protecting the investors.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:58.450
And it was this concept of money
laundering and so forth was--

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:02.770
it's when we move
from physical forms

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:08.210
of cash to electronic forms
that you found more of that.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.810
Yes, please.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.000
STUDENT: In a public
policy discussion,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.780
how is financial
stability defined?

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.620
Is it like more inflation?

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.370
GARY GENSLER: That's
a very good question.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.412
Remember your first name?

00:36:18.412 --> 00:36:19.356
Jihee.

00:36:19.356 --> 00:36:21.860
Jihee is asking, is
financial stability

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.070
about inflation or otherwise?

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.030
It does include inflation, but
financial stability is broader.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:37.580
In essence, it's the thought
of, does the financial system

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.960
lead to instability
in the economy?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.110
And what is true, again,
for probably a couple

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.420
of thousand years, but the
research that you can read--

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.920
Ken Rogoff's book.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.490
I don't know if any of you have
ever read Ken Rogoff's book.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.220
It was a wonderful book
about the history of crises

00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:00.050
and economic cycles that
came out 4 to 6 years ago,

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:01.820
and I could get
you the name of it.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:12.140
But finance adds to and
leads to booms and busts.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.410
Booms and busts existed
well before Fiat currency

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.500
and banking, but there's
booms and busts in the cycle.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.240
And so financial
stability, in essence,

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.320
is trying to smooth out
the cycles you would say.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.200
Central banks came
along initially

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.870
in the late 17th century.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.930
But then, by the
early 20th century,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.950
most nations had central banks
as a check on the sovereign

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.930
in terms of currency.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.300
And that's where, Jihee your
question about inflation.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.380
So if the sovereign
can deflate--

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:50.130
if the currency could be
devalued through inflation,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.140
that can lead to instability.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.620
But it's all forms
of instability,

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.220
particularly because leverage
is at the center of finance.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.910
Leverage meaning that a
financial institution's assets

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:03.896
are what?

00:38:03.896 --> 00:38:06.120
What are financial
intermediaries' assets?

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.842
If you look at a balance sheet--

00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:12.820
Eilon?

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:14.050
STUDENT: Loans.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.450
GARY GENSLER: Loans.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.180
Brotish?

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.435
STUDENT: Deposits?

00:38:19.435 --> 00:38:22.060
GARY GENSLER: Well, deposits are
usually on the liability side.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.875
But [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:24.645
STUDENT: Capital?

00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:26.140
GARY GENSLER: Capital.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.980
You mean capital
and somebody else?

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.683
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:38:28.683 --> 00:38:30.100
GARY GENSLER: All
right, one more.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.892
I mean, loans-- these
are all good answers.

00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:32.462
Anton?

00:38:32.462 --> 00:38:34.347
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:35.430
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.426
STUDENT: The security
they're investing in.

00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:40.360
GARY GENSLER: The
securities-- investments.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.820
The difference between a
commercial balance sheet,

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.550
or a non-financial balance sheet
and a financial balance sheet,

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.680
easy to figure this out.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.120
Commercial balance sheets
have physical assets.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.620
They own plants, equipment.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.580
In the old days--

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.650
I mean, now it's
intangible assets,

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:01.180
like movies and
software development.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.640
But and a financial
balance sheet,

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.920
almost all financial
balance sheets you look at,

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.990
all their assets are
other financial assets.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.440
A loan is a financial asset, a
security is a financial asset,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.370
a deposit is a security--
they're assets.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.800
They have a little bricks and
mortar, maybe a little bit

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.830
of goodwill or
intellectual property,

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.830
and a lot of other
financial assets.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.830
And they're-- the right hand
side of the balance sheet is

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.455
a bunch of liabilities and
a little bit of capital.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.895
And so they're levered.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.930
And that leads to instability.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.430
Finance and technology.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:49.540
I contend finance has long been
in a symbiotic relationship

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.270
with technology.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.020
It just depends on the
technology of its time.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.600
Blockchain is just
in that long history.

00:39:58.137 --> 00:39:59.220
And we've talked about it.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.280
Money started looking like this.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.060
We've sort of gone
down this path.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.070
Then technology came along,
and it could look like this.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.520
But it's all technological
evolution, or at times

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:21.210
revolution, that we went
from that to paper money.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.520
Now sometimes
technology veers off

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.360
and we have private bank
notes instead of Fiat notes

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.120
and so forth.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.960
But it's just forms
of technology.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.440
And the modern
money, Fiat currency,

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.060
is just another evolution in
technology and regulation.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.920
So that's why I'm
saying it's sort of--

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.230
finance, regulation,
and technology all

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:48.200
have this symbiotic
bit together,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.810
from debtor prison
to where we are now.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.800
And thankfully, we don't
have debtor prison.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.378
Yes?

00:40:55.378 --> 00:40:55.920
STUDENT: Yes.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.940
[INAUDIBLE] a
consequence of reading

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.230
the readings for today's class.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:04.030
I was kind of thinking
that maybe it's

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:09.190
the very nature of the financial
market and its configuration.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:13.280
Big companies with very
high barriers of entry,

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.390
because of the regulation
and the substantial capital

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:21.680
requirements, that their
relationship with technology

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.240
innovation has been that
fluid in the recent years up

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.550
until the recent showing
of FinTech startups.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:35.110
Because there's a certain
sense of complacency,

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.860
in the sense that
they've been approaching

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:37.880
technology innovation.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.840
You see current incumbents--

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.720
and I was surprised by kind of
noticing the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.740
here in the United States.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:51.740
Big banks still use
really old legacy systems.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.840
And they can innovate,
but incrementally.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.260
They put the brand new
mobile application--

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.190
GARY GENSLER: So Eric--

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.100
I think Eric's raising
at least three points,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.270
but maybe there's four or
five and I missed some.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:10.220
That concept that,
yes, finance has always

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.030
been about
technology, but do you

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.570
think something's accelerated
in the last period of time?

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.270
That it's even more
about technology?

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.290
That's Point 1.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:26.060
Point 2 is, they seem to
be slow at adaptation,

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.980
that the really
kind of lumbering

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.600
of the bunch of legacy systems.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.950
And they're slow.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.420
Those were the two main points.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.190
Maybe there's a third or fourth.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.120
I would concur,
though I wouldn't

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.690
overemphasize the first.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:48.890
They had to grapple with what it
meant when the telegraph wires

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.780
came and the telephones came.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.240
I mean, maybe not in the same--

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.990
maybe it has accelerated,
but there's still--

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.010
and it's said that--

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.530
they said that the people that
did the best in the London

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:08.990
Stock Exchange about 200 years
ago, the Battle of Waterloo

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.510
happened.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.510
Does anybody know where
the Battle of Waterloo--

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.980
I mean, it's before me too.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.290
I wasn't around then.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.830
Thank you.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.110
Is that good?

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:17.807
What's that?

00:43:17.807 --> 00:43:19.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] in Belgium.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.210
GARY GENSLER: In Belgium.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.770
But who was the great general?

00:43:22.505 --> 00:43:25.320
STUDENT: Washington?

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.600
GARY GENSLER: Wellington.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.290
So it's said that Lord
Wellington sent carrier pigeons

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.160
back to London.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.470
This is supposedly a real story.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.930
Those carrier pigeons
carried the information,

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.900
and the traders in London
who got the carrier pigeons

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.720
traded before others
knew the results.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.190
The carrier pigeons, in a
sense, were the technology

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.690
at the time.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.970
So I'm just saying the
intersection of technology

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:55.430
and finance, particularly for
those who have the best carrier

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.850
pigeon, it works.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.590
Now I used to use
this story sometimes

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.635
at hearings, when high
frequency traders would

00:44:02.635 --> 00:44:04.760
be coming in front of the
Commodity Futures Trading

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.520
Commission.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.760
And they'd go, oh, the
chairman is going to pull out

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.890
his carrier pigeon story again.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.620
And they said, please don't
call a high frequency trader

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.940
a carrier pigeon company.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.420
But my point is is, I
think you're right, Eric.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.990
I think it's accelerated, but
it's not that it wasn't-- and I

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.760
do think that the big incumbents
are sometimes slow to adapt,

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:32.160
and that's part of the
opportunity of blockchain.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.590
Blockchain may not be better
than what they're doing,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.010
but blockchain might be
the tool of a disruptor

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.820
to get someplace that
the incumbents are too

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.520
invested in their current
legacy system to get there.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.280
So it might be that
opportunity to get

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.040
underneath what they're doing.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:49.540
Eilon.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.600
STUDENT: Are you talking
about building a bank that's

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.600
built on blockchain as
an opportunity to disrupt

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.475
the banking industry?

00:44:55.475 --> 00:44:59.130
Or using the blockchain within
the activities [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.138
GARY GENSLER: Well,
see, that's not

00:45:01.138 --> 00:45:02.430
a question I'm going to answer.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.430
You all get to answer that
in your final projects.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:09.150
And I suspect you're
going to be narrower--

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.300
if your project is, disrupt
and build a whole bank,

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.490
I look forward to
reading the project.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:18.160
But I suspect you're going to
be a little bit more targeted,

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.780
and that the most
successful opportunities,

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.730
to the extent any
will be successful--

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.830
and most will fail--

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.470
but to the extent
any are successful,

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.620
my hunch will be more
targeted than that.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.970
But I leave it to the
creative minds in this class.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.890
Fiat currency
we've talked about.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.750
It's a liability of
commercial banks.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.710
It's central banks.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.320
It's accepted for
taxes and legal tender.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.830
I do this in terms
for repetition.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.390
Because if this is a
class today about finance,

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:53.640
I can't do it without
talking about Fiat currency.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.180
And yes, it relies on
a system of ledgers.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:57.908
Sorry.

00:45:57.908 --> 00:45:58.950
Had to get that in there.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.130
But ledgers at the
central bank, that

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.370
has an entry that-- there's
9,000 commercial banks

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:05.980
in the US.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.813
I don't mean to leave
out any other country,

00:46:07.813 --> 00:46:10.140
but the form and
fashion is the same.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.230
If there's 600 commercial
banks in the UK,

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.530
and I don't know the number,
or there's 1,000 in China,

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.750
it's always sort
of that same thing.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.890
One big ledger at the central
bank and then every bank,

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.800
commercial bank, has
a reserve account,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.290
and that reserve account
is on the master ledger

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.820
at the central bank in essence.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.400
So this is just some of
the technology of ledgers,

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.680
from the proto cuneiform.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.870
The IBM 360 in 1961
revolutionized finance.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:49.050
And IBM was not only the
best disruptor company,

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:52.050
but it was
revolutionizing finance.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:56.310
That IBM 360 really started to
get adopted in a lot of finance

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.450
in the 1970s.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.117
In the 1960s, there was
the paperwork problem.

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:01.950
The New York Stock
Exchange had to shut down

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.710
for a couple of days in the late
'60s, because they basically

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.690
had too much paper.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:10.530
Physical limitations
for finance.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.930
Payment and settlement
systems have come a long way.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.080
That's Thomas Jefferson
writing a check to himself.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.280
But a check from Thomas
Jefferson to himself in 1809

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.490
was a form to change
two ledger accounts.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.510
Telex, believe it or
not, there was still

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.150
some telex machines when
I started at Goldman Sachs

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.560
in 1979.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.200
I was 6.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.380
I was 21.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.470
But telex machines were
a very big innovation

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.990
in the 1950s that allowed
for the communication

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.830
and sending around.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:52.230
Now they're overcome by the
important technologies later.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.010
All of these technologies
were before the big boom

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:59.010
and what I'll call
encryptography,

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.140
and how to secure
communications,

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.140
and the whole form of public
key and private key cryptography

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.700
and other forms of
cryptography, all of which

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.498
are used in banking
today pre blockchain.

00:48:11.498 --> 00:48:13.290
Almost everything that's
done in blockchain

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.210
has some form of
cryptography that's

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.490
being used for it and with it.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:22.410
So blockchain, in a sense, is
just possibly a new technology

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:26.010
using cryptography and
using databases and doing it

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.010
in a different way.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:32.160
And the question is, can we can
we find use cases in finance

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.210
through that?

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:37.000
So what are some of
the technologies today?

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.670
And this is not
a fintech course.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.320
If it was a fintech
course, every one

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.870
of the things that are
going to go on this slide

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.940
would be talked about.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.440
But does anybody want to just
have some fun and name what's

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.540
going on in fintech world?

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.970
Blockchain is one of the eight
things I'm going to list.

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.210
Anybody want to do
some guesses here?

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.386
STUDENT: AI.

00:48:55.386 --> 00:48:56.553
GARY GENSLER: All right, AI.

00:48:56.553 --> 00:48:57.767
Jihee.

00:48:57.767 --> 00:48:58.600
STUDENT: Biometrics.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.642
GARY GENSLER: Biometrics.

00:48:59.642 --> 00:49:01.470
We've got two of the eight.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:02.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
open banking.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.140
GARY GENSLER: Oh good, banking.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:04.380
Good.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.340
We have three of the eight.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.030
This is good.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.280
I want to see how we're going.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.220
Daniel, thank you.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.390
STUDENT: Big data.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.540
GARY GENSLER: Big data.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.040
All right.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.615
That's not-- yes, yes.

00:49:12.615 --> 00:49:13.490
I'm agreeing with it.

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:14.680
I didn't put it up there.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.050
What's that?

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:16.700
RPI?

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.060
STUDENT: RPA.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:18.810
GARY GENSLER: RPA.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.435
You want to tell the
class what RPA is?

00:49:20.435 --> 00:49:22.170
STUDENT: Robotic
Processing Automation.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.460
GARY GENSLER: Yes, Robotic
Processing Automation.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.650
Hugo?

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:26.310
No?

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.577
Oh, [INAUDIBLE] taken.

00:49:29.577 --> 00:49:30.660
STUDENT: Machine learning.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.510
GARY GENSLER: Machine
learning, yes.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:36.180
All right, so AI, machine
learning, blockchain.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.480
Nobody said cloud, because
now you all sort of take cloud

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.490
for granted.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.940
And so maybe cloud shouldn't
even be on this page.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.500
But it's still sort of
changing some, open API.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.175
I'm sorry?

00:49:47.175 --> 00:49:50.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] we
have a lot of revelations

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.500
about putting data on the cloud.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:58.350
At least in Brazil, we
cancel any data [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.120
And we just can't put--

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.130
GARY GENSLER: So
you're saying that--

00:50:02.545 --> 00:50:03.420
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.878
We do have a cloud,
a private cloud

00:50:04.878 --> 00:50:08.512
that we use, but it's
not not the same as--

00:50:08.512 --> 00:50:10.470
GARY GENSLER: So Leonardo
is saying, in Brazil,

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:13.195
you can't put certain
information on the cloud.

00:50:13.195 --> 00:50:14.820
That's probably true
of many countries.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.480
It's certain information.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.870
But a lot of bank
information, a lot

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.910
of financial information
in most countries

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.130
are now up in the cloud.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:24.630
10 years ago it wasn't.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.600
So it's still sort of
shifting, and probably but

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.050
country by country,
jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.070
And I suspect, in
a lot of countries,

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:36.660
the official sector doesn't
even know what's in the cloud.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.950
And then the other,
biometrics are mentioned.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.970
Interestingly, nobody mentioned
chat bots, one of my favorites.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:44.970
But chat bots is a
big piece of what's

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:48.490
going on in finance
and so forth.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.640
You don't like chat bots, Hugo?

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.320
How many people like chat bots?

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.550
Can I see a show of hands?

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.490
So what is it that
you like about--

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.895
Tom, what do you
like about chat bots?

00:51:00.895 --> 00:51:03.910
STUDENT: If I'm going to go
through a robotic system,

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.890
whether it's like an
automated press button,

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:08.015
I would rather go through
the automated system that

00:51:08.015 --> 00:51:09.120
gives me the answer.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.640
[INAUDIBLE] until I
end up [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.640
GARY GENSLER: Eric, you
said you like chat bots?

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.557
STUDENT: Yeah, but not
from the customer side,

00:51:17.557 --> 00:51:18.907
but from the other side.

00:51:18.907 --> 00:51:19.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:20.530
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.660
From the customer
side, how many people

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.990
really kind of don't
like chat bots?

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.490
Right?

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:28.850
I mean, it's not a great
customer experience.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.610
But maybe that's
where somebody is

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.770
going to spend a lot
of technology and money

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.340
and ingenuity and
some Sloan MIT group

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.880
will solve that, that it's a
better customer experience.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.070
Just an observation
for anybody listening

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.540
if this film is ever seen.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.550
Credit.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.770
Let me just [INAUDIBLE] say.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:49.960
What's credit?

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.600
I earlier already defined this.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.180
But what is credit?

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.910
It's basically borrowing
something of value,

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:57.710
but importantly,
with an agreement

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.640
to give it back later.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.020
As old as time can be.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.280
It probably goes back
20,000, 30,000 years.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.140
Some of the earliest
writing is about what it is.

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.760
But here's a chart about
US private and public debt

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.380
as a percentage of GDP.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.650
It's based on the
Federal Reserve numbers.

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:19.780
I got a chart--

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:20.830
I looked hard for this--

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:22.450
140 year chart.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.770
And if you can't see it, we are
currently-- the debt in the US

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.620
is about 350% of our economy.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.980
Our economy is $20
trillion, and debt totals

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.570
around $70 trillion.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:38.530
Just easy, easy
math for these days.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:39.340
When did it peak?

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:45.880
The last time was
in 1929 at 300%.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.580
We zipped past 300%.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.590
We had the 2008 crisis.

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:54.403
It's sort of been
coming back down.

00:52:54.403 --> 00:52:56.570
I'm not suggesting we're
going come all the way back

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:58.700
down 140%.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.990
But I raise this chart to
say, debt in modern economies

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:06.830
is a big part of
how economies work.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.470
The US total credit market--

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.970
now those are the slices.

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:14.540
Government, commercial,
financial, household.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.978
Each about one fourth in the US.

00:53:16.978 --> 00:53:19.520
It would break out a little bit
different in other countries,

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.130
of course.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.320
And then here's
the US bond market.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.550
Now, the US bond market
is only about $40 trillion

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.350
and the debt market is $67.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.440
What's the difference
between those two?

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.330
What's that?

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:36.840
So this the bond market.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.550
That's the credit market.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:42.830
So all of that government
debt is in the bond market,

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:46.700
but a lot of the commercial
debt is bank loans.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.510
And you're right.

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:51.840
A lot of the household paper
is also then securitized.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.840
So you've got to get rid of
some of the double counting.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.110
And there's all sorts of
questions of double counting

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:58.740
and so forth.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.890
$40 trillion bond market.

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:04.140
But the total is
closer to $70 trillion

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.130
by Federal Reserve statistics.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:08.880
I thought it'd be just
interesting to say,

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.870
what's the bond and equity
markets around the globe?

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:18.810
Our bond and equity markets
combined are about 360%

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.370
of our economy.

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.660
The EU and China, you can see--

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.040
now, that might mean that
we have an overvalued stock

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.590
market.

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.450
Our stock market right
now is about 30--

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.540
well, today it might
not be as good.

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.300
But it's hovering
around $30 trillion.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:36.510
I think it was up to
$32 or $33 trillion.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.590
Has is it done
poorly today again?

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:40.090
Yeah.

00:54:42.878 --> 00:54:43.920
But it gives you a sense.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.800
It's not just the US that
are about these numbers.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.580
This is how financing of
non-financial corporations

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.000
in the four big jurisdictions.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.020
The US is far more
securities-focused,

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.320
meaning we have very
well-developed bond and equity

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.610
markets.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.480
And loans, as you can see,
only provide about 11% or 12%

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.810
of funding for commercial--

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.630
if you're a small company,
you get your borrowings

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:13.260
from a bank.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.120
If you're a big company, you go
out in the securities market.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:16.620
James?

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.453
STUDENT: Are these
publicly traded companies

00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:20.110
or just any company?

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.920
GARY GENSLER: I didn't
do the research.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.960
SIFMA, which is a securities
industry association,

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.090
puts out a report
annually and I grabbed

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.740
these from the SIFMA report
that came out two weeks ago.

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:33.763
So I could look at the
report, but I don't know.

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:35.430
I think it's more
than public companies.

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:40.575
I think this is
broadly the economy--

00:55:40.575 --> 00:55:41.950
I'm not going to
go through this.

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.760
But I have two slides here--
one is the equity market, one

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:50.230
the bond market-- to say,
the holders of US bonds,

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.160
pretty diverse.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.220
But it's a lot of other
financial companies.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.500
Who holds bonds?

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.840
It's a lot of other
financial companies.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.450
Whereas equities is households.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.400
It's either household--
directly a household

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.110
through a mutual
fund or a household

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:07.830
through their pension.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.750
Now only 40% is direct.

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:15.580
About 1/3 is through mutual
funds and about 12% or 15%

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.720
is through pension funds.

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:23.360
But it's kind of households own
a lot of the equity and finance

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.760
firms own a bunch of the debt.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.330
Rough, rough guidance.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.070
Any of you masters
of finance, you

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.530
can tell me if I'm
going off the rails.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:41.420
And also, a household debt-- and
then I'll stop with the slides.

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:45.040
Household debt is
primarily mortgage debt.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.030
The orange on here is
all the mortgage debt.

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:50.240
We're out about $9
trillion in mortgage debt.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:56.360
But red-- red is what you
all probably identify with.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.640
You don't have to self tell
me, but you're probably

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.450
all in the red.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.040
That's the student debt.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.290
Student debt in the US is
now $1.5 trillion dollars.

00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:08.270
And I'm just expressing my
own public policy perspective,

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:09.770
but it's not--

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:14.210
I don't think it's good to
mortgage everybody who's

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:17.690
just going through college
and graduate school.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:19.610
But that's a bigger
public policy debate,

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:23.330
and I'm just expressing
a point of view.

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:26.165
It did not used to be like this.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.250
Here's an interesting chart to
me is the number of accounts.

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:36.670
Again, US, we could have
gotten broader countries.

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:42.100
There's 500 million
credit cards in the US.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:46.420
There's 328 million
Americans, and about 1 and--

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.860
1.6, 1.7 per population.

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:56.260
But auto loans and mortgages,
which are the left access,

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.310
are 70 or 80 million.

00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:59.600
So these are big markets.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.050
These are just numbers of
people who have an auto

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:04.000
loan or a number of auto loans.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.060
These are numbers of mortgages.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.510
And then HE is Home
Equity, revolving.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:16.400
These are the four big slip
streams of household debt.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.980
Mortgage is number one.

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.340
Student debt, number
two, unfortunately.

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:26.840
Credit cards and
then home equity.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.190
And auto loans are--

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:33.090
I can't see on this chart, but
auto loans are behind them.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.110
Let's talk about risk.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:39.210
This is a couple of ideas from
my time in risk management.

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:41.760
Anybody want to give me the
three big risks, if you were

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.390
managing Goldman Sachs, you'd be
worried about on a daily basis?

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:49.830
Not whether the euro is going to
crash, but broad topical risk.

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:52.820
What are the three
or four big risks?

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.000
Addy?

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
STUDENT: Market risk.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.503
GARY GENSLER: Market risk.

00:58:57.503 --> 00:58:59.170
STUDENT: Credit risk
and operating risk.

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:00.170
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:02.490
Market risk, credit
risk, operations.

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:03.955
Any others?

00:59:03.955 --> 00:59:05.080
STUDENT: Counterparty risk.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.910
GARY GENSLER: Counterparty risk.

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.960
STUDENT: Human capital.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.127
GARY GENSLER: Human capital.

00:59:09.127 --> 00:59:09.920
That's a good one.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.420
I like it.

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.450
It's usually not taken up
in a risk committee though.

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.600
It's an important risk though,
but it's not usually taken up.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.350
So what do I have?

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.502
Market risk.

00:59:18.502 --> 00:59:19.960
All sorts of
different market risk.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.390
Credit and underwriting.

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:24.610
Credit is, will
somebody pay me back?

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:27.580
Underwriting is usually,
have I judged the risk well?

00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.710
So it could be an
insurance risk as well as

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:33.360
underwriting securities.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.670
Three things I didn't
hear from you all.

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.870
I'm not surprised I
didn't hear, but these are

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:43.110
the three that lead to crises.

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:45.960
Market risk, credit risk
and underwriting risk.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.510
Even if firms blow it,
they usually do it.

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:53.450
And usually the board of
directors understands it.

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:56.690
My experience in
looking at failed firms,

00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:59.090
it's liquidity funding
and settlement risk.

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:02.690
Liquidity means,
can I sell something

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:05.540
when I want to sell it?

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.560
Or can I buy a hedge or
cover when I want to cover?

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.930
Funding is, can I
roll over my funding?

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:14.810
Because so much of finance
is about short term funding

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:17.270
and long term assets.

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:19.490
And it's usually
misunderstanding

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.150
liquidity in a crisis.

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:26.660
You can sell things all day
long when things are good.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:32.210
But when markets start
to get frail and thin,

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:34.730
your liquidity dries up.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.800
So it's a crazy thing to model.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.030
It's a very tough thing.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:42.113
I mean, great economists, great
finance academics can model it.

01:00:42.113 --> 01:00:44.030
But at the end of the
day, it's a little tough

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:47.130
because it goes away fast.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.630
And it's kind of a funny
mathematical formula when

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:52.843
you see something just go away.

01:00:52.843 --> 01:00:54.010
And the math doesn't matter.

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:57.850
When you can't sell something,
and you think it was worth $98,

01:00:57.850 --> 01:00:59.290
and you can't sell it for $88.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.530
And the other big one is
model risk or correlations.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.790
And you can build a
correlation matrix

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.850
around all sorts of
financial assets,

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.310
and it can work in most markets.

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:17.640
It can work in a market which
I'll say out to two or three

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.500
standard deviations
from the norm.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.232
But will your
correlation matrix still

01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:23.190
work when you're in a
market environment that's

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:26.080
four or five standard
deviations out from the norm?

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.580
I'm sorry.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:30.270
Think of a bell shaped
curve, and just think of--

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.280
some people call it tail risk.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.930
But I'm not talking
about the price.

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:37.110
I'm talking about all your
correlations in your model,

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.440
just throw them out the window.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.560
And those four-- liquidity,
funding, and settlement

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.490
and correlation,
in my experience

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:50.100
is kind of where firms get
into a bunch of trouble.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:50.730
Or they're not.

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:53.190
Maybe it's not actually
a bug but it's a feature.

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.500
It's sort of saying, I'm
embedding all this risk.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.640
This is why I'm earning excess
returns when I'm in finance.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.460
And 1 in 100 times, my
firm's going to go bankrupt.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.190
But that's just--
that's the risk I take.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.690
Kelly?

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.184
STUDENT: I know we're
going to talk about this

01:02:08.184 --> 01:02:10.142
in the next unit, but
can you talk a little bit

01:02:10.142 --> 01:02:15.492
about how well stress testing
within banks addresses these?

01:02:15.492 --> 01:02:16.200
GARY GENSLER: OK.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.870
So I've got operation
and cyber risk.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:21.180
It would have been
operational in the past,

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.400
and now everybody's
all focused on cyber.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.570
And it's the right thing.

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.570
It's a big risk the banks and
insurance companies are all

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:28.740
focused on.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.140
Legal and compliance
and reputational risk.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.110
Literally, if you went
back 30 years ago,

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.930
people would not be managing
reputational, legal risk

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.730
at their risk committee.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.980
But a well-run risk
committee at a big bank

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.313
takes all these things--
every one of these categories

01:02:43.313 --> 01:02:44.730
should go up to
the risk committee

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.680
in some way or another.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.985
Dan and then I'm going to
try to do Kelly's question.

01:02:48.985 --> 01:02:50.610
STUDENT: Of course
this isn't something

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.860
that a company could
control, but can you

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.280
talk about political
risks in kind of context?

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.793
It might impact--

01:02:58.793 --> 01:03:00.210
GARY GENSLER:
Generally speaking--

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.752
Dan just asked about
political risk--

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:08.037
classic sort of thinking is
that you don't manage that

01:03:08.037 --> 01:03:08.870
at a risk committee.

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.620
You might manage it in
your Washington or Brussels

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.470
or London office dealing with--

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.740
and there's policy risk,
that the policies can change,

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.450
the regulations can change.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:25.850
You try to influence it
and get ahead of changes

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:28.097
that lower your profit margins.

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:30.680
But you usually aren't going to
be managing it in the same way

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:30.920
here.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.972
So Dan, you're right.

01:03:31.972 --> 01:03:32.930
There's political risk.

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:37.460
There's a second thing,
which is expropriation risk.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.030
In many countries, it's
no longer a big challenge.

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.410
But it is.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:44.900
And certainly, for
big banks, there

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:50.030
is a lot of expropriation
risk in earlier decades.

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.660
Crises.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.510
You can see the hourglass
is kind of broken,

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:57.830
and it's broken right at
the neck where finance is.

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.900
Here's some just--

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:04.890
I hate to say it, but in my
memory, I hope all of you

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:08.370
have such a rich career
that in 30 or 40 years

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.740
you can be teaching
somewhere like MIT

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.480
but you will have this.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.000
No matter what
country you live in,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.670
you will have some
list that you can--

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.380
I didn't go to Wikipedia.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.230
I just said, oh, yeah, there
was that Latin debt crisis.

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.720
I did go to the internet to
remind myself what years.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.150
And in the 1970s, I
was in high school.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:30.060
But I'm just saying
that, I actually

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.980
remember all of these crises.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.850
They happen.

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.485
They come, they go,
they're part of it.

01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:38.860
Let me just mention something
about the subprime mortgage

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.110
crisis 2008.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:44.020
So what's my quick take on it?

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.210
Like what happened?

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:49.200
You know, in 10 minutes or less.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.050
But I'll take any questions.

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:57.220
One, I think at the core were
weak underwriting practices,

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.870
mostly in the real estate
sector for housing.

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:03.780
Underwriting is the word--

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.790
a bank is making a loan,
or an insurance company

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:07.870
is taking a risk.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.820
It's whenever
somebody takes a risk,

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:15.730
you have to sort of make
some probability weighting.

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:17.110
What's that risk like?

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.470
Let's take a bank.

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:20.020
Will I get repaid?

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.690
You're not going to get
repaid 100% of the loans,

01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:26.410
but underwriting is this concept
of sort of sorting that out.

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.060
Or in insurance,
the underwriting

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.360
risk of a house burning
down and so forth.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.580
There were weak
underwriting standards.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.950
And, on top of it, a lot of
bad practices and predatory

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:38.450
lending.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:39.118
Kyle?

01:05:39.118 --> 01:05:40.160
STUDENT: Just a question.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.687
Do you think that the
predatory lending and accepting

01:05:43.687 --> 01:05:45.770
loans when maybe you won't
be able to pay it back,

01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:49.970
as well as extending
loans, is a symptom

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:53.600
of willingness to
take on more risk

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.440
or being unaware of the
risk that you're taking?

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.200
GARY GENSLER: So Kyle
raises sort of a-- whatever

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.590
you want to call it-- the
$64,000 question in the middle

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:07.550
of bad risk management.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:11.300
I mean, because we could
go back to this page.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.420
Every one of these
pieces of risk management

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.730
you can't do perfectly.

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:21.000
It's only so susceptible
to higher math.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.270
Every one of these,
there's math around.

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:29.620
But poor risk management
can be just not even

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.050
being aware that
the risk is there.

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:34.420
I think that's what
your question was like.

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:39.280
Was there just an unawareness
that there were such bad things

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.830
going on in the street?

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:44.680
Or was it-- well,
we're aware of it

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.230
but we're willing
to take that risk?

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:49.970
I think it was a bit of both.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:54.078
I think that the major
investment banks--

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:55.870
the Lehman Brothers
and some of the others,

01:06:55.870 --> 01:07:00.460
they were underwriting a lot
of the subprime mortgages--

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:05.590
were aware that there
were no doc loans.

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:06.640
No document loans.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.320
It was called no doc loans.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.760
That the down payments
were shrinking.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.220
Because that was susceptible
to math, that you could see

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.110
there was lower and
lower down payments.

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:20.410
But I don't think that
they knew everything

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:23.950
that was going on the street,
the really bad action.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:28.090
I testified in the US Congress
in the spring of 2000,

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:32.320
as the Secretary,
Undersecretary, about predatory

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.760
lending.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.350
It wasn't that I was prescient.

01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:38.230
I was asked to testify.

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:40.958
And we did a big study between
the Department of Housing

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:42.250
and the Department of Treasury.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:42.917
And we went out.

01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:46.120
We had public hearings
in a bunch of cities,

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.490
and we wrote a report
and made recommendations.

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:52.060
And Ned Gramlich over
at the Federal Reserve

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.350
was very helpful.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:56.070
Andrew Cuomo at the
Department of Housing,

01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:58.540
who is now governor
of New York, and I

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:01.960
was running point at Treasury.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.960
So it was known, in a sense.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.660
But I think a lot of the broad
community, the policy community

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.660
and the banking community,
tended to look the other way.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.430
Partly because there
were so much profits

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:19.899
and partly because, in
the upside of a boom,

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:24.270
it feels like it's
never going to turn,

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.029
and that that even
a small report like

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:30.630
we did in the spring of 2000--

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:35.220
in fairness, we didn't bang
the table enough maybe.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.819
There I was testifying, and
I left, and that was that.

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:40.319
You know?

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:44.819
Al Gore is running to
succeed Bill Clinton.

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:49.470
The administration couldn't
have gotten a law changed,

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:51.420
even if we tried at that time.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.540
But nonetheless, that's-- so
I think sometimes it's a bit

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:58.700
of both, from
personal experience.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.310
But back to the crisis.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:04.760
So I think that weak
underwriting and predatory

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.810
lending mixed in to have
a subprime mortgage crisis

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.319
and then a big housing bubble.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.300
But also beyond that--

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.399
beyond that, easy credit.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:19.170
Easy credit partly because
interest rates were so low.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:22.870
We came out of the
late part, the 1990s.

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:25.450
We went from an asset
bubble in the stock market,

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:27.729
the internet bubble
burst, and we kind of

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:34.120
moved that bubble valuation
into the housing market.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.010
The Federal Reserve
lowered interest rates,

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:39.700
kept interest rates low for a
very long time to kind of keep

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.620
the economy going.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:47.890
And we even see now President
Trump and Fed chair Powell

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:51.970
a little bit at odds about
where should interest rates go.

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:54.279
And the Federal Reserve
is moving interest rates

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.960
up in the US now.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.070
But there's always that sort of
dynamic, a little back pressure

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:01.600
in every country.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.760
We like to think we have
independent central banks.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.580
But in some countries,
it's a tug of war

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.100
and we're seeing that
play out a little now.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.200
So we have easy credit
for a long time,

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.660
partly supplied by
foreign governments.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.250
Even China, in a sense.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:21.530
I mean, people were willing
to buy the US paper.

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.740
But also financial derivatives.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.500
Credit default swaps in
particular led to a lot

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.370
more leverage and also
the interconnectedness.

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:35.500
The derivatives tied
everybody together a lot more.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.910
Part of the leverage
was also accepting model

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:43.185
based capital rules at banks.

01:10:43.185 --> 01:10:44.560
The other thing
is I think we had

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.990
a lot of poor risk management,
back to Kyle's point.

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:51.250
So poor risk management
incentive structures.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:55.840
The basic incentive structure
at banks have a lot of bonuses.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.250
And some of you worked at banks.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:02.830
But on some level, it's sort
of heads I win, tails you lose.

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:06.130
I mean, if you put a big
position on and it pays off,

01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:08.770
and you're a trader, and
you're managing the mortgage

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:11.530
desk at Lehman and it pays off,
you say, all right, where's

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:13.930
my $5 or $10 million bonus?

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:16.470
I'm saying if you're
running the department.

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:21.410
I mean, hopefully some
of you will do that.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:25.370
But if you're on the other
side, and the firm fails,

01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:28.720
they don't say, please give me
back that $5 or $10 million.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.320
So there's asymmetric
incentive structures.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.020
And those have been written
about widely, academically.

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.990
I mean, we do have a lot
of asymmetric incentive

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:39.580
structures in banking.

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:40.375
Brotish?

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:44.845
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:44.845 --> 01:11:47.470
GARY GENSLER: So Brotish asked,
what about the rating agencies?

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.480
So I was absolutely
say, their incentive

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.970
structures-- within those
two words, a lot's packed.

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:53.080
Thank you.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.600
Rating agencies got paid
for issuing ratings,

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.600
but they're not-- you
know, give some money back

01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.870
if you got it wrong.

01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:02.350
So it's perverse
incentive structures,

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:06.100
both in terms of
the bonus structure,

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:11.680
employment, payment structure,
rating agencies, fees.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.620
Inherently, finance has a
lot of conflicts of interest.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.920
We're not going to get rid of
that, conflicts of interest.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.170
There's always
somebody in finance

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:24.950
who wants to separate their
customer from their money.

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:26.280
It's the nature of things.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.740
But in a sense, Starbucks
wants to separate you

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.800
when they say, do you
want the large cup--

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.240
or the grande
instead of the large.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.910
So that's the
nature of commerce.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.670
And it's just that,
you want some market

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:42.150
base and regulatory
things to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:44.250
So multiple failures
started to happen.

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:48.440
In the US, Bear Stearns
started to fail in 2007.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.080
So well before the epicenter
of all of this, you had--

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.410
in the UK--

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:53.910
James?

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:56.390
What was the first one that
failed in your country?

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.890
What's that?

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.013
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:00.180
GARY GENSLER: So where did--

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:03.570
where did-- but
the timber was dry.

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:06.720
It was like the fire
was going to go,

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.860
but the system could maybe
withstand one failure, Northern

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.210
Rock or Bear Stearns.

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:17.370
But by the summer of '08, in
this country when the large

01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:21.780
financial mortgage companies,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:28.470
had to go into receivership
around Labor Day of 2008,

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.820
it was teetering.

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.890
And then, of course,
if anybody remembers,

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:36.990
by September 15th or
something, it was just--

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:38.640
the system would have collapsed.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.450
Without government intervention,
the system would have fully--

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:44.013
we were kind of--

01:13:44.013 --> 01:13:45.930
And we would have been
in one of those moments

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:49.830
from the 18th or 19th
century where we--

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:52.260
or even the 1930s,
where it's likely we

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.660
would have blown
out the 20% or 30%

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.150
unemployment in this country.

01:13:57.150 --> 01:14:00.210
And some of your countries,
that is the case.

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.760
You saw it happen.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.420
I don't know all the
countries represented here.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.360
So that's my little quick
read of the financial crisis.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.170
But this wasn't meant
to be a lecture on it,

01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:15.160
but I thought, well,
why not throw it in?

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:15.870
It's finance.

01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:16.980
Any questions on that?

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.480
Hugo?

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.040
STUDENT: Not exactly
on the crisis.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.450
But if you have to gauge
the state of the financial--

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.625
like of US finances right
now, what do you think?

01:14:25.625 --> 01:14:27.750
Are we in a better place
than we were 10 years ago?

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:29.480
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo is asking
if we're in a better place

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.750
than we were 10 years ago.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:33.120
Yes, in a number of ways.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.430
But as Sheila Bair's
writing said, in other ways,

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.320
it's not all that different.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:49.430
So I think that we have high
valuations in the stock market.

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:52.040
But it's not a
levered asset class.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.780
So real estate bubbles
usually are very--

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.990
higher probability that
a real estate bubble

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.390
will lead to
calamitous outcomes,

01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:04.720
because there's a lot of
borrowing against the asset

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.540
bubble.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.950
So when we had no
aid, and you had--

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:12.620
in Iceland, when
the banks failed.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.430
In many countries, when
you see huge failures,

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:19.240
it's when you have a real estate
bubble with a lot of borrowings

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.290
against it.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:25.630
When the revaluation comes,
the debt on that asset class

01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:29.530
is higher than the valuation
on the asset class.

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:36.090
And that usually leads to
some either calamitous outcome

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:42.060
or government bailouts,
and it takes a while.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.130
Debt bubbles.

01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:46.180
A debt [INAUDIBLE]
bubble is much harder.

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.990
So back to today, I think
we have a bit of a bubble.

01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:51.780
We've had low interest
rates for a long time.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.120
We've had pretty
good economic growth,

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.530
even though it's not
fully and equally shared.

01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:59.175
But a lot of economic growth.

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:06.480
I think the banking
sector is stronger.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.820
It's more Capital.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.580
One of the results of the
reforms in Europe and the US,

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:12.890
there's a lot more
capital in the system,

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:14.570
meaning less leverage.

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:18.890
But on the other hand,
the banking sector

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:21.200
is a bit more concentrated.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:25.363
And concentration leads
to additional risk.

01:16:25.363 --> 01:16:26.780
The other thing,
and this is maybe

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:31.490
my feeling is, as we're not
sharing the economic well-being

01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:34.610
broadly in the economy,
that middle income

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:38.990
America, middle income
of Europe in particular

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:44.370
is not sharing as much, I think
that hurts us in two ways.

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:50.120
One is, if we have the
downturn, there's not as much--

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.790
all economies these days
are led by consumption.

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:57.320
There's not as much ability
to respond with consumption.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.955
And two, I think it also
tears at our social fabric.

01:17:00.955 --> 01:17:02.830
And now I'm talking more
about the political,

01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:05.690
but it's sort of-- there's
less of a social fabric

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:08.590
for consensus when things hit.

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.125
Sorry.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.490
STUDENT: Going and touching
on the consumption aspect,

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:16.300
I think Sheila mentioned
that consumer spending was

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.990
a part of the financial crisis.

01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:20.700
And she suggested that
instead of providing relief

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.095
to the banks, what the
government should have done

01:17:23.095 --> 01:17:26.420
is provide relief to
consumers instead.

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.500
I was wondering what
your take on that is.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.220
GARY GENSLER: So Sheila
Bair's point was, we

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.680
did a bunch of things
bailing out big institutions.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.280
We didn't help
home owners enough.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.690
I think factually she's correct.

01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:42.570
And then you have to say,
are the adjectives correct?

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:45.890
Like we did provide trillions
of dollars of support

01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:50.140
for big institutions
and not for individuals.

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.710
And there is where the debate
is and all the challenge is.

01:17:55.710 --> 01:17:56.720
I think it's correct--

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.980
Tim Geithner wrote a book.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.480
If you ever get a
chance to read it,

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.710
it's a very lively and
easy read about the crisis.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.740
And he said, sometimes,
it's like, you

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:08.780
know, bailing out the arsonist.

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.600
I think those were Tim's
exact words in his book,

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.950
but if I'm wrong, sorry
Tim for misquoting you.

01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:18.940
But it's a hard public
policy challenge

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:21.710
that Ben Bernanke
and Tim and others

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.340
were facing at that point.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.150
But I think Sheila
is right factually.

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:29.460
And then I leave for
you the policy debate.

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.650
Let me just mention.

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:31.910
The financial sector--

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:33.530
I'm closing on this--

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:35.150
legacy customer interface.

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:39.470
When you're thinking about
any blockchain solutions,

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.270
as Eric said, it's legacy.

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:42.020
Are they slow?

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.570
Are they moving slow?

01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:45.740
It's got to be data
intensive at some point.

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.870
I don't think blockchain
has a lot of use

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:49.520
if it's not data intensive.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.020
Are there economic rents?

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.640
If there aren't
economic rents, it's

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.973
probably less likely you're
going to be able to tuck in.

01:18:54.973 --> 01:18:57.210
But if there's big
economic rents,

01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:01.820
like 2.7% on payments and the
like, that might be a place

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.720
you can tuck in with a
new disruptor strategy.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.520
Sometimes there's
concentrated risk.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.590
We talked about that.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:11.030
Or the infrastructure costs.

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:13.910
I know there was earlier
talk about counterparty risk

01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:16.400
and so forth.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.740
The good news is there's
a wide acceptance

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.030
of adoption of new tech.

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:22.820
I'm not going to say it's going
to bail out a bad blockchain

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:25.760
idea, and I'm not looking
for a bunch of ideas

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.810
about scams and frauds.

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:30.050
But there are wide acceptance.

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:33.170
And there's 7.5%
of the US economy,

01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:36.680
and similar numbers-- probably
5% to 7% of most economies

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.110
are in finance.

01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:42.230
By the way, because the capital
markets and the equity markets

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:46.040
are about 500% of the economy--
it's about $100 trillion when

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.640
you add up all
those other slides--

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.680
finance earns 7.5%.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.490
So that's about 1.5% vig.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:59.030
That's an old term
from a gambling house.

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:00.290
What's the vig?

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.880
What's the take?

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:07.160
Finance takes about 7.5%
divided by over about 500%.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.870
Or it's about 1 and 1/2%.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:11.360
That's not true everywhere,
but asset management

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.340
might take 50 or
80 basis points.

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.440
Banking might take wider.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.380
But largely, that's
the opportunity

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.000
that I keep mentioning.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.590
Let me just mention
one more thing.

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:23.510
I'm going to skip through this.

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:25.130
Next week's readings.

01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:27.425
October 16th, you'll
have a surprise guest.

01:20:27.425 --> 01:20:29.300
You'll have some fun
with the surprise guest.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.233
I guarantee you.

01:20:30.233 --> 01:20:32.150
I guarantee if you just
want to have some fun,

01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:35.090
you'll remember next
Tuesday for a while.

01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:39.050
But I added an additional
reading that's from today.

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:43.250
Nouriel Roubini testified in
front of the Senate Banking

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.540
Committee today.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.940
I read it before
I came to class.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.760
I can't say it's required,
it's just additional.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.470
But it is lively.

01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:56.120
And he just does a slap down
on blockchain technology.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.100
But for those of
you who read it,

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.200
that will be part of our
discussion next Tuesday

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:00.530
as well.

01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:01.910
Because we're going to
talk about the economics

01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:02.930
of blockchain.

01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:05.600
I'm going to focus more on
Christian Catalini's paper.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.130
But Paul Krugman, his
is a two-page slap down.

01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:14.240
These are kind of the Bitcoin
and blockchain minimalists.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.630
And next Thursday is a little
bit towards the maximalists.

01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:19.730
But I want to talk about
the economics, what

01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:21.830
I'll call Act 2.

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:22.660
So I thank you.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.785
I'm supposed to let you go.

01:21:23.785 --> 01:21:25.010
I've gone two minutes over.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.610
So--

01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:29.560
[APPLAUSE]

[SQUEAKING]

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:12.400
JONATHAN GRUBER: So
today, we're going

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.390
to continue our discussion
of equity and efficiency.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.570
We started last time talking
about the equity-efficiency

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.560
trade-off.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.163
Well, first we
talked about why we

00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:23.830
think redistribution
might be necessary,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.500
and the striking facts
on inequality and poverty

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.030
in the US.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.575
Then we talked
about the trade-off,

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.450
the equity-efficiency
trade-off, and the fact

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.530
that when you try to deal with
a problem like redistribution

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.320
through taxation or
transfers, you're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.740
going to have a leaky bucket.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.500
That there's going to be
inefficiencies associated

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.860
with both taxing individuals
to raise the money,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.320
and transferring to
individuals to spend the money,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.430
are both going to
cause deadweight loss.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.220
So what I want to
to today is take

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.960
that abstract framework
from last time,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.670
put it in some real terms.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.880
By talking first about how
taxation works in the US,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.790
and the kind of issues we face
in taxing people, and then

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.910
turning to
redistribution programs.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.860
And concluding with
a very positive story

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.260
of what I call a patch
to the leaky bucket,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and how we can redistribute
in a very efficient way.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.715
So let's start by talking
about taxation in the US.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.750
And when I talk
about taxation, I

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.420
want to talk about
two topics primarily.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.940
The first topic is,
who bears taxes?

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.900
Who bears taxes?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.720
Now, this is a
topic that we call--

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.240
in public finance, the field
I specialize in-- the topic

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.850
of tax incidence.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.760
Now, you might think
this is a silly question.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.510
If you pay tax,
you bear the tax.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.010
Why is this an
interesting question?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.968
And the answer is, it's
an interesting question

00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:58.560
because it's not true that
the person that bears the tax

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.930
pays the tax.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.190
That in fact, when
you impose taxes,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.490
they have complicated effects
on multiple parties because

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.100
of the operation of the market.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.710
So as a result, the party
that actually sends the check

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.690
to the government may not
actually bear all that tax.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.030
And so that's the interesting
insight we'll start with today.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.380
So to think about that, let's go
to figure 22-1, and let's think

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.760
about the market for gasoline.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.650
You've got demand and supply.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.200
You've got an initial 100
billion gallons of gas being

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.830
sold at a price of $1.50.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.240
Those were the days,
back when gas was $1.50.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.240
Now, imagine the government
comes in and says,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.700
we're going to levy a $0.50
tax per gallon on the suppliers

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.310
of gasoline.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.160
So the gas stations, or the
gas companies, or whatever.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.847
For every gallon they sell,
they will send us $0.50.

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:53.680
You literally cut a
check to the government,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.040
$0.50 for every gallon you sell.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.350
What does that do--

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.630
and you might stop
there and say, OK, well,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.030
then the incidence
of that tax is--

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.798
that tax is borne by producers.

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:04.340
That's great.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.310
I don't have to worry about it.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.935
I'm buying gas.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.100
It's those guys selling
gas who have to bear it.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.027
But you'd be wrong.

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:10.610
And the reason you'd
be wrong is shown

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.860
in the right-hand-side
diagram, which

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.287
is to think through the market
effect of such intervention.

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:18.370
What does intervention do?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.550
Well, it has no effect
on the demand for gas.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.860
The fundamental demand curve.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.680
The underlying utility of
the marginal gallon of gas

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.000
hasn't changed.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.460
But it has changed
the supply curve,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.290
because essentially, we've
introduced a new marginal cost.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.252
The marginal cost of gas has
gone up by $0.50 a gallon.

00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:38.710
Every gallon of gas you produce
and sell now bears an extra

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.360
$0.50 cost.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.490
So that's a shift upward
of the supply curve.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.870
Remember, the supply curve
is the marginal cost curve.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.580
So if I increase the marginal
cost of every gallon by $0.50,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.700
that's literally just a parallel
shift upwards in the supply

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.750
curve.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.610
Supply curve shifts
from S1 to S2.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.160
That's the new supply curve.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.150
Well, at that new supply curve,
you cannot continue to charge

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.470
the old price.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.650
If you can charge the
old price of $1.50,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.070
people would still want to buy
100 billion gallons of gas,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.980
but companies would only want
to sell 80 billion gallons.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.850
Why?

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.107
Because the marginal
cost has gone up.

00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:18.899
And we have an
upward-sloping supply curve,

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.540
so at a higher
marginal cost, they're

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.420
going to want to
sell fewer gallons.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.790
So you have a disequilibrium.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.600
What happens is that the gas
company adjusts by sliding up

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.830
the supply curve to the
new equilibrium point D,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.890
where they sell 90 billion
gallons at a new price

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.677
of $1.80.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.760
This is all just standard
supply and demand stuff,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.560
we've seen that before.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.420
What's interesting
here is to note

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.560
that what this means
is that part of the tax

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.600
is borne by consumers.

00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:53.720
Part of the tax is
borne by consumers.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.840
What I mean by that?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.750
What I mean is consumers
used to pay $1.50 a gallon,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.880
and now they pay $1.80 a gallon.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.710
So the tax has increased what
they pay by $0.30 a gallon.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.960
Now, they're not sending
that check to the government,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.500
but it's the same thing.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.140
It's the same effect.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.200
The point is this tax has
increased the amount that

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.330
consumers pay for gas
by $0.30 a gallon.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.800
So the incidence on
consumers is $0.30.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.350
The incidents on producers
is a little more complicated.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.900
They now get $1.80 per gallon.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.220
That's great.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.730
But for every gallon they sell,
they have to send a $0.50 check

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.380
to the government.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.470
So their net price
per gallon is $1.30.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.580
So we can see that by taking
the new price at point D

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.230
and subtracting off the
$0.50 tax they have to pay,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.500
which says that instead
of $1.80, they get $1.30.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.020
We call that the tax wedge.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.890
The tax wedge is the difference
between the tax including

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.800
the price and the tax
after paying the price.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.650
So it's just a
wedge between what

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.067
people get before
they pay the tax

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:15.692
and what they get
after paying the tax.

00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:16.640
That's the tax wedge.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.430
We have a $0.50 tax wedge here.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.270
And so what is the burden
of the tax on producers?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.900
Well, they used to
get $1.50 a gallon.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.680
Now they get $1.80 but pay
$0.50 to the government.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:42.260
So the burden on the
producers is $0.20.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.368
So even though the producers
are sending the check

00:06:45.368 --> 00:06:46.910
to the government--
the gas stations,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.160
the gas companies sending
the check to the government,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.140
they actually pay less
than half the tax.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.200
Now, nominally,
they pay the $0.50,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.430
but we don't care about that.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.930
We just care about
where they end up

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.490
after the market is adjusted.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.150
After the market is adjusted,
they are $0.20 per gallon worse

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.802
off than they were before.

00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:06.260
And consumers are $0.30 per
gallon worse off than they were

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.790
before.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.340
This is the fundamental
insight of tax incidence,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.350
that you can't just
look at the paper

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.360
version of who pays the tax.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.130
You have to consider
who really bears

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.870
the consequences of the tax.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.080
And that's why it
gets interesting.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.880
Because the party that bears the
consequences is not necessarily

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.530
the party that actually sends
the check to the government.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.660
That's the fundamental
insight of tax incidence.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.280
Questions about
how that all works.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.877
OK.

00:07:36.877 --> 00:07:39.460
So bottom line is all you do is
you say, look, think about how

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.025
the tax affects the market.

00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:43.150
In this case, it's an upward
shift in supply curve.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.800
Shift the supply curve up.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.440
Find the new equilibrium.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.770
That gives you the
new equilibrium price.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.895
And then the burden on the
party not paying the tax

00:07:51.895 --> 00:07:54.312
is the difference between the
new price and the old price.

00:07:54.312 --> 00:07:56.980
The burden on the
party paying the tax

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.180
is the new price minus
the tax they have to pay.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.500
OK?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.890
Now, what's
interesting about this

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.270
is that within this framework--

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.322
so the first bold claim
I'm going to make is,

00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:13.280
actually, it doesn't
matter who sends the check

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.680
to the government.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.815
The first bold claim--

00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:17.150
let me tell you about it.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.170
The first bold claim
I'm going to make

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.378
is that the amount set on
the check to the government

00:08:20.378 --> 00:08:22.640
is not the amount you
actually bear of the tax.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.070
The amount you bear of the tax
comes out of this analysis.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.028
Here's the second bold
claim I'm going to make.

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:30.570
It doesn't matter who sends
the check to the government.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.640
If you impose the same $0.50 tax
on consumers of gas in the same

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.266
market, you get
the same outcome.

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:38.099
How's that possible?

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.990
Well, let's look at figure 22-2.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.620
Now we have a different tax.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.010
This tax is now every time
you buy a gallon of gas,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.780
you pay $0.50.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.370
Imagine the outcry.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.847
Imagine if the government had
a tax which made gas companies

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:58.430
pay $0.50 of a gallon they sold,
and they said, you know what,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.400
we're just going to switch that
and make people pay the $0.50.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.110
Could you imagine the headlines?

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.280
The outcry?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.600
Government screwing the little
guy to favor the oil companies.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.662
But in fact, those headlines
would all be wrong.

00:09:11.662 --> 00:09:13.120
Because in fact,
it doesn't matter.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.790
To see why, let's look
at the diagram 22-2.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.850
Now imagine we have a
$0.50 tax on consumers.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.370
Now the supply curve doesn't
shift because marginal cost

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.870
hasn't changed.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.050
But the demand
curve shifts down.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.240
Because for every
gallon you buy,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.027
you have to send $0.50
to the government.

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:32.110
Well, the demand curve
represents your willingness

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.080
to pay.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.600
You are now willing to
pay $0.50 less per gallon.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.980
If you're willing to
pay before at point A,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.530
the 100 billionth gallon sold,
they're willing to pay exactly

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.380
$1.50.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.760
Well, if they only pay
$1.50 and now you send $0.50

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.218
to the government, well, now
they're only willing to pay $1

00:09:49.218 --> 00:09:49.930
for that gas.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.660
So what that means
is consumers now,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.560
with the shifting demand curve,
if the price stayed at $1.50,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.050
they would only want 80
billion gallons at point C.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.840
They would only want 80 billion
gallons at a price of $1.50.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.470
Why?

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.530
Because the price to
them isn't $1.50 anymore.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.600
They pay the $1.50,
plus they pay the $0.20.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.150
They'd have to pay another
$0.50 check to the government.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.180
So they only want--

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.880
so to them, they don't
want 80 billion gallons.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.588
So you have to move
to a new equilibrium.

00:10:20.588 --> 00:10:22.422
Once again, we know
about these adjustments.

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:23.460
We talked about that.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.760
You're going to slide
down the supply curve,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.116
and you're going to end
up at a new point D.

00:10:30.116 --> 00:10:32.010
D is the new equilibrium
where the new demand

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.520
curve, reflecting the much
lower willingness to pay,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.940
intersects the supply curve.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.530
That point, interestingly,
is at 90 billion gallons.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.000
Flip the page back to 22-1.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.910
That's the same
quantity we had before.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.740
So we get the same effect
on the amount of gas sold.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.810
What's the difference
is the market price.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.510
In 22-1, the market
price rose to $1.80.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:01.890
Now, the market
price falls to $1.30.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.920
But the burdens are the same.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.940
Think about the burden
on the consumer.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.530
The consumer used to pay $1.50.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.530
Now they pay $1.30.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.400
So they saved $0.20.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.840
But they have to send a $0.50
check to the government.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.421
So the burden on the
consumer is $0.30.

00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:25.400
They save $0.20 on the
price and send a $0.50 check

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.350
to the government.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.360
What's the burden on producers?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.300
Well, the producers
used to get $1.50.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.430
Now they get $1.30.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.370
So what's the burden
on producers? $0.20.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.040
Same as before.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.230
The point is for
any given total tax

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.050
wedge, for any given
total amount of tax,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.670
who bears it does not
depend on who sends

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.250
the check into the government.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.540
That's irrelevant.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.732
The side of the
market's irrelevant.

00:11:53.732 --> 00:11:55.440
All that matters is
the underlying demand

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.765
and supply curves and the
size of the tax wedge.

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:01.140
As long as you
have an underlying

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.630
set of supply and demand curves
and a given size tax wedge,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.060
you don't care
who actually pays.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.430
Because the market will
adjust to offset that.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.500
And so this is an
incredible insight

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.990
of tax incidence, which
is that something--

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.140
I'd imagine most of you
walk in this room today,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.680
and I quickly said to you, does
it matter if the gas company

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.120
pays $0.50, you pay $0.50,
you'd say, yeah, it matters.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.410
But it turns out it doesn't.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.035
Turns out it doesn't.

00:12:27.035 --> 00:12:28.410
As long-- given
a given tax wedge

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.243
and given a set of
supply and demand curves,

00:12:30.243 --> 00:12:32.503
it doesn't matter
who actually pays.

00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.920
And that's the fundamental--
it's another fundamental side

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.090
of tax incidence.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.220
And that's why, when
you read articles

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.800
in the paper about this tax
is bad because it's on people,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.840
this tax is good because
it's on corporations, that's

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.090
not the way to think about it.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.010
The way to think about it is
what's the total tax wedge,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.600
and what does the
market look like?

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.221
Yeah?

00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:52.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.080
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Excellent point.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.247
All of this, of course, is
within our standard 14.01

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.440
framework.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.120
Once you depart from that--

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.180
by the way, it's also true even
if there's monopoly and stuff.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.510
That's still true.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.670
So this does not depend on
perfectly competitive markets.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.680
This is also true in
non-perfectly competitive

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.740
markets.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.210
So monopoly, oligopoly will
still feature these two rules.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.610
However, once you depart from
perfectly rational consumers,

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.568
then things can change.

00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:26.777
So for example, there's a
lot of interesting research

00:13:26.777 --> 00:13:28.140
on what's called tax salience.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.653
And as I said, since
I won't have time

00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:35.820
for a lecture on behavioral
economics this semester,

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.960
I'm going to throw some
behavioral economics

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.725
nuggets at you.

00:13:37.725 --> 00:13:39.600
But if you find this
interesting, take 14.13.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.662
It's really exciting.

00:13:40.662 --> 00:13:42.120
And here's a kind
of insight, which

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.750
is, what if people pay
attention to taxes when

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.390
it's in the price, but not when
it's rung up at the register?

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.270
So they ran a cool experiment
in supermarkets in California.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.390
They randomly, in some
cases, increased the price

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.705
on the shelf by the sales tax.

00:13:56.705 --> 00:13:58.620
In other case, they
kept the price fixed,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.660
and the sales taxes
rang up at the counter,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.010
like we normally do.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.990
And they found that
affected demand.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.990
That affected how much
people wanted the good,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.180
even though the net price
was the same, because it

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.670
was more salient when it
was built into the price

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.470
than when it's like at the
end, when you just ring it up,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.740
you don't pay attention to it.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.332
Yeah.

00:14:15.332 --> 00:14:19.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
research as to whether when

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.800
the consumer knows that
they're being taxed rather

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.620
than the producer, if that
changes how the demand function

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.750
works [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.833
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's exactly what I said.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.830
That's exactly what--
there's two questions.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:31.780
One is how this affects
the demand curve.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.822
That's what I was saying.

00:14:32.822 --> 00:14:35.672
That basically,
the demand curve--

00:14:35.672 --> 00:14:36.880
it's not quite your question.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.430
Your question's about
sort of a moral,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.847
like, do I feel differently
if one's being taxed another--

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:43.990
or you're talking about
the salience point?

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.950
AUDIENCE: Maybe like
a little bit of both,

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.710
just how people react
when they know for a fact

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.280
that they're paying the tax--

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.000
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.370
I think we don't know for
sure the moral aspect.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.220
But the salience aspect, we
do know for sure, which is,

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.260
how the tax is presented
affect people's demand,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.562
even though it shouldn't.

00:15:02.562 --> 00:15:04.020
Now, there's another
question which

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.603
I thought you were
going to ask, which

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:07.560
is, how does the fact
that you can see a tax

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.290
affect how people
feel about taxes?

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.820
So here's a super cool study my
colleague Amy Finkelstein did.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.210
You guys know E-ZPass, the
thing on the highway where you--

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.780
OK.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.360
So when states moved--

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280
when I was a kid,
you just wait in line

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.560
and pay cash to get
through the tolls.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.960
Now you just drive
through with your E-ZPass.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.823
So what's happened is it
made the tax less salient.

00:15:29.823 --> 00:15:31.490
It used to be you'd
feel pain every time

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.480
you go through the toll.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.430
Now it's just some bill you
get at the end of month.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.513
What she found is when
states switched to E-ZPass,

00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:38.660
they rapidly raised
their taxes on roads.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.190
They raised their tolls,
because people in mind as much,

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.800
so they could raise them more.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.770
So there's an interesting
politics aspect to this

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.950
as well.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.020
So this matters.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.850
Having said that, I'm
going to ignore it.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.433
But this stuff does
matter, and that's

00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:53.360
why behavioral economics
is fascinating.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.630
OK?

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.480
Now, there's a third point
I want to make about taxes.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.000
So I talked about
who bears taxes.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.160
I talked about the
side of the market.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.265
Side of the market
is irrelevant.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.630
And then the third point
I want to make about taxes

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.630
is it's all about
the elasticities.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.910
Which is, who bears a tax?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.290
For a given tax wedge,
who bears the tax

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.680
is all determined
by the elasticities

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.960
of supply and demand curve.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.490
And in particular, inelastic
parties get stuck with taxes,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.560
while elastic
parties avoid taxes.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.240
So inelastic agent, inelastic
firms, inelastic consumers,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.810
they get stuck with
taxes, while elastically

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.850
supplied firms, or
elastically demanded goods,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.360
they avoid taxes.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.750
So to see that, let's
look at figure 22-3.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.980
Let's go back to our tax on
the suppliers of gasoline.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.420
Once again, I hope
you know by now

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.253
it wouldn't matter if
demanders of gasoline.

00:16:57.253 --> 00:16:59.503
But it's a little easier to
see with suppliers of gas,

00:16:59.503 --> 00:17:01.840
so let's go back to our
tax suppliers of gasoline.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.810
So we have a supply curve
that's been shifted up by $0.50.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.480
Let's consider two markets,
one with perfectly inelastic

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.349
demand, one with
perfectly elastic demand.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.930
In the market, it was
perfectly inelastic demand.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.530
We used to sell 100 billion
gallons at a price of $1.50.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.050
Now we levy a $0.50
tax on suppliers.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.069
Where do we end up?

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.380
We end up still selling
100 billion gallons of gas.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.062
You have to, because inelastic.

00:17:25.062 --> 00:17:26.520
Well, if you're
going to still sell

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.080
100 billion gallons of
gas, then the suppliers

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.940
can't bear any of the tax.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.460
They have to be able to fully
pass the tax onto price.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.950
That is, they have to
be able to charge $2.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.540
Think of the logic.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.880
Suppliers have to be
on their supply curve.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.810
The supply curve has
just shifted up by $0.50.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.270
Therefore, if you're going
to sell the same quantity,

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.080
the price must go up by $0.50.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.075
So in that case,
who bears the tax?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.130
Who bears this tax on gas?

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.910
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.410
Yeah.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.310
AUDIENCE: Consumers.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.590
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Consumers bear all of it.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.296
Consumers bear all the
tax, suppliers bear none.

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:06.450
The supplier, you sent--

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.367
you just sent a $0.50
check to the government,

00:18:08.367 --> 00:18:12.580
but you're getting $0.50 higher
price, so you don't care.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.050
Insert 50 Cent joke here.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:14.780
In the gas?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.800
I don't know you
do a 50 Cent joke.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.340
Whatever.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:16.840
OK.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.080
So you don't care.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.880
Now let's flip the case.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:29.560
Let's imagine demand for
gas is perfectly elastic.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:35.020
Now, the supply curve
has shifted up by $0.50.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.300
Supply curve was
shifted up by $0.50.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.330
Now what happens is
consumers say, look,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.340
I don't care how you
feel, Mr. Supplier,

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.930
I'm not paying more
than $1.50 for gas.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.060
I have perfectly elastic demand.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.560
Supplier has no choice, then,
but to eat the whole tax.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.590
Because if they try to pass
any of it onto the consumer,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.880
the consumer will bolt. So
the new equilibrium is that--

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.440
where the price stays
the same of $1.50,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.390
and the quantity falls.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.290
In this case, the producer
bears the whole tax.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.790
The consumer pays no
more than it did before.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.990
The gas company gets the
same price it did before,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.360
but has to send a $0.50
check to the government.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.260
So the entire burden is
borne by the producer.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.260
What is going on?

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.540
Why would inelastic demand--

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.930
what's the intuition here?

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.410
So with inelastic
demand, consumers end up

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.787
getting stuck with the tax.

00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:31.620
And with elastic demand,
consumers avoid it.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.293
Yeah.

00:19:32.293 --> 00:19:33.960
AUDIENCE: With elastic
demand, consumers

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.220
are willing to pay any price,
so if the producers want

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.640
to put all of the tax on
them, they can, and consumers

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.920
can't do anything about it.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.620
But if you [INAUDIBLE]
elastic demand,

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.770
then they can go anywhere
else to get gas at $1.50.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.743
So if you raise your
price, then they're

00:19:49.743 --> 00:19:50.785
just not going to buy it.

00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:51.743
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:19:51.743 --> 00:19:52.410
Exactly.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.845
I like to think of this--
that's a very good explanation.

00:19:53.845 --> 00:19:56.420
I like to think in terms of
almost like negotiating power.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.540
It's not the right
way to think about it,

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.830
but I think it's
useful intuition.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.413
That when you've got
inelastic demand,

00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:02.610
you've got no negotiating power.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.650
You just want insulin.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.740
You're going to pay
anything for insulin.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.210
So the supplier
knows that, so it's

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.900
going to make you
pay the whole tax.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.140
It doesn't matter if you send
the check to the government

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.200
or he sends the check
to the government,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.035
he's going to pass
the whole cost to you.

00:20:13.035 --> 00:20:14.410
But if you think
about fast food,

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.035
if you think about
a tax on hamburgers,

00:20:16.035 --> 00:20:18.285
if you're going to charge a
penny more for hamburgers,

00:20:18.285 --> 00:20:20.620
I'm going to buy a hot
dog or a slice of pizza.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.540
Then the supplier
knows they're screwed.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.587
They have no leverage.

00:20:23.587 --> 00:20:24.670
You have all the leverage.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.045
You've all the
negotiating power.

00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:28.410
So they can't raise
the price on you.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.900
So the bottom line
is, inelastic factors

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:36.200
get stuck with taxes and
elastic factors avoid taxes.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.280
And that's sort of the
other lesson we get here

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.335
as we think about taxation.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.350
So at the end of the
day, all that matters--

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.035
if you think about any tax
being imposed in the US,

00:20:48.035 --> 00:20:49.910
it's never as simple as
just a gas tax, often

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.365
a complicated
giant set of taxes.

00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:52.370
You think about simple--

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.983
a single tax, all
you need to know

00:20:53.983 --> 00:20:56.150
is the elasticities, supply
and demand, and the size

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.317
of the tax, and you're done.

00:20:57.317 --> 00:20:59.268
You can figure out
who bears the tax.

00:20:59.268 --> 00:21:01.310
And the Congressional
Budget Office, for example,

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.190
does these exercises
all the time,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.910
and has estimates
of how given tax

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:10.100
changes will affect the income
distribution as a result.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.060
Now-- and actually, there's
a pretty cool study of this.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.710
Let me ask the question.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.020
We have hospital taxes.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.890
We have-- hospital.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.030
We have hotel taxes.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.370
I've got too much health
care on the brain.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.378
We've got hotel taxes
in many major cities.

00:21:27.378 --> 00:21:28.920
There's some instance
of a hotel tax.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.710
You can imagine a diagram,
we've got supply demand.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.050
How does the incidence
of the hotel tax

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.105
change when Airbnb comes in?

00:21:38.105 --> 00:21:39.091
Yeah.

00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:44.490
AUDIENCE: The consumer is
suddenly much more able

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.135
to switch around, and so
a lot more of the tax,

00:21:47.135 --> 00:21:49.268
or maybe all of it,
is borne by the hotel.

00:21:49.268 --> 00:21:50.310
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.570
What you see-- and how
would you test that?

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:54.570
How would you test that?

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.082
Yeah.

00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:58.540
AUDIENCE: Comparing prices in
areas with different taxation

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:58.980
rates?

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.022
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:22:00.022 --> 00:22:04.350
What you find is
when Airbnb comes in,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.710
hotel taxes are passed
less onto price.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.658
Hotel owners are more
bearing the taxes

00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:12.075
compared to consumers, because
consumers are more elastic.

00:22:12.075 --> 00:22:14.810
So that's an example
of how this can matter.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.550
OK.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.410
So now, let me say one
other thing about taxes.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:27.205
The last thing I want to say
about taxes is what to tax.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.010
And this is a fundamental
debate that goes back

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.340
to the 17th century,
which is essentially,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.910
should we tax people based
on what they produce?

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.610
That is, their income.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.160
Or should we tax people
based on what they consume?

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.410
Their consumption.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.517
The philosopher Thomas
Hobbs in, like, 17-whatever,

00:22:51.517 --> 00:22:53.100
talked about, why
should we tax people

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.840
based on the fruits
of their labor?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.132
Let's tax them based on what
they take out of society--

00:22:57.132 --> 00:22:58.700
that is, what they consume.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.890
And this is a debate economists
have had for centuries.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.857
Should we tax
consumption or income?

00:23:04.857 --> 00:23:07.440
This debate, which shows in the
real world, because in Europe,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.140
they rely much more on
consumption taxes than we do.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.640
Yeah.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.990
AUDIENCE: Wait, would it matter?

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.240
JONATHAN GRUBER: I'm going
to tell you why it matters.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.610
So in Europe, they rely much
more on consumption taxes

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.312
than we do.

00:23:18.312 --> 00:23:20.520
So in the US, most of our
taxes come from income tax,

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.440
and in Europe, a lot
of their tax revenue

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.060
comes from what's called
the value added tax.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.110
And if you've
traveled in Europe,

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.485
you'll know about
the value added

00:23:26.485 --> 00:23:28.550
tax, which is a form of
consumption taxation.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.050
So this is a debate that plays
at international-- in the US,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.880
we have sales taxes,
but they're quite

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.902
small as a share of revenues
compared to European nations.

00:23:36.902 --> 00:23:40.400
Now, why do we care?

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.120
Well, we care because
the following equation.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.170
y, your income, can either
be spent on stuff or saved.

00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:51.530
Your income can either be
spent on stuff or saved.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.960
And as I talked about
a few lectures ago,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:03.360
savings is a major engine
of growth in the economy.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.880
More savings means a
broader pool of capital.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.493
Means a broader pool
of capital, which

00:24:17.493 --> 00:24:19.160
means a lower interest
rate, which means

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.960
firms can invest more.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.885
So we like promoting
savings in the long run.

00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:24.260
In the short run,
in a recession,

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:24.890
we may feel differently.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.110
But in the long run, we
like having more savings.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.750
So in the long run, we
like having more savings.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:35.070
If you tax income, you tax both
my consumption and my savings.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.520
If you tax my consumption,
then you don't tax my savings.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.090
That is, you relatively favor
savings over consumption.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:47.650
You promote people to save
rather than consuming.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.760
So that's why many economists--

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.835
I think probably if you
did a poll of economists

00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:53.920
and said, should be tax
income or consumption,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.080
the majority would
say consumption.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.970
And the reason
they would give is

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:00.223
because we need more
savings in society,

00:25:00.223 --> 00:25:01.390
and we need to promote that.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.042
Yeah.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:05.205
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it be
equivalent to taxing income

00:25:05.205 --> 00:25:06.970
and they're giving a
tax break for saving?

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: That would
be identically equivalent.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.080
If you give a 100% tax credit
for all of your savings,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.080
that would be identical.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.913
Now, in the US, we have
some partial credits

00:25:15.913 --> 00:25:18.540
like that, but far from 100%.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.260
So the question is, what's
the counterargument?

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.735
Well, the counterargument
is all about fairness.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.160
Which is that it turns out that
the rich save and nobody else

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.910
does.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.100
Basically almost all
the savings in society

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.620
is done by the top probably
10% of individuals in society.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.110
And the bottom 50% of
individuals in society

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.700
have basically no savings.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.910
So essentially, what this
means is for most Americans,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.250
for the typical
American, this debate

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.400
is irrelevant, because
they have no savings.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.400
You tax their income, you
tax their consumption,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.940
it's the same thing.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.400
For rich Americans, it'd
be a much better deal

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.160
to tax consumption,
because they have savings

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.520
that then wouldn't be taxed.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.500
So the problem with the
consumption tax base,

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.640
it'll mean a massive
redistribution from the poor

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.320
to the rich, because the
rich folks do the savings.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.390
Now, there would
be a simple answer

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.478
to-- there would be
an answer to this.

00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:26.020
We could answer this, because
ultimately, the rich folks die.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.550
It doesn't matter how rich
they are, they die eventually.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.000
And if at that point, we
taxed all their savings,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.380
we could then equalize things.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.590
So in other words, if we took
all the money that was left--

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.883
let's say we had
this consumption tax,

00:26:39.883 --> 00:26:41.550
but we counted its
consumption the money

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.685
you left behind when you died.

00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:46.060
Then it would solve the problem,
because the rich would--

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.540
during their life,
they'd pay less tax,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.915
but they'd pay it
all at the end.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.080
So that's why we have
a critical debate

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.970
in this country
over the estate tax,

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:58.150
or the so-called death tax.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.830
This notion of
whether you should

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.660
be taxed on their
estates becomes

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.430
very important for
thinking about this.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.850
If we had an estate
tax which was literally

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.690
at the same rate
as all other taxes,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.850
then we could move to
taxing consumption.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:10.990
It would be the same.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.850
In fact, we'd essentially have
a consumption tax at that point.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.950
But in fact, we
have an estate tax

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.770
that is paid only by
the top 0.04% of people

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.000
who die each year.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.693
And it's paid on only a
fraction of their assets.

00:27:26.693 --> 00:27:27.610
So we don't have that.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.700
So that's why the
fairness debate comes in.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.610
So I just want to point
out, just another--

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.520
these are all just topics I'm
hitting to whet your appetite.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.020
These are interesting
things we need

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.353
to think about when we think
about how to set up our tax

00:27:39.353 --> 00:27:42.360
systems, is basically
things like,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.410
do we tax income or consumption?

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.230
OK?

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.700
Questions about that?

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.450
OK.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.830
That's taxes.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.480
Now I want to turn to--

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.860
so that's one side of the
equation, which is taxes.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.560
We know they cause
inefficiencies.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.102
We know they cause
deadweight losses.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.003
And we know that there's some
question about who bears them.

00:28:02.003 --> 00:28:03.670
But the bottom line
is taxes are putting

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.350
some leak in the bucket,
and that's a problem.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.160
The other side of the leak
in the bucket is transfers.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.860
Which is, as we saw in
the diagram last time,

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.460
if you essentially condition
my getting money on my working,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.660
I'll work less.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.590
If you say to me,
hey, John, you're

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.230
currently making $5,000 a year.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.660
I'm going to give you $10,000
no matter what you do,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.160
but any money you
earn will come off

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.260
that $10,000, I'll say
great, I'll just quit.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.790
So the problem with transfers
is they act like taxes.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.290
If you take the transfers and
phase them out, take them away

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.957
from people, they
have a similar effect.

00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:46.890
In fact, we call
transfers an implicit tax.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.360
[INAUDIBLE] transfer
system from last time,

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.780
which is the amount you got was
the max of 0, was the max of 0,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.080
or 10,000 minus your income.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.200
This is essentially 100% tax
rate on everybody's incomes

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.533
below $10,000.

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:04.950
Because for every
dollar you earn,

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.740
we take it away, because you
get $10,000 no matter what.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.430
So this is a tax, basically.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.280
But in fact, this
tax is unavoidable

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.080
if we want to target
money to poor people.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:23.080
If we just gave everyone
$10,000, it wouldn't be a tax.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.410
We just gave everyone $10,000.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.190
Now, it would impact
how hard people work.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.590
Why?

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.090
Why would it impact
how people work?

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.270
Yeah.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.366
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
logarithmic [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:34.948
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, no, I'm
going to labor supply theory.

00:29:34.948 --> 00:29:36.490
What's the name of
the effect for why

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.210
that would affect [INAUDIBLE]
if we gave everyone $10,000?

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.650
The income effect.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.570
So it wouldn't affect
how our people work.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.730
But it wouldn't really
distort people's labors.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.980
We think of distortions that
arise in the substitution

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.480
effect.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.405
People making different
decisions because of tax rates.

00:29:50.405 --> 00:29:52.780
The reason we get a problem,
the reason we get deadweight

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.658
loss is because I'm ta--

00:29:54.658 --> 00:29:56.200
not that I'm giving
you $10,000, it's

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.580
that I'm taking away
as you get richer.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.970
That's the problem.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:04.133
So then the question is,
what can we do about this?

00:30:04.133 --> 00:30:06.300
What can we do about the
fact that we're essentially

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.480
imposing implicit taxes on poor
people by giving them money?

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.120
So there are a couple answers.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.450
The first is
categorical transfers.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.800
That is, instead of giving
the money to everybody,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.420
just give it to
deserving populations.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.370
So for example, one of them--

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.960
the largest single cash transfer
program, pure cash transfer

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.330
program in the US, is to--

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.090
that's literally giving cash is
what's called the SSI program,

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.610
the Supplemental
Security Income program.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.900
It's about $80 billion a year.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.410
And what this does
is give cash grants

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.960
to low income families that
have disabled children.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.390
So it's not just that
you're low income,

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.570
but that you have a disabled
child in your house.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.120
Likewise, we have
something called

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.260
the TANF program, which is
what is traditionally called--

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.110
I've used the term "welfare" in
this course to mean well-being.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.040
Traditionally in America,
when you say welfare

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.720
with a sneer on your face,
you're referring to TANF.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.530
TANF is cash grants to
low-income single-parent

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:21.743
households.

00:31:21.743 --> 00:31:24.160
Essentially, if you're low
income and you're a single mom,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.090
typically, you get a
grant from the government.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.330
Now, the question
people have always asked

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.740
is, why do we impose
these conditions?

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.560
Why do we make people disabled?

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.210
Why do we make them
be single moms?

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.130
Why don't just give
them the money?

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:39.940
Why not have this?

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.400
Why have these other conditions?

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.080
And the answer is because--

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.170
that basically, we
think this is a way

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:53.350
of reducing the distortion
that arises from transfers.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.620
Think of it this way.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.830
Imagine all of us
were born with,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.190
on our forehead, an
unremovable tattoo that

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.870
said "hardworking and lazy."

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.800
No, let's not do that.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.467
Different thing.

00:32:05.467 --> 00:32:09.760
Let's do "low skill
and high skill."

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.793
So I know your
underlying ability.

00:32:11.793 --> 00:32:13.960
Then I would simply say,
look, if you're high skill,

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.280
you don't get any money.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.030
I don't care if you're poor.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.780
If you're poor, it
just means you're lazy,

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.708
because I know
you're high skill.

00:32:19.708 --> 00:32:21.750
If you're low skill, I'm
going to give you money.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.270
And that would not
distort behavior at all,

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.870
because people couldn't
change what's on their head,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.287
so they would just continue
to work as hard as they always

00:32:29.287 --> 00:32:30.360
worked.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.820
This is the idea of trying
to find signals like that.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.680
You're trying to find
ways of identifying

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.210
the people who need the help.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.220
And by doing so--
who need the help,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.990
but need the help
in a way that's

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.570
not changed by their behavior.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.340
We think that a
kid being disabled,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.870
they didn't choose
to be disabled.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.580
Or mom being single
mom, she didn't

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.720
choose to be a single mom.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.660
That starts to get a
little more interesting.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.090
So essentially, the idea
of categorical welfare

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:01.470
is to basically say, can
we find things about people

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:05.040
that they didn't choose on which
we can base giving them money?

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.210
So blindness is a good
example, et cetera.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.670
Now, the question that then
raises, well, can people

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.810
choose these things?

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.513
Well, you might say,
well, of course,

00:33:18.513 --> 00:33:19.930
a kid can't choose
to be disabled,

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.680
but people can choose
to be single moms.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.690
In fact, the evidence
is the opposite.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.780
Let me explain what I mean.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.250
If you give people money
tied to being a single mom,

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.170
it doesn't cause them
to be a single mom.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.130
The evidence is
very clear on that.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.970
So there have been
hundreds of studies showing

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.250
that paying women money
conditional on being

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.542
a single mom doesn't cause
them to get divorced or have

00:33:43.542 --> 00:33:44.460
kids out of wedlock.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.820
That's been clear.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.590
But if you give family money
based on kids being disabled,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.440
more disabled kids show up.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.120
Why?

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.460
Because disability is a
tough thing to assess.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.112
Most disabilities are
musculoskeletal or mental,

00:33:58.112 --> 00:33:59.570
and those are hard
things-- you can

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.640
tell if a kid's missing
a limb, but it's

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.220
hard to evaluate truly
musculoskeletal or mental

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.840
disabilities.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.253
And interestingly,
despite your intuition

00:34:08.253 --> 00:34:09.920
what it might've been
a few minutes ago,

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.000
the place where in subsets we
see the most people changing

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.409
their behavior to qualify--

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.840
at least changing behavior
meaning not becoming disabled,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.150
but claiming they're disabled--

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.429
is here and not in
single motherhood.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.040
So categorical
transfers help, but not

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.170
as much as you might think,
because the categories

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.420
are hard to measure.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.150
And that's why
another tool we've

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:38.280
used to try to get at
this is in-kind transfers.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.199
In-kind transfers.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.679
OK.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.900
Part of the problem--

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.203
yeah, Manny.

00:34:52.203 --> 00:34:54.750
AUDIENCE: For the
TANF, does it account--

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.583
when it says for
single parents, does it

00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:59.500
account for people that
live in the household?

00:34:59.500 --> 00:34:59.960
So like--

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.585
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's
a great question.

00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:05.410
That's a tricky thing
to have to deal with,

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.640
which is how do you deal
with co-residing people?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.981
And that's something they have a
complicated set of rules about.

00:35:10.981 --> 00:35:14.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
stuff you didn't choose thing,

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:20.820
because they seem to try to
simplify the cons [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.956
choose, whereas I
think in real life,

00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:26.170
it's probably related to the
circumstances of your birth--

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.337
JONATHAN GRUBER: Absolutely.

00:35:27.337 --> 00:35:29.000
AUDIENCE: --and other
stuff like that.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.380
And so is it possible that these
indicators are making it worse

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.500
for people who are in situations
where they couldn't have

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.915
avoided being in
poverty, but they

00:35:37.915 --> 00:35:40.240
happen to not be a single
mom or not be disabled?

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.657
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Awesome question.

00:35:41.657 --> 00:35:43.715
And so basically,
here's the trade-off.

00:35:43.715 --> 00:35:45.340
Okay, give me a better
way to teach it.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.290
Here's the trade-off.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.617
The trade-off is,
the more you target--

00:35:49.617 --> 00:35:51.950
let's say I said I'm going
to replace our entire welfare

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.340
system in America with just
transfers to the blind.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.150
And let's assume people don't
blind themselves to get money.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.450
You laugh, but there
is a city in Florida

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.950
where they found that over
a certain period of time,

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.710
the vast majority of US
claim for lost limbs came

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.450
from one city in Florida.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.242
And it turned out that
people were actually

00:36:12.242 --> 00:36:14.575
cutting off their limbs to
qualify for government money.

00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:16.180
They actually
called it Nub City.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.130
So you laugh.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.300
This stuff does happen.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.310
But by and large, we
assume it doesn't.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.710
OK, so let's say I want to
replace the entire US welfare

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.070
system with one just for
people who are blind.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.810
On the one hand,
that'd be great,

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.670
because you wouldn't
cause any distortion.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.440
People shouldn't work any
less hard because you can't

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.550
change whether you're blind.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.690
On the other hand, you'd
leave all of these people

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.378
out in the cold who need help.

00:36:36.378 --> 00:36:38.920
So that's the trade-off, which
is the broader you spread it--

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.170
the more you move toward
a universal system,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.587
the more potential distortion
you cause in terms of people

00:36:43.587 --> 00:36:46.768
changing their work behavior,
but the broader set of people

00:36:46.768 --> 00:36:47.310
you can help.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.852
And that's why
there's a big move now

00:36:48.852 --> 00:36:52.120
for what's called universal
basic income, UBI.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.970
It's a big movement now
around the world to say, look,

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.770
forget these things, SSI, TANF.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.330
They're all messy to measure.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.370
They're stigmatizing.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.780
People can change them anyway.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.080
Let's just give people money.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.550
And that's sort of one
motivation for that.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.340
Now, but the other way to get
at this that people come at

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.860
is, look, the problem
all here is a simple one,

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.500
which is everyone loves money.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.810
Rich or poor, we all love money.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.510
But what if what we gave
people was not money,

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.630
but things that poor people
need and rich people don't?

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.870
Like for example,
mediocre public housing.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.270
Not a mansion, but an apartment.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.830
A rich person isn't
going to pretend

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.413
they're poor to get
a crappy apartment

00:37:33.413 --> 00:37:34.440
or a mediocre apartment.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.315
But a poor person who'd
be homeless otherwise

00:37:36.315 --> 00:37:38.640
will happily take it.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.710
What about medical care?

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.460
Rich people have private
health insurance.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.170
They don't need
government medical care.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.650
Poor people need
government medical care.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.080
What about food stamps?

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.380
Rich people can afford food.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.890
Poor people can't.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.970
So the idea is basically,
by giving in-kind transfers,

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:58.270
like medical care,
or housing, or food,

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:06.943
we get people to what we call
self-reveal that they're poor.

00:38:06.943 --> 00:38:08.610
Here the problem is
people might pretend

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:09.860
they're poor to get the money.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:10.918
They might quit.

00:38:10.918 --> 00:38:12.960
Even if they can afford
to work, they might quit.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.377
Here we say, well, look, you're
not going to quit your job

00:38:15.377 --> 00:38:17.380
to get a mediocre--
you guys with your--

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.363
make it 100 grand
a year at MIT, I'm

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:21.780
going to quit your jobs to get
some mediocre public sector

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.717
apartment.

00:38:23.717 --> 00:38:26.300
But if I said I'll give you 100
grand whether you work or not,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.370
you might quit your job.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.790
But say you live in a
mediocre apartment, you won't.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.790
So the idea, by giving
people in-kind benefits,

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:37.400
is to get them to self-reveal
whether they're actually poor

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.780
or not.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.412
Now, that's not the main reason
why giving in-kind transfers.

00:38:41.412 --> 00:38:42.620
This is the economist reason.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.230
The main reasons is
because politicians

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.000
are what we call paternalistic.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.093
And this comes all the way back.

00:38:51.093 --> 00:38:53.093
You guys remember when
we discussed food stamps,

00:38:53.093 --> 00:38:55.130
and we did budget
constraints, and I said, well,

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.240
we never want to give
people food stamps.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.520
We want to give them money.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.140
And they say, but what if the
[INAUDIBLE] labeled cocaine?

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.370
Then we would want to
give them food stamps,

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.745
because we don't want them to
spend the money on cocaine.

00:39:03.745 --> 00:39:06.390
Well, that's how politicians
feel about poor people.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.515
They feel that poor people,
if you give them money,

00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:09.380
will just waste it.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.550
And that's why the vast majority
of transfers we do in America

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.100
are in-kind.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.850
If you add up all the
money we give people

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.900
in cash versus the
money we give in-kind,

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.750
particularly medical care,
the in-kind dollars vastly

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.938
outweigh the cash dollars.

00:39:22.938 --> 00:39:24.980
And that's because
politicians are paternalistic.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.985
They're afraid-- no.

00:39:26.985 --> 00:39:28.610
The economics reason
is because there's

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.027
all this model of
self-revelation,

00:39:30.027 --> 00:39:31.970
but that's not why
politicians do it.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:32.750
They do it because
they're worried

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.800
people will waste the money
if you give them cash.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.720
And I think we
showed with the food

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.053
stamps and the evidence,
that's not really the right way

00:39:38.053 --> 00:39:38.882
to think about it.

00:39:38.882 --> 00:39:40.770
OK?

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.930
Questions about that.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:43.750
OK.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:48.360
Now, this is all kind of
negative and nebulous,

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.823
so let me conclude with
a great example, which

00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:56.112
is an example of a public policy
which actually doesn't stop

00:39:56.112 --> 00:39:57.570
the leak in the
bucket, it actually

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.400
puts a patch in the bucket.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.610
And that policy is called
the earned income tax credit.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:04.110
The EITC.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:11.935
This is what's known as
a conditional transfer.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.530
What that means is it's a
program where you get money,

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.890
but the money you get is
a function of how much you

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.740
make up to a point.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.522
So it's actually--
the other thing

00:40:30.522 --> 00:40:31.980
it's been called
is a wage subsidy.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.730
So here's how the EITC works.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.730
Let's go to figure 22-4.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.370
I'll show you how
the EITC works.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.100
Here's how the EITC works.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.830
For every dollar-- on the
x-axis is how much earned income

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:50.720
you have.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.100
On the y-axis is
the check you're

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.780
going to get from
the government.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.110
What this says is on
every dollar you earn,

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.460
until you earn $13,870--

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.960
these numbers are
a bit out of date.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.555
It's a little more now, but
roughly gives you the idea.

00:41:02.555 --> 00:41:06.010
Until you hit $13,870-- that
is roughly the poverty line.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.940
It's a little bit more
than the poverty line.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.490
For every dollar you earn,
the government gives you $0.40

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.210
more.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.210
So if you're someone who
starts with $0 and you earn $1,

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.770
you take home $1.40.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.630
It's a negative tax.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.460
It's a subsidy.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.320
So every dollar,
you take home $1.40.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.380
Until you reach
earnings of $13,870.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.310
At that point, you've
achieved a check of $5,548.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.403
That's 40% of 13,870.

00:41:30.403 --> 00:41:31.820
At that point, the
government says

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.190
this is the biggest
check we're sending you,

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.040
and we're to keep that flat
until you're at an 18,110.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.470
And then we'll start
to take it away.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.242
We're going to start to take
it away so that by the time--

00:41:44.242 --> 00:41:45.700
and what we're
going to do is we're

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.697
going to take that 5,548
check down by $0.21 cents

00:41:48.697 --> 00:41:49.780
for every dollar you earn.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.363
It's going to flip
from a negative tax

00:41:51.363 --> 00:41:54.790
to a positive tax at a 21% rate.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.100
So instead of a negative
tax at a 40% rate,

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.940
we switch to a positive tax at
a 21% rate, so that by the time

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:08.210
you've earned $44,454,
you've zeroed out your EITC.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.360
So for most of you, the
EITC will be relevant.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.460
For most of your families,
the EITC is irrelevant.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.950
So it's a targeted
transfer program.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:16.830
Conditional transfer.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.000
It's conditional
because basically, it's

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.560
conditional on working.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.050
But it's targeted in the
sense that it phases out

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.860
such that middle class and
upper class people don't get it.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:32.900
It's targeted to lower-income
people through this phase-out.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:38.690
The problem is this makes
the EITC effect complicated.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.940
So let's consider.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.580
Let's consider the three
segments of this graph.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.470
Let's start with
the first segment.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.190
Let's say you were
earning zero, and I said,

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:54.920
for every dollar you earn,
I will give you $0.40 more.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.340
What effect does that have on
your labor supply, starting

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:58.840
from zero?

00:43:01.804 --> 00:43:02.792
Yeah.

00:43:02.792 --> 00:43:09.573
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] more
because having a lot of leisure

00:43:09.573 --> 00:43:10.406
can cost a lot more.

00:43:10.406 --> 00:43:11.540
JONATHAN GRUBER: The
substitution effect

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.030
will make you work more, because
essentially, we've raised

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.670
the price of leisure by 40%.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.911
What about the income effect?

00:43:18.911 --> 00:43:20.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.520
JONATHAN GRUBER: There
is no income effect.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.978
So the point is,
for someone at $0,

00:43:23.978 --> 00:43:27.100
this unambiguously increased
their labor supply.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.700
So if you take guys who aren't
working, this definitely will--

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.900
I mean, it might
be a zero effect,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.790
but it's non-negative
effect on labor supply.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.147
Likewise, with low-income,
working low hours,

00:43:35.147 --> 00:43:36.480
the income effect will be small.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.070
Remember, the income effect's
proportional of how much you're

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:39.330
actually earning.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.580
So for these people on
the left-hand segment,

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.802
upward-sloping, it should
cause them to work more,

00:43:43.802 --> 00:43:45.510
because the substation
effect will be big

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.280
and the income
effect will be small.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.040
So if you mark the people
on this left-hand segment,

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.700
you should mark
they'll work more.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.450
Now what about people
in the flat segment?

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.190
Someone else raise
their hand and tell me.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.398
What's this going to do to
the labor supply of people

00:43:58.398 --> 00:44:00.632
on the flat segment?

00:44:00.632 --> 00:44:02.090
They're going to
work more or less?

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:02.683
Yeah.

00:44:02.683 --> 00:44:04.350
AUDIENCE: I think
they'll work the same,

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.290
because it's not like any
change in their earning.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
their wage hasn't changed,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.057
but something has changed.

00:44:11.057 --> 00:44:12.640
AUDIENCE: If they're
on the flat part,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.098
they'll work less
because they only

00:44:14.098 --> 00:44:17.126
have to work until they make
$13,870 to get [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:17.126 --> 00:44:19.770
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's not quite-- that's

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:20.580
an extreme model.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.130
More generally, it's
because of income effects.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.490
More generally, the point is
I've taken someone and made

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:28.770
them $5,000 richer.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.930
So compared to a world
without the EITC--

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.330
that's why I show-- compared
to a world without the EITC,

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.350
I will now work less.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.960
There's no substitution
effect, only an income effect.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.460
So now I'll work less.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.690
So the first part [INAUDIBLE]
substitution effects.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:42.820
The second part is
just an income effect.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.840
Now what about
the third segment?

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.230
We're assuming
leisure is normal.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.240
Do I work more or less?

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.670
Do I work more or less,
assuming leisure is normal?

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:57.230
Yeah.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.520
AUDIENCE: Less?

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.016
JONATHAN GRUBER: Less because?

00:44:59.016 --> 00:45:00.294
AUDIENCE: Substitution effect.

00:45:00.294 --> 00:45:03.420
JONATHAN GRUBER: Substitution
effect and income effect,

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:08.580
because your income
is falling as--

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.042
because the point
is, as you work more,

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:12.000
your income is falling.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.070
So here, both the
subsection and income effect

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.853
combine to make you
want to work less.

00:45:16.853 --> 00:45:18.270
So if you look at
this graph, this

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.800
doesn't look very promising.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.710
On the left, we've got a
bunch of guys working more.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.720
In the middle, we got
guys working less.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.340
And on the other
side, we got guys

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.230
working way less, because you
have a substitution and income

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.730
effect.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:36.820
So the question then is, what
effect does the EITC have?

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.570
And the answer is it turns out
it has an enormously positive

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.630
effect on labor supply.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:43.550
That it gets a lot of
guys who were working

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:46.283
zero to stop working zero.

00:45:46.283 --> 00:45:48.700
But it doesn't seem to lower
the hours among those who are

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.320
working more than zero hours.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.250
Now, why is that?

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.420
Unclear.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.020
It could be because there's
different elasticities

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.550
along the income distribution.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.175
Probably, it's because
of tax salience,

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:02.092
wherever I wrote that.

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.420
Wherever the hell I wrote that.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.360
Tax salience, which is that
people understand, gee, if I

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.630
go to work, I get a big check.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:09.047
They don't understand,
by the way,

00:46:09.047 --> 00:46:12.125
the marginal hour I work is
being taxed at $0.21 more.

00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:14.000
So probably, it's tax
salience, I don't know.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.300
But the bottom line is the
studies show convincingly

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.190
that interest in
the EITC massively

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:22.820
increased labor supply and
distribute to the poorest

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.600
people in society.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.810
This is a reverse leaky bucket.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:30.080
Literally, we managed to take
money, give it to poor people,

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.770
and make the pie bigger.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:36.660
So this is an enormous victory
for thinking about how we can--

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.620
for getting around
this problem of how

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.778
we can transfer to people.

00:46:39.778 --> 00:46:41.320
Now, it didn't solve
all our problems

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.360
because, [INAUDIBLE]
up here, it doesn't

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.770
help people who don't work.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.322
So there's still-- this isn't
the only solution we need,

00:46:47.322 --> 00:46:49.030
because some people
literally can't work,

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.230
so they can't benefit
from a program like this.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.773
But for workers, this is an
enormously successful program

00:46:54.773 --> 00:46:57.190
that is really one of the great
government success stories

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.020
in terms of both
transfer to poor people

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.910
and increasing the
size of the pie.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:01.500
All right?

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.410
I'm going to stop there,
and so we'll come back--

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.830
I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

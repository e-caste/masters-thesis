00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.620
We now study a model that
involves the sum of

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.140
independent random variables,
but with a twist.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.300
It's going to be the sum of a
random number of independent

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.470
random variables, as opposed
to a fixed number.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.440
This is a model that shows up in
a variety of applications,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.580
but it will also help us fine
tune our command of the law of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.280
iterated expectations, and the
law of total variance.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.980
The story goes as follows--

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.420
you go shopping and you visit
a number of stores, except

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.590
that the number of stores that
you will visit, is itself a

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.330
random variable.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.060
At each one of the stores,
you spend a

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.230
certain amount of money.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.180
We denote it by Xi.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.610
And we make the assumption that
the Xi's are drawn from a

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.650
certain distribution.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.280
They're identically
distributed.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.690
And they're independent
of each other.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.110
We also make the assumption that
the Xi's are independent

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.780
of capital N. This means that no
matter how many stores you

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.960
visit, the Xi, the amount of
money you spend in each one of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.789
the stores that you visit, is a
random variable that's drawn

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.930
from a common distribution,
which does not change, no

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.960
matter what capital N is.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.039
With these assumptions in place,
let us now focus on the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.260
total amount of money that
you're spending.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.450
This is the sum of random
variables, but with the extra

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.650
twist that the index goes up to
capital N, which is itself

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.020
a random variable.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.310
How do we deal with
this situation?

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.670
One approach that's always worth
trying when faced with a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.000
complicated problem is to
try to condition on some

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.840
information that will make
the problem easier.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.800
In this case, we can condition
on the value of capital N

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.650
taking a fixed specific value
because in that case, we will

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.630
be dealing with the sum of
a finite number of random

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.350
variables where that number is
a fixed, specific number.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.100
And this is a situation we have
encountered before and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.009
know how to deal with it.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.720
So let us get started.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.330
Let us calculate the expected
value of Y, if we condition on

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.670
the number of stores.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.850
Let's say, for example, someone
tells us that we

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.000
visited five stores.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260
Then, the expected value of Y
is going to be the expected

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.490
value of the sum of the amount
of money you spent in each one

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.230
of those five stores.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890
In our instance, it's that
random variable, capital N.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.690
But since I told you that
capital N takes a specific

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.930
numerical value, this means that
this instance of capital

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.000
N, in the index of the
summation, can be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.930
replaced by little n.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.620
If I tell you that capital N
is equal to little n, then

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.780
this number here, capital N,
becomes the same as little n.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.350
Here we use now the assumption
that capital N is independent

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.010
from the Xi's.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.580
Here we have the sum of a fixed

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.190
number of random variables.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.080
All of them are independent
of capital N.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.330
If I give you some information
on capital N, this does not

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.490
change the distribution of the
Xi's, so the conditioning does

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.760
not affect the answer.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.310
The conditional expectation is
going to be the same as the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.980
unconditional expectation.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.970
And now we have the expected
value of a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.910
sum of random variables.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.160
Each one of them has a common
expectation that's denoted

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.740
with this notation.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.130
This is the common expected
value of all the Xi's, and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.280
we're adding n of them, so
we obtain n times this

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.530
expectation.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.740
Now let us apply the total
expectation theorem.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.720
We take the familiar form of the
total expectation theorem,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.410
and in here, ' we can plug in
the expression that we have

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.960
just found, which is n times
expected value of X. Now the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.770
expected value of X
is just a number.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.520
And then we have this summation
here, which we

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.680
recognize to be just the
definition of the expected

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.800
value of N.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.190
And so we come to the conclusion
that the expected

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.590
amount of money that you will
be spending is equal to the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.340
following product--

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.550
the expected number of stores
that you visit times the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.790
expected amount of money
that you will be

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.760
spending in each store.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.690
This is a quite plausible
answer.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.440
It makes sense.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.730
On the average, the amount of
money you spend is equal to

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.010
the average number of stores
times the average amount of

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.190
money in each store.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.930
So it is intuitively what
you might expect.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.970
On the other hand, we know
that reasoning "on the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.360
average" does not always give
us the right answers.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.150
So it's important to corroborate
this particular

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.110
formula by working out a
mathematical derivation.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.100
Now let us carry out a second
mathematical derivation using

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.580
the law of iterated
expectations.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.690
To use the law of iterated
expectations, we need to put

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.040
our hands on this random
variable--

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.470
the abstract conditional
expectation.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.260
What is this object?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.680
It's a random variable that
takes this value whenever

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.300
capital N is equal
to little n.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.670
So it's an object that takes
this value whenever capital N

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.790
is equal to little n.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.409
But that object is the same as
this random variable because

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.530
this is the random variable that
takes the value here when

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.470
capital N is equal
to little n.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.280
Therefore, the abstract
conditional expectation takes

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.900
this particular form here, which
we can substitute inside

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.480
this expectation here.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.310
And now notice that the expected
value of X is a

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.190
constant, so it can be pulled
outside this expectation.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.710
And we're left with a product
of the expected value of N

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.160
times the expected value of
X. So this completes the

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.980
derivation of the expected value
of the sum of a random

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.810
number of random variables.

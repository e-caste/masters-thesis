00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.180
PROFESSOR: Hello
everyone, today we're

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.600
going to learn how a Solar
Cell is able to turn light

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.790
generated mobile charges
into electricity.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.420
Today's lesson
will use everything

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.460
we've learned in the past videos
to understand this effect.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.440
So, make sure you
understand the material

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.990
from the previous
videos before watching.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.510
First, let's go over the
structure of a Solar Cell.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.342
Here's a cell that I made.

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:40.300
And we can see that a
metal ribbon is connected

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.970
to the top metal contacts,
which form a grid.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.480
The spaces between
the grid lines

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.460
allow light to enter the cell.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.360
If we flip over the cell we
see the entire back surface

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.230
is coated with
metal, which allows

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.610
easy extraction of charge
from the back surface.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.590
Additionally, we have
another metal ribbon

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.276
that's connected
to the backside.

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:01.650
Now, let's hook
up our Solar Cell

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.860
to an ammeter to
measure the current.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.670
So, here we have an ammeter
connected to our Solar Cell

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.430
and our light source which
will simulate the sun.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.826
And we can see that if we
turn on our light source

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:15.200
we start to read a current
flowing out of our Solar Cell.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.070
In this case about 0.12
amps or 120 milliamps.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.980
Now, if we turn off the
light the output of the cell

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.670
drops to zero and we no
longer read any current.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.230
We know from our
last demo the light

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.500
generates mobile
charges and silicon.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.170
But how do these mobile charges
become a electric current

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.110
coming out of our Solar Cell?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.640
The secret has to
do with doping.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.660
The top layer is doped with
phosphorus, shown in blue.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.310
Well the bottom layer is
doped in boron, shown in red.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.380
The different dopants
interact in a way,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.870
which we'll describe shortly,
to create an electric field

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.630
in our device where
the Boron-doped and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.315
Phosphorous-doped regions meet.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.580
It is this electric field
that acts as a one way valve

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.940
in our Solar Cell for
electrons and holes.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.480
An electric field
is created when

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.240
positive and negative
charges are separated.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.919
As you know, opposite charges
attract and like charges repel.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.020
We'll exploit this
property by creating

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.920
a sheet of positive charges on
the left and negative charges

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.900
on the right, thus producing
an electric field, which

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.990
we denote with the
Greek letter z.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.460
If you were to insert a
negatively charged particle,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.710
such as an electron,
into this field

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.310
it would move toward
the positive charges.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.710
Alternatively, if you put a
positively charged particle

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.330
it would move toward
the negative charges.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.040
We're able to create an electric
field inside our Solar Cell

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.320
by using different dopants
on either side of the device.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.820
Here we have our silicon
lattice, which is un-doped.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.990
We'll start by replacing
some of the silicon atoms

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.180
with phosphorus
atoms on one side.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.200
On the opposite side
we'll put in boron atoms.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.070
To focus on our dopant
atoms and the mobile

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.800
charges they introduce we'll
fade out the silicon lattice.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800
Recall that phosphorus
atoms introduce

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.010
static positive charges in
mobile negative charges.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.620
While boron atoms introduce
static negative charges

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.040
in mobile positive charges.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.890
All the mobile charges are
free to move around at random.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.250
A process known as diffusion.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.610
Here we see a single
electron moving around

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.880
on its random walk.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.110
During this random motion if
an electron and hole encounter

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.380
each other they neutralize
and effectively vanish.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.490
As this process of
holes and electrons

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.035
randomly defusing
and neutralizing

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.750
as the interface
continues, the total number

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.490
of mobile charges in
the device decreases.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.240
This leaves a region
at the interface

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.620
of immobile static charges
where the net charge

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.170
is negative on one side
and positive on the other.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.050
These opposing sheets of
charge create an electric field

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.550
of the interface, which at
this point is very weak.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.870
As charges continue
to diffuse, they're

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.610
still able to move across
this weak electric field

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.110
and neutralize.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.380
As this happens, the
sheets of net positive

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.940
and net negative
static charges widen

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.370
and the electric field
grows in strength.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.470
Now that the electric
field is stronger,

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.860
as other mobile charges
continue to move and diffuse

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.750
around the lattice,
they're now repelled

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.630
by the field and electrons
to the left and holes stay

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.994
to the right.

00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:15.660
It is this electric
field that separates

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.320
light generated mobile
charges and pushes them

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.440
to the extreme
ends of the device.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.440
The image we see now is
our Solar Cell in the dark.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.310
However, recall that our
silicon atoms are still present.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.210
And if light strikes
our silicon atom,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.720
a mobile hole and
electron is generated.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.044
As these mobile charges
move around randomly

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.710
there's a chance that
they will randomly

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.420
encounter the electric field.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.780
The mobile electron will get
repelled by the electric field.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.384
However, the mobile hole will
get swept to the other side

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.300
by the electric field.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.320
Now, let's zoom out.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.560
We can see that after the
electric field has pushed

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.860
our light excited electron
and hole to the left

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.760
and right respectively, we now
have an extra negative charge

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.310
on the left and extra
positive charge on the right.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.470
If we connect a wire to
short the two opposite sides

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.750
together the excess
electrons are

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.790
attracted to the excess
holes on the opposite side.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.960
This attraction is what drives
electricity through our wire.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.470
As light continually
shines on the Solar Cell

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.120
charges are constantly being
pushed out of the device

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.510
and driving the
electric current.

00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:29.750
Now hopefully you
understand the basics

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.060
of how these amazing, but
rather simple, devices work.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.900
We hope that this knowledge will
provide the basic foundation

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900
while tackling more difficult
and abstract concepts while you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.610
learn the material
in this course.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.750
I'm Joe Sullivan,
thanks for watching.

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.180
MICHAEL SHORT: So today is going
to be the last day of neutron

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.630
physics.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.422
As promised, we're
going to talk about what

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:30.520
happens as a function of time
when you perturb the reactor,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.619
like you all did
about a month ago.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.410
Did any of you guys notice
the old-fashioned analog panel

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.710
meter that said, reactor period,
when you were doing your power

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.460
manipulations?

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.750
We're going to do that today.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.792
And you're going to explore
that on the homework.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.790
So I'm arranging for all of
your actual power manipulation

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.240
traces to be sent to you.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.005
So each one, you'll have
your own reactor data.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.880
You'll be able to describe
the reactor period

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.200
and see how well it fits our
infinite medium single group

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.330
equations, which it turns
out is not very well.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.670
But that's OK, because you'll
get to explain the differences.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.760
First, before we
get into transients

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.130
I wanted to talk a bit about
criticality and perturbing it.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.135
So let's say we had our old
single group kit criticality

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:13.635
relation.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.510
And I'd like to analyze,
just intuitively or mentally

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.100
with you guys, a few
different situations.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.910
Let's say we're talking
about a light water

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.180
reactor or a thermal reactor,
like the MIT reactor, or pretty

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.470
much all the reactors
we have in this country.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.830
What sort of things could
you do to perturb it?

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.430
And how would that
affect criticality?

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.800
For example, let's say you
shoved in a control rod.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.530
Let's take the
simplest scenario.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.670
Control rods in.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.600
What would happen
to each of the terms

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.950
in the criticality condition?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.860
And then, what would
happen to k effective?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.450
So let's just go one by one.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.479
Does nu ever change, ever?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.280
Actually, yeah, it does.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.638
Over time, you'll start--

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:16.180
that nu right there,
remember, that's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.120
a nu bar, number of neutrons
produced per fission.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.040
As you start to consume
U238 add neutrons.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.370
And as you guys saw through
a complicated chain of events

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.100
on the exam, eventually
make plutonium 239,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.370
which is a fissile fuel.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.380
The nu for 238 is actually
different than the nu for 239.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.137
So I don't want to say
that nu never changes.

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:47.470
It's just that shoving the
control rods into the reactor

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.300
is not going to change nu.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.050
But it does change slowly over
time as you build up plutonium.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.660
What about sigma fission?

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.330
If this were a blended
homogeneous reactor

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.340
or a reactor in a blender, what
would happen to sigma fission

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.010
as you then shove in
an absorbing material?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.210
Does it change?

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.140
AUDIENCE: No.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.370
MICHAEL SHORT: You say, no.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.580
And I'm going to add
here homogeneous.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.730
So in this case, remember if
we define the average sigma

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.920
fission as a sum--

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.210
I'll add bits to it--

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.230
of each material's volume
fraction, or let's say

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.490
atomic fraction, times each
material's sigma fission,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.010
if we throw nu materials
into the reactor,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.780
then this homogeneous
sigma fission

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.420
does change when
we put materials in

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.360
or take materials out.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.260
So you guys want to
revise your idea?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.750
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, thank you.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.000
There's only one other choice.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.770
Now the question
is, by how much?

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.370
If you put in a control rod
where let's say the control

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.200
rod's sigma fission
would be equal to zero,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.430
but volume would
be equal to small.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.373
Can't be any more
specific than that.

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:21.790
How much of an
effect do you think

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.960
you'll have on sigma fission?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.137
AUDIENCE: Small.

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:26.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Very small.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.560
So let's say a little
down arrow like that.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.320
What about sigma absorption?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.950
The volume is still small, but a
control rod by definition sigma

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.480
absorption equals huge.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.195
So what do you think?

00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:45.570
AUDIENCE: It's
going to increase.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.950
MICHAEL SHORT: It's going to
increase a little or a lot?

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.420
AUDIENCE: A lot.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Quite a bit.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.370
Now let's look at the
diffusion constant.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.200
And remember that the diffusion
constant is 1 over 3 sigma

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.990
total, minus the average
cosine scattering angle

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.230
sigma scattering.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.080
What do you think is going to
happen to the neutron diffusion

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.020
coefficient as you throw
in an absorbing material?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.580
Something that's got an enormous
absorption cross-section

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.240
is also going to have an
enormous total cross-section,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.160
because sigma total is
sigma absorption plus sigma

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.710
scattering.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.750
And sigma scattering
doesn't change that much.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.100
But if sigma absorption goes
up, sigma total goes up.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.160
If sigma total goes
up, then what happens

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.793
o the diffusion coefficient?

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:51.740
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.407
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
it's got a decrease.

00:05:57.675 --> 00:06:00.050
And how does inserting a
control rod change the geometry?

00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:04.520
AUDIENCE: It doesn't.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.728
MICHAEL SHORT: Very, very close.

00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:07.520
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.700
The control rod better
not change the geometry,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.890
but what I do want
to remind you of is

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.940
that this buckling term
includes-- let's say,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.420
this was a one
dimensional infinite slab

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.365
Cartesian reactor.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.425
That little hot over there
means we have some extrapolation

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:31.925
distance.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.040
Remember, if we were to
draw our infinite reactor

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.320
with the thickness
A and we wanted

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.180
to draw a flux profile
on top of that,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.090
it would have to be
symmetric about the middle.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:01.200
And let's say we had our axis
of this is x and this is flux.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.470
Flux can't go to zero right
at the edge of the reactor,

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.800
because that would mean that
no neutrons were literally

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.890
leaking out.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.370
So there's going to be
some small extrapolation

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.580
distance equal to
about two times

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.890
the diffusion coefficient.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.590
So the geometric
buckling is actually

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.820
pi over the reactor
geometry, plus 2 times

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.980
the diffusion coefficient.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.360
And if the diffusion
coefficient goes down,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.940
but it's also very,
very small compared

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.290
to the geometric buckling, how
much does the buckling change

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.740
and by how much?

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.685
And in what direction?

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:42.227
AUDIENCE: It increases
very slightly.

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:45.070
MICHAEL SHORT:
Increases very slightly.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.370
So the buckling might
increase very slightly.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.043
What's the overall net
effect on k effective?

00:07:52.043 --> 00:07:53.893
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

00:07:53.893 --> 00:07:55.810
MICHAEL SHORT: Should
go down, you would hope.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.640
If you put a control
rod in, it should

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.350
make k effective go
down, because there's

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.377
a little decrease here.

00:08:02.377 --> 00:08:03.710
Things kind of cancel out there.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.050
But the big one is putting
an absorption material,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.283
like a control rod in, should
make k effective go down.

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.700
And that's the
most intuitive one,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.520
but you can work out one
term at a time what's

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.560
generally going to happen.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.670
So let's now look at
some other scenarios

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.811
for the same
criticality condition.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.650
I'll just rewrite it so that
we can mess it all up again.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:46.900
Now we want to go for the case
of boil or void your coolant.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.450
And now we're getting into the
concept of different feedback

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.200
mechanisms.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.720
We've already talked
once about how

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.280
raising the temperature
of something

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.620
tends to increase
cross-sections in certain ways.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.120
But now let's say,
what would happen

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.680
if you boil your coolant?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.950
If things got really hot and
the water started to boil.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.515
What do you want to
happen to k effective?

00:09:12.515 --> 00:09:13.515
You want it to increase?

00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:14.190
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.648
MICHAEL SHORT:
Decrease, thank you.

00:09:15.648 --> 00:09:17.970
You want it to decrease, or
else you'd get a Chernobyl.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.750
And we'll talk about how that
happened in a week or two.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.240
So now let's reason
through each one of these.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.350
Let's assume that
nu doesn't change

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.120
when you boil the coolant.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.955
What about sigma fission
of the whole reactor?

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.190
You're taking a little bit of
material out of the reactor

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.440
by taking liquid water,
which is fairly dense,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.950
and making it gaseous
water, which is less dense.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.270
So overall, there are more
fissile atoms in the reactor

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.640
proportionately when the
coolant is boiled away

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.000
than when it's not.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.870
So what happens
to sigma fission?

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.290
The average sigma
fission for the reactor

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.020
will go up ever so slightly.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.820
Probably not enough to matter.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.010
What about sigma absorption?

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.210
If the coolant disappears.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.910
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
water is an absorber.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.130
Hydrogen and oxygen--
really just hydrogen--

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.940
have some pretty non-negligible
absorption coefficients.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.510
And if those go
away, then you're

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.917
losing a bit of
absorber, aren't you?

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:40.000
Actually it's interesting.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.620
Oxygen is the lowest thermal
cross-section of any element.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.010
So we can treat it as
pretty much transparent.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.770
Now how about the
diffusion coefficient?

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.380
We've got the formula
for it up there.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.170
If all of a sudden
your neutrons don't

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.590
have much to moderate from--

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.430
there's not much to
moderate your neutrons.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.660
Yeah.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.410
AUDIENCE: Your scattering
just disappears.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.560
MICHAEL SHORT: Your scattering
just disappears, right?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.140
But so does some of your
total cross-section.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.790
So chances are,
those neutrons are

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.000
going to go farther before
they undergo any given

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.720
collision because there's
no water in the way.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.470
So you'd expect neutron
diffusion to go up.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.940
And what about
geometric buckling?

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.350
Diffusion goes up, then
the geometric buckling--

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.830
I'm just going to
make it really small.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.960
But the net effect here, once
again, k effective goes down.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.240
We didn't talk about anything to
do with the actual temperature

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.490
effects on the cross-sections.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.950
This is just a density
thing on the coolant itself.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.100
So let's now look at that.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.560
What about if you
have some power spike,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.840
raised fuel temperature?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.330
I'll write it again, so
we can mess it up again.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.930
So let's say you raise
the fuel temperature.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.330
And that's going to cause
every cross-section effectively

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.840
to increase if you're doing
this average scenario.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.280
Let's talk a little
bit about why.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.960
It's not as simple
as just saying,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.030
the cross-sections go up.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.580
So let's say we had two
different temperatures,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.980
cold and hot.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.430
So this would be your
sigma fission cold.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.150
And this would be your
sigma fission hot.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.250
For cold, sigma fission
looks something like that.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.380
And as the temperature
goes up, these

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.110
resonances, which I'll
just label right here--

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.690
resonances being
specific energy is

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.120
where the absorption suddenly
goes up, suddenly goes

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.170
down will actually
decrease in height.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.950
But they'll start
to spread out more.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.310
That's about as well as I
can draw it very crudely.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.870
And same thing goes not
just for sigma fission,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.920
but for sigma anything,
including absorption, including

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.790
total whatever you want.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.510
And so if your goal is
to get your neutrons

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.910
from the fast
region where they're

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.890
born into the thermal region
where you get fission,

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.160
broadening these cross-sections
makes it more likely

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.890
that if the neutron loses
any amount of energy,

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.160
it's going to hit one of
these big resonance regions

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.330
and get absorbed or taken
away before it gets a chance

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.920
to go to the fission region.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.420
So what this is
really going to do--

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.800
it's kind of funny to say
it in terms of a one group

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.610
criticality relation, but
your fission cross-section

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.250
is actually going to go down.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.580
One reason is that the fuel
physically spreads out.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.520
And so just from the
density modification,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.550
you're not going to get as much.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.230
But then you've
also got that effect

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:14.690
of increasing fission from these
resonance regions spreading

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.440
out.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.990
The question is, which
one is a bigger effect?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.930
Can't answer that with
a simple statement.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.920
You'll go over a lot
more of that in 22.05

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.610
when you talk about what
actually defines a resonance

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.290
region, how do you
calculate them,

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.680
and how do they Doppler broaden
or broaden with temperature.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.390
How about sigma absorption?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.278
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

00:14:36.278 --> 00:14:38.070
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
sigma absorption, it's

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.770
going to go down because
things spread out.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.930
But it might also go up because
the cross-sections spread out,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.405
or the resonances spread out.

00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:49.530
What's really going to
happen though is the reactor

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.200
atoms are effectively
spreading themselves apart.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.915
The coolant's less dense.

00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:56.040
The structural materials
in the fuel and everything

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.042
are still there.

00:14:57.042 --> 00:14:58.500
They're less dense,
but there's not

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.120
fewer of them in the reactor.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.560
But there is going to be
less coolant in the reactor,

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.750
because it has the
ability to sparsify or get

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.730
less dense, and kind of
squeeze out the inlet

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.128
and outlet of the reactor.

00:15:10.128 --> 00:15:11.670
So what's really
going to happen here

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.680
is, we know diffusion
is going to go up,

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.280
which might cause a
corresponding change

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.540
in buckling.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.610
And the net effect,
as we would hope,

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.135
k effective would go down.

00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:26.760
And so what we've
talked about now here

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.340
is directly
controlling reactivity

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.910
with control rods, what's
called a void coefficient,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.430
where you actually want to have
a negative void coefficient.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.910
So if you boil your
coolant too much,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.310
k effective should go down.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.210
And that's one of the
mechanisms that a light water

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.290
or a thermal reactor can
help stabilize itself.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.540
And you can see that now from
just a really simplified one

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.557
group criticality relation.

00:15:51.557 --> 00:15:53.140
And if you raise the
fuel temperature,

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.290
let's say the fuel gets
really hot because there's

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.360
been some power
spike, you also want

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.330
the reactor to shut itself down,
which you can see that it does.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.380
Let's make things
a little trickier.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.060
Let's now talk about
a sodium reactor.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.470
Fast reactor.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:29.710
This one relies a lot more
on fast fission of U238.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:36.120
So if we were to draw the two
cross-sections of 235 sigma

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.980
fission and 238 sigma fission--

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.200
remember, uranium 235
looked like the one

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:52.030
that we drew before, whereas
U238 goes something like that,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.190
with no actual scale given.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.350
I'm not going to even go there.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.430
But uranium 238 does not need
moderation for the neutrons

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.860
to induce more fission.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.329
So let's now write the same
criticality reaction, which,

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.470
again, is a super simplified
view of things, but that's OK.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.319
What would happen to each
of these terms in a sodium

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.319
fast reactor if you
void the coolant?

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.588
So nu won't change.

00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:33.630
What about sigma fission?

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.300
Well, if the coolant goes
away, then on average

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.210
there is fissile
materials contributing

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.870
more to that cross-section,
but not that much.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.120
So if you want to
get technical, might

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.900
be the slightest of increases,
but doesn't matter that much.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.240
What really matters, though,
is the stuff on the bottom.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.660
Sodium does have a low, but
non-negligible absorption

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.230
cross-section.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.410
So if the sodium
were to boil away,

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.290
then the absorption
would go down

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.510
by a non-negligible amount.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.480
And then what about diffusion?

00:18:26.427 --> 00:18:28.260
Well, we've got the
formula for it up there.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.720
If there's not as much
coolant in the way,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.230
then the neutrons
are going to be

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.880
able to get further on average.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.047
Let's say, they're not going
to be scattering around

00:18:42.047 --> 00:18:43.250
with as much of the sodium.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.360
So there might be a small
increase in diffusion

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.090
and corresponding small
increase in buckling.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:54.190
But this is where the
one group kind of fails.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.990
What the sodium
is actually doing

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.080
is providing a little
bit of moderation,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.740
so that some of those neutrons
when they bounce off of sodium

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.030
leave the fast fission
region and get absorbed.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.360
And that's part of the
balance of the reactor.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.060
If all of the neutrons
are then born fast

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.100
and don't really slow down
and just get absorbed,

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:20.140
then you might have an overall
positive void coefficient.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.720
So this would tell you that
in a fast reactor where you're

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.670
depending on your
coolant not just to cool

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.580
the reactor, but
to absorb somewhat

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.310
and to moderate
somewhat, you don't

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.450
want to boil the coolant
in a fast reactor.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.860
And is a lot of the reason
why most fast reactor

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.950
coolants tend to have
extremely high boiling points.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.850
Sodium is approximately
893 Celsius.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.350
Lead bismuth is
approximately 1,670 Celsius.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.240
Molten salt, about
1,400 Celsius.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.337
So all those coolant,
except for the sodium one,

00:19:53.337 --> 00:19:55.420
you'll melt the steel that
the reactor is made out

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.370
of before your boil the coolant.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.700
So boiling the coolant is a
bad day in a fast reactor,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.340
because then things will
go from bad to worse,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.270
because in this case, the
feedback coefficient can

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.750
be positive for
voiding the coolant.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.990
That's no good.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.793
So you want to keep
the reactor submerged.

00:20:13.793 --> 00:20:16.210
And that's another reason why
a lot of these fast reactors

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.460
are what's called,
pool-type reactors.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.230
The reactor is not a
vessel with a bunch

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.350
of piping under it that
can break and fail,

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:29.500
but instead it's designed as
a huge pool of liquid sodium.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.030
And then the core is somewhere
in here with a bunch of pumps

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.230
sending the coolant in and
back out, or through some heat

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.830
exchange or something.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.100
So there's not really
any penetrations

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.810
on the bottom up this pool.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.300
And you make sure
that you maintain,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.230
either when you have
sodium or lead bismuth

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.640
eutectic, or liquid lead,
or some other fast reactor

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.792
coolant.

00:20:56.792 --> 00:20:58.750
So these are some kind
of interesting scenarios

00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:59.390
to think about.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.930
I think one of them that
I put in the homework was

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.030
imagine you have the
MIT reactor and replace

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.250
the coolant with molten sodium.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.810
What's going to happen?

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.880
Well, let's say you got
all the water out first

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.010
and it wouldn't just blow up.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.538
What would actually happen
to the criticality relation?

00:21:14.538 --> 00:21:16.330
That's something I want
you to think about,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.288
because one of the big
problems on the homework

00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:20.410
is doing exactly
this for scenarios

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.167
that have happened
to the MIT reactor,

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:24.250
except for the sodium one.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.500
That's never happened
and hopefully never will.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.010
I can't even imagine.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.760
But now let's talk a
little bit about when

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.910
you perturb a reactor by
doing something to it,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.130
putting the control rods
in, or pulling them out,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.750
or doing whatever you want.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.750
You're by definition
going to take

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:49.830
one of our first assumptions
about how the neutron diffusion

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.860
equation works and
throw it out the window.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.575
So we're now moving into
the transient regime.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.100
So to study what happens
in a reactor transient

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.770
or when something changes
as a function of time,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:11.700
let's first go from k effective
to what we call k infinity.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.183
The multiplication factor
for an infinite medium.

00:22:17.183 --> 00:22:18.600
We're only doing
this because it's

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.370
analytically easier
to understand

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.480
and still gets the point across.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.980
So we'll say that our
k infinity is still

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.868
a balance between
production and destruction.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.020
The difference is if we
have an infinite medium,

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.540
there's no leakage.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.030
You can't leak out of an
infinitely sized reactor,

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.980
should one ever exist.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.090
And so it just comes
out as nu sigma fission

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.800
over sigma absorption.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.270
A much simpler form.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.400
And so now we can
write what would

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.540
happen to the flux in the
reactor as a function of time.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.680
In this case, it's going
to be one over velocity.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.920
I'm going to make this a very
obvious wide v. That change

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.830
in the reactor flux is going
to just be proportional

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.790
to the imbalance now in the
number of neutrons produced

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.110
and destroyed.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.520
So the number of
neutrons produced

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.350
will be proportional
to very sharp nu sigma

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.410
fission minus the number
of neutrons destroyed,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:29.310
sigma absorption, times
phi is a function of t.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.270
Y'all with me so far?

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:38.500
So this right here
is a change, which

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:46.470
is proportional to an
imbalance between production

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.830
and destruction, times
the actual flux that you

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.750
have in some given time.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.710
So to make this simpler,
let's multiply everything

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:01.520
by v. Where's my green
substitute color?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.390
Multiply everything by v.
And the only unfortunate

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.980
situation is we have a v
and a nu next to each other.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.390
I'm going to try to keep them
looking really different.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.290
Those go away.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:23.500
And then we end up with,
if we divide by phi,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.170
then those phi's go away.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:36.460
And we have phi prime over
phi, equals v nu sigma fission,

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:41.410
minus v sigma absorption.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.030
And now we can start
to define things

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.730
in terms of our
k infinity factor

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.060
and a new quantity
I'd like to introduce

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.080
called the prompt lifetime.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.910
It's a measure of how long a
given neutron tends to live

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.290
before something happens to it.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.620
Before it's either absorbed
or leaks out, well, not

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.580
from our infinite reactor.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.900
And so we can define this as
1 over their neutron velocity,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.700
times sigma absorption.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.220
And just to check
the units here--

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.110
velocities in meters per second.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:19.810
Macroscopic cross-sections
are in 1 over meters.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.590
So those cancel
out, and we're left

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.650
with a total units of seconds.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.190
That's nice.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.490
We would want a mean
neutron lifetime,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:36.310
or a prompt lifetime to have
of seconds or time, at least.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.017
Yep.

00:25:37.017 --> 00:25:39.309
AUDIENCE: Can you say again
why the [INAUDIBLE] squared

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:40.117
went away?

00:25:40.117 --> 00:25:42.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Why the d
phi dt squared went away?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.910
AUDIENCE: No, the
[INAUDIBLE] square.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.840
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, OK.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.030
So that's because
we assume we're

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.460
going to be analyzing
an infinite medium.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.990
So right here, this to
relabel these terms,

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.790
this would be the
total production term.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.430
That right there
represents absorption.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.100
And that right there
represents leakage.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.440
But if we're analyzing
an infinite medium,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.980
you can't leak out, because it
takes up the entire universe

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.810
and beyond, depending on what
you believe metaphysically.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.850
That's different costs.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:30.420
So this right here, we can
rewrite as 1 over lifetime.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.400
That makes it easier.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:39.580
And this right here,
if we note that nu--

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.270
that's a nu.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.895
I'm going to be really
explicit about that.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.740
Nu sigma fission over
sigma absorption.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.750
This kind of looks like this
is looking to be like k--

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.350
wrong color.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.030
--like our k infinity over lp.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.710
So all of a sudden we of
a much simpler relation.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:15.600
We have 5 prime over 5
equals k infinity minus 1

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.180
over the prompt
neutron lifetime.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.980
So if we solve this, this
is just an exponential.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:27.170
So we end up with our phi
as a function of t is--

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.540
whatever flux we started
at, like for your power

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.380
in manipulations, it would be
whatever the neutron flux was

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.760
before you touch the control
rod, times e to the t,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:47.370
or e to the that stuff, k
infinity minus 1 over lp,

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:56.718
times t, which we can
rewrite as t over capital T.

00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:58.510
We're going to define
this symbol as what's

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.650
called the reactor period.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.530
What the reactor
period actually says

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:24.410
is how long before the flux
increases by a factor of e.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.610
And so this is actually
what that meter

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.860
was measuring on the reactor.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.120
It's the reactor
period or the time

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.190
it would then take for
the reactor's power

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.280
to increase by a factor of e
because it's an exponential.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.540
To tell you what these
typical reactor periods tend

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:52.310
to be for a thermal
reactor, t is

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:58.850
about 0.1 seconds corresponding
to an average prompt neutron

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:04.800
lifetime of 10 to
the minus 4 seconds.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.780
Seems fast, doesn't it?

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.400
Like, really fast.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.040
So the question I asked you
guys is, why don't reactors

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.089
just blow up?

00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:14.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.130
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes,
there is something

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.480
we've neglected from here.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.380
It's like what Sarah said.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.630
And it deserves its own board.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.535
There is a fraction
of delayed neutrons.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.250
We'll give that fraction
the symbol, beta.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:43.530
And for a uranium 235,
it equals about 0.0064.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.890
So there's less than a percent
of all the neutrons coming out

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.190
of a reactor have some delay
to them, because they're not

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:54.450
made directly from fission in
the 10 to the minus 14 seconds

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.430
that we talked about
in the timeline.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.220
But they come out of
radioactive decay processes

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:12.070
with delayed lifetimes
ranging from about 0.2 seconds

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.585
to about 54 seconds.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.370
This is the whole reason why
reactors don't just blow up.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.700
So you can actually make a
reactor go super critical.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:33.270
But if the k effective
is less than 1 plus beta,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:38.147
then the reactor is not what
we call prompt super critical.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.080
And so the reason for that is,
let's say you raise the reactor

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:56.340
power by some amount and the
k effective goes up to 1.005,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.940
there's still this fraction
0.0064 of the neutrons

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.970
are not going to be
released immediately.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.370
They're going to be released not
in 10 to the minus 14 seconds,

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.350
but in 10 to the 2 seconds.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.170
So a measly 15
orders of magnitude

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.660
slower, meaning that
there's actually

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.890
some ability for this reactor
to raise its power level.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.810
And these delayed neutrons,
even though that's

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.990
such a small fraction,
takes the reactor period

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:27.350
from its t infinity value
of about 0.1 seconds

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.550
to about 100 seconds.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.260
So the same reactor
when you account

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.440
for the delayed neutrons
increases in power

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.343
by a factor of e.

00:31:37.343 --> 00:31:39.260
And it takes it about
100 seconds, which means

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.002
this is totally controllable.

00:31:42.002 --> 00:31:43.460
Now I have a question
for you guys.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.670
Would you guys like me
to derive this formula,

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.740
or do you want to go into
more of the intuitive

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.730
implications of it?

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.960
Because we can go either way.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.120
There is a formula
that will tell you

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.240
what the reactor period and
time dependence will be.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.590
And you will hit it
in 22.05 probably.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.850
I can't guarantee it
because I'm not teaching it.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.370
Or we can talk a little bit
more about some of the intuition

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.610
behind delayed neutrons.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.680
So a bit of choose
your own adventure.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.730
Math or intuition?

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.720
AUDIENCE: Intuition.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.762
MICHAEL SHORT: Intuition.

00:32:14.762 --> 00:32:16.450
OK, that's fine.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.740
Good.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.300
So that was the derivation.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.790
I'll post that anyway,
if you guys want to see.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.270
I think in the Yip reading
it says, let's account

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.950
for the delayed neutrons.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.340
Intuitively we find that
the answer ends up being--

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.350
so I'll skip the derivation.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:44.270
And it comes out to phi
naught e to the beta minus 1,

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:54.740
times k minus 1 over lt, plus
beta phi naught over beta minus

00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:01.940
1k, minus 1, times 1 minus e
to the beta minus 1k, minus 1

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.110
over l.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.145
OK, so left as an
exercise to the reader--

00:33:07.145 --> 00:33:08.270
AUDIENCE: That's intuitive.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.490
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
that's intuitive.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.098
But let's actually talk
about how intuitive it is.

00:33:13.098 --> 00:33:15.140
I do want to give you the
starting and the ending

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.530
equation.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.750
And we will not go
through the rest.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.240
Yeah, Charlie?

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.590
AUDIENCE: Should
we copy that down?

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.530
MICHAEL SHORT:
No, you shouldn't.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.947
I'm going to scan
it for you guys.

00:33:20.947 --> 00:33:22.610
So don't bother copying it down.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:24.530
Let's talk about
where it comes from.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.990
And the answer may
astound you because we're

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.540
going to bring right back the
idea of series radioactive

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.690
decay.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:35.450
So let's say you want
to relate the change

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:41.020
in the number in the
neutron flux to a 1 minus--

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.700
I'm going to take a quick
look at the original equation

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.717
because I don't want
to screw that up.

00:33:46.717 --> 00:33:48.800
That's the first page, and
that's the one we want.

00:33:51.132 --> 00:33:53.340
Let's say we had some
equations that looked something

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:53.970
like this.

00:34:00.802 --> 00:34:05.710
Phi plus phi naught times beta.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.750
This is the original
differential equation

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.403
from whence it came.

00:34:09.403 --> 00:34:11.320
And the intuitive part
that I want you to note

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:16.060
is that the jump from
changing k effective

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:20.719
is moderated by this term
right here, 1 minus beta.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:29.090
So that's the fraction
of prompt neutrons,

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.100
that as soon as you pull
the control rod out,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.281
that's your
instantaneous feedback.

00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:35.239
By instantaneous, I mean
on the order of, like,

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.980
10 to the minus 4
seconds, or something

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.929
that you can't really control.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.104
This right here represents
the delayed fraction.

00:34:44.873 --> 00:34:47.040
This is as mathy as it's
going to get because you've

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.150
chosen intuition.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:49.929
I think you have chosen wisely.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.570
It's going to be a more fun.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.060
So what this
represents right here

00:34:54.060 --> 00:35:02.090
is your kind of instant change,
because whatever you change

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.040
k effective to, it's
going to be moderated

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.000
by the prompt fraction, how
long the neutrons tend to take

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.090
to undergo that feedback.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:09.590
Yes, Sara?

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.087
AUDIENCE: Was that the average?

00:35:11.087 --> 00:35:12.420
MICHAEL SHORT: The average what?

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.625
AUDIENCE: Average
neutron lifetime.

00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:17.000
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, this is
the average neutron lifetime.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.300
So let's define the
average neutron lifetime

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:27.580
as simply 1 minus beta times
the prompt neutron lifetime,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:36.680
plus the beta times some
delayed neutron lifetime.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.160
So what no book I've
ever seen actually says,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.910
this is what's referred to
as a Maxwell mixing model.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.030
It's just the simplest
thing to say, oh,

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.030
if you want to get the
average of some variable,

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.080
take the fraction of one
species times its variable,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.750
plus the fraction of the other
species, times its variable.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.420
Folks do the same thing
with electrical resistivity,

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.180
thermal conductivity, or
any sort of other material

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.140
property.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.570
And it is or isn't good
in some situations.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.840
Like, if you had a piece
of material made out

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.030
of two different things--

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.550
let's say this had
thermal conductivity k1,

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.750
and it had thermal
conductivity K2.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.290
Would a Maxwell mixing model
be appropriate to describe

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.080
the flow of heat
across this thing?

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.550
Probably not.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.000
But in the case
of neutrons where

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.260
they're flying about like crazy
and their mean free path is

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.470
much larger than the
distance between atoms,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.090
this works great.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:50.870
So we can define this
mean neutron lifetime

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.400
and use that in this
equation right here.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.580
So this term right
here describes

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.840
the instantaneous change.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.510
You pull the control
rods out, and fraction 1

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:03.740
minus beta neutrons
respond immediately.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.970
What about that
fraction of neutrons?

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.240
Those are being produced
with a fraction beta

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.610
depending on what
the flux was before,

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.640
because they're still waiting to
decay from the old power level.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.980
Does anyone notice anything
suspiciously familiar

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:30.810
about the final form of
this equation for flux?

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.420
You've seen it
before with a couple

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.070
of constants changed around.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.324
What about the form of
this differential equation?

00:37:42.324 --> 00:37:43.710
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.860
It is exactly the same as
series radioactive decay.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.920
So the horrible derivation I
was going to do for you guys

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.910
and we're not anymore is,
use an integrating factor.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.430
You solve it in
exactly the same way.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.650
You bring everything to
one side of the equation.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:03.000
Find some factor mu, that
makes this a product rule.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.590
Do a lot of algebra.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.610
And you end up with a very
suspiciously similar looking

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:09.390
equation.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.350
So it's exactly the
same posing and solution

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.350
as series radioactive decay,
with the difference being,

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.240
that's the constant in
front of everything,

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.090
instead of a bunch of
lambdas and fluxes.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.600
So what this says here is that
the flux as a function of time,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.270
this is the prompt
feedback right here,

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.040
which says that
if-- let's graph it,

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.350
since we're going intuitive.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.430
There's no room.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.980
Even those all boards are full.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.340
OK, here we go.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.200
If we graft time
and flux right here,

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.993
what that part
right there says is

00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:47.410
that you're going
to get some sort

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.690
of instantaneous
exponential feedback.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.870
But it's going to be moderated
by this one minus exponential

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.920
on top.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:04.250
So you're going to end up with
a little bit of prompt feedback,

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:05.230
this stuff right here.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:15.150
And then-- have to draw longer
because it's going to take

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.970
forever--

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:22.010
you'll have some
delayed feedback,

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.550
because you've got to
wait 100 or so seconds,

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.690
or whatever that new
reactor period is,

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.685
for the delayed
neutrons to take effect.

00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:31.310
And that's the whole reason you
could pull the control rods out

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.540
at almost any speed you wanted
and the reactor doesn't just

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.800
explode.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.500
If you pull the control
rods out fast enough, such

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.370
that the change in k effective
is greater than beta,

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.370
then the reactor goes
prompt super critical,

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.190
which means you don't have any
delayed neutrons slowing down

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.360
the feedback.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.010
And you've kind of turned
your reactor into a weapon.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.630
A very poor,
terrible weapon, but

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.550
a prompt super critical
nuclear device, nonetheless.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.300
Did anybody pull out the
control rods too fast

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.747
and the controls
took over for you?

00:40:05.747 --> 00:40:07.080
What about you guys in training?

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.810
Did you ever do things when you
watched the automatic control

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.640
take over?

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.388
No?

00:40:12.388 --> 00:40:13.762
AUDIENCE: It'll just take over.

00:40:13.762 --> 00:40:16.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it'll kick you
off if you don't pay attention.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.477
MICHAEL SHORT:
That's what I mean.

00:40:17.477 --> 00:40:20.020
The machine takes over
and it will kick you off

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.280
and stop responding to you.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
horrible noise

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.520
and so we don't want that.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.663
It's more to avoid
an annoying alarm.

00:40:26.663 --> 00:40:27.550
MICHAEL SHORT: I see.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.170
But the annoying
alarm is to stop you

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.690
from doing something like that,
like, making the reactor go

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:32.607
prompt super critical.

00:40:32.607 --> 00:40:33.912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:33.912 --> 00:40:35.620
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so
that's what I would

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.090
call the machine taking over.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.942
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:40:38.942 --> 00:40:41.400
AUDIENCE: It'll kick you on to
manual, and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.547
still don't do
anything [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:43.547 --> 00:40:44.380
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.920
So if your blood alcohol
level is above beta

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.930
and you try and, let's
say, increase the reactor

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.750
reactivity too much, it
will then take over, insert

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.420
a control rod, make a horrible
noise, and say, go home,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.330
you're drunk.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.250
Something like that.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.660
OK, that makes sense to me.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.500
So what did your guys' reactor
power traces look like?

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.295
Did they look
something like this,

00:41:07.295 --> 00:41:09.670
where there was an initial
rise as you pulled the control

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.180
right out?

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.810
And then after you pulled the
control rod out the power kept

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.098
rising just a smidge, right?

00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:18.390
And what happened when you
put the control rod back in?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.960
Let's say you put the
control rod back in.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.990
You're going to get another
prompt drop, not equal

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.000
to the same prompt
gain that you got,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.900
because now the reactor's
at a different flux,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.280
and then some asymptotic
feedback like that.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.900
And so this is why to
those who don't understand

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.200
neutron physics, reactor
feedback is very non-intuitive.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.607
It's not a linear system.

00:41:42.607 --> 00:41:45.190
You can't just pull the control
right out and change the power

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.340
accordingly.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.600
This is why there's automated
controls in systems to stop you

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.610
in case, like I said,
if your blood alcohol

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.227
content's above beta, which
is very low, by the way.

00:41:55.227 --> 00:41:57.060
Though you shouldn't
be drinking on the job,

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.010
especially at a nuclear reactor.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.870
Plus, you're all under 21,
so what am I even saying?

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:03.800
AUDIENCE: What is alcohol?

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.450
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.470
Good answer.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.333
What is alcohol?

00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:10.500
AUDIENCE: Is that going to
be covered in [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.760
MICHAEL SHORT: That'll
be on the exam, yeah.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.380
AUDIENCE: What is alcohol?

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.380
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, cool.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.260
So that's all I want to go
into for the intuitive stuff.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.360
And it's about 5 of 5 of.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.240
So I'd like to stop here and see
if you guys have any questions

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.790
on neutron physics at a whole.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.790
Noting that we're going
to take Thursday's class

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.040
and turn into a recitation.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.800
So I would like all of you guys
to look at the problem set,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.510
because it is posted.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.860
It is hard.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.050
Trust me.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.582
This one's a doozy.

00:42:40.582 --> 00:42:42.290
So I want to warn you
guys because you've

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.640
got seven days to work on it.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.820
But I want you to look at it so
that we can start formulating

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.150
strategies for the problems
together on Thursday,

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.210
because there are
some tricks to it.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.160
You guys know me by now, right?

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.660
There's always some
sort of a trick.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.610
Like, do you have to
integrate every energy

00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.720
to get the stopping power?

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.103
No, you actually don't have
to do any integrals at all.

00:43:02.103 --> 00:43:03.770
But you can if you
want, and your answer

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.210
will be more
accurate and correct.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.220
It'll just take
longer to get to.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.340
So there's a lot of diminishing
returns on these problems sets.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.140
If you're willing
to take an hour

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.670
and think about
how can I do this

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.640
simpler and with
fewer decimal points,

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.670
you're probably onto something.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.190
And we'll work on those
strategies together.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.420
AUDIENCE: Is this due
next Monday as well?

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.890
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.453
So I posted it yesterday
at around noon or whatever

00:43:27.453 --> 00:43:28.370
the Stellar site says.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:36.710
I'll also teach you guys
explicitly how to use Janus.

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.070
So we got a comment in from
the anonymous feedback saying,

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.813
we have to use a
lot of software.

00:43:41.813 --> 00:43:43.730
Can we have some sort
of tutorial for dummies?

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.563
Well, you guys aren't
dummies, but you still

00:43:45.563 --> 00:43:46.500
deserve a tutorial.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.520
So I will show you how
to export the data you'll

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.530
need from this
problem set for Janus.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.960
So you can focus on the
intuition and the physics

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.450
and not get frustrated with
getting data out of a computer.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.370
So any questions on anything
from the neutron diffusion

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.420
equation?

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.050
Yeah, Luke.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.816
AUDIENCE: I'm not real clear
on [INAUDIBLE] neutrons are

00:44:07.816 --> 00:44:10.300
and how those are different
from the prompt neutrons?

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.717
MICHAEL SHORT: The
prompt neutrons

00:44:11.717 --> 00:44:12.950
come right out of fission.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.010
If we looked at
that timeline of,

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.350
let's say the fission
event happens here.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:23.870
Two fission products
are released in about 10

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.870
to the minus 14 seconds.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:30.090
They move a little
further apart.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.420
And then some of them
just boil off neutrons,

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.170
because they're so neutron
heavy, after around 10

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.500
to the minus 13 seconds or so.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.740
These right here
are prop neutrons,

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.310
coming directly from the
immediate decay of neutron

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.900
rich fission products.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.560
Some of the delayed neutrons
come from radioactive decay,

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.050
but of the much later
fission products

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.830
with much less
likely occurrences,

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.840
which is why the
fraction is very low.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.630
But also, because it's
much longer half life,

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.150
those delayed neutrons
take seconds, instead

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.115
of pico seconds, to show up.

00:45:07.115 --> 00:45:10.310
And that's the whole basis
behind easier control

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.170
and feedback a reactor.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.840
Good question.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.360
So anything starting
from neutron transport

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.670
to simplifying to
neutron diffusion,

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.340
to getting to this
criticality condition,

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.770
making the two group
criticality condition if you

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:28.160
want to have fast and thermal,
or any of the time dependent

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.630
stuff that we intuited today.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:32.130
Yeah?

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.088
AUDIENCE: So for that
cross-section [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:34.088 --> 00:45:36.885
you have there, so you have
one for 235 and one for 238.

00:45:36.885 --> 00:45:41.348
235, it has to be thermal
neutrons [INAUDIBLE] fast?

00:45:41.348 --> 00:45:42.140
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.182
AUDIENCE: And you said
that [INAUDIBLE] different

00:45:44.182 --> 00:45:45.760
[INAUDIBLE] as well it had--

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.653
if you have
[INAUDIBLE] into the--

00:45:49.653 --> 00:45:51.320
MICHAEL SHORT: Was
it on the other board

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.139
or from a different day?

00:45:52.139 --> 00:45:53.597
AUDIENCE: It was
a different board.

00:45:53.597 --> 00:45:55.840
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.018
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so could
you explain that graph?

00:45:59.018 --> 00:45:59.810
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:02.442
So in this case--

00:46:02.442 --> 00:46:06.650
let me get a finer chalk.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.930
This blue one would be
for low temperature,

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.990
and this red one would
be for high temperature.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.910
So this blue graph,
there are resonances,

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.630
which have very high values,
but they're very narrow.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.900
And because the width of a
resonance doesn't matter,

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.460
it doesn't affect
the probability

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:27.030
that a neutron scatters up
here and moves some distance

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.680
down the energy spectrum.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.020
Thinner resonances tend
to get passed over,

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.510
especially if your reactor's
full of hydrogen. Some

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.300
of those neutrons will
be born and immediately

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.730
jump into the
thermal region, where

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.580
it's easy to tell how much
fission they'll undergo.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.800
As you go up in
temperature, you undergo

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:53.990
what's called Doppler
broadening, which

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:57.680
causes these resonances to
spread out and also go down

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.830
in value.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.250
So the actual value
of the cross-section

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:05.700
at these residences is lower,
but the widths are larger.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.630
So there's a higher probability
that a neutron scattering

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.850
around and losing
energy will hit

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.610
one of these higher
cross-section regions, called

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:18.340
a resonance, at a
higher temperature.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.740
That's the difference there,
is these two plots show

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:25.450
the same cross-section at
low and high temperature.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:29.410
These plots show the
difference between uranium 235

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:33.190
and uranium 238.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:34.390
Good question.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.960
Anyone else?

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.550
Cool.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.670
OK, for the first
time in history,

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:47.220
I'll let you out a minute early.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.410
Bring all your
questions on Thursday.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.870
So we'll start off
with a Janus tutorial.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:54.756
And then we'll start attacking
this problem set together.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning. Good morning,
yes, thank you. Well, we were

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
coming to the end of the
term rather soon. That's sad.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And, what I'd like to do today is,
picking up on some of the stuff that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Bob has been doing, begin
to show how the things we've

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
learned about understanding
molecular biology,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
biochemistry, genetics, all
come together to help us treat

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
disease. That is after
all the point of all this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Bob spoke about this with respect
to cancer. Today my goal is to talk

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
about this with respect to heart
disease. We've got about 50 minutes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or so, and I'd like to see if we
could solve heart disease by the end

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of the period. That seems
like a reasonable goal.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so, I would like you,
by the end of today's class,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to design a therapy to cure most
people or at least to prevent a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
couple million heart attacks,
all right? So, that's our goal.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, we'd better get to work if
we're going to accomplish that in

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the allotted time. So,
first off, you need to know a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
little something
about heart disease.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The heart: that's obviously an
important component of understanding

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
heart disease.
What's the heart do?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The heart pumps blood, and
to and from tissues providing

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
nutrients, hormones,
removing waste products,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
cells, for example, it pumps
around red blood cells and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
white blood cells and things like
that, and of course oxygen in the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
blood. These are incredibly
important things that your heart

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
does. If your heart should stop
doing it for even relatively brief

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
periods of time,
it's very bad news.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is extremely serious not
to have your heart pumping,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as you all know. One of
the ways in which you run

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
into trouble with your heart pumping
is if the vessels that carry blood

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
away from the heart to the
periphery arteries become clogged.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Just simple plumbing problem here:
if they become clogged and the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
arterial wall gets build ups
here, we have what is called

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
arteriosclerosis. And,
it can lead eventually to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
nearly complete blockade of
a vessel. And if that vessel,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
for example, were to be supplying
something important like,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
for example, the blood supply
to the heart muscles itself,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that would be extremely bad, all
right, because then your heart

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
muscles wouldn't have oxygen,
and they would quickly die.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Other problems can happen here too,
where you could have insufficient

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
blood supply to the brain.
What happens when your brain

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
doesn't get enough oxygen: stroke.
So, we have many, many of these

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
issues. So, if it's the brain:
stroke. If the tissue that doesn't

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
get enough oxygen is the heart,
you've got enough heart attack.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And so, we want to prevent this
process of the buildup of plaques in

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the arteries. And these plaques
are made up of complex mixtures of

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
proteins, lipids, and
cholesterol, and surely by now

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you all know that cholesterol
was this evil molecule,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and it will indeed be the
villain of today's story.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, that's the basic plan there.
I'll draw your basic plumbing

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
diagram here just so you have it.
We've got a heart here. This is

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
your heart, somewhat simplified
picture here. The heart pumps blood

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that goes out to the body, to
the heart itself, to the brain,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and of course this before it's
doing it is receiving oxygenated

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
blood from the lungs. So,
it's really all of these places

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that we're trying to keep flowing.
The number of heart attacks, deaths

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
from heart attacks, and other
cardiovascular disease is

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
extraordinarily high.
It's on the order of 1.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
million deaths per year. By
contrast, number of deaths from

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
cancer is about 600, 00
or so, something like that.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And, this has been coming down
a little bit for cardiovascular

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
disease partly because of some of
the things we'll talk about today.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But it still is a leading
killer of adults in this country,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and indeed the leading killer
of adults in this country,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
although there are projections that
cancer may take over in that role.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Heart disease is
incredibly important. So,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if we're going to try to understand
how we're going to prevent these

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
plaques, and I've told you already,
and you know from the media that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
these plaques have lots
of cholesterol in them,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and that you all know that
high cholesterol is bad,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
how do we know that
high cholesterol is bad?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Correlation. Epidemiological
correlation is one,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and as we will see today, there
are some other, more direct

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
results coming out of genetics
that point to this as well.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
What is cholesterol? Let's
talk about cholesterol.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So, this is
the structure

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:18.000
of cholesterol.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
There we go. That's cholesterol.
It's a very complex, interesting

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
molecule here with lots of rings.
It is a waxy substance. If you

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000
were to look at a test tube
with a lot of cholesterol in it,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it would look like wax. And,
it is extremely hydrophobic. It

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
will not dissolve in water. So,
if cholesterol is such an evil

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
molecule as you all know from
the news media, why do we have

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
this evil molecule?
Sorry? Well, because it's

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
absolutely essential for life. I
mean, despite it's rep as an evil

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
molecule, it's extraordinarily
important. The uses of cholesterol

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
are many. One you've already said.
It plays a structural role in cell

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
membranes, the plasma membrane.
This is not a big player role in the

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
cell membrane. But about
half of all the lipids in

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the cell membrane are cholesterol.
It's a huge component. Cholesterol

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
molecules, because of their funny
shape, helps stiffen membranes and

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
strengthen membranes. So they
strengthen and stiffen the

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
membrane. Also, not
only are half of the

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
lipids in your cell membranes
cholesterol, half of the cholesterol

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
in your body is in
the cell membranes. So,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that's the major location.
They're also used, these complex

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
molecules, as precursors for the
synthesis of steroid hormones.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Steroid hormones, of course,
also are evil these days.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Those of you who checked the New
York Times today saw that Jason

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Giambi admitted using steroids to
a grand jury. But steroids are also,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
notwithstanding those kinds
of things, good for you.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
What are some important steroids
in your bodies: testosterone,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
estrogen, glucocorticoids,
all of these things are made

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
from cholesterol.
It was a precursor.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And if you look at the
structure of steroid hormones,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you recognize that this coupled ring
structure here is very similar to

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
what's in them. And
indeed, they're derivatized

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
from them. It's also a precursor
for the synthesis of vitamin D.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And, it is a precursor for
the synthesis of bile acids.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
When your body takes in
triglycerides in your food supply

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and you need to transport fats like
triglycerides across your intestine,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
they need to be emulsified. The way
that triglycerides are emulsified

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
are with bile acids. So, you
secrete bile acids into your

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
digestive tract. It helps
emulsify fats and helps

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
you take them up. So,
cholesterol plays a crucial

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
structural role, a
biochemical role with regard to

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
hormones, with regard to vitamin D
synthesis, and with regard to bile

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
acid synthesis. So,
cholesterol was a good thing,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
all right. Now, if
cholesterol is so

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
extraordinarily hydrophobic,
how is it that cholesterol gets

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
around the body? It's
almost entirely non-polar.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It doesn't dissolve in water.
It has one little hydroxyl there.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's not going to help a lot. Yep?
Well, the first thing actually is

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
it's chemically modified to make
it a little hydrophilic and then it

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
does bind to hydrophilic
proteins and particles that help

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
get it around. So, the
first thing that happens,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to be able to, even just to store
cholesterol in any useful form,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
it's not stored as cholesterol
because it's so waxy.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It would just collapse as a waxy
deposit. What happens is it is

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
stored and transported
as cholesterol ester.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:43.000
A cholesterol ester,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:53.000
or CE, and its esterified by adding
to it, here's my cholesterol again.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I'll be even
less, there we go.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
This hydroxyl here is used
now for a fatty acid linkage.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And with this fatty acid
attached to the cholesterol,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.000
you have a cholesterol ester.
And this is somewhat more soluble.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
All right, where do you
get your cholesterol from?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Diet. Do we eat cholesterol?
Butter's got cholesterol. What

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:06.000
else has got cholesterol?
Eggs, a lot of cholesterol.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So, we eat cholesterol.
So, let's get our sources of

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:28.000
cholesterol: number one,
diet. And, sources, eggs,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000
butter, etc. What
else beyond diet?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Yeah? Your body actually makes it.
Your own endogenous synthesis. And

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
you would imagine that this is
pretty important because cholesterol,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
being half of all plasma membranes,
you can't just count on cholesterol

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
being sufficiently
there in your diet.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So, your body also synthesizes
cholesterol. The synthesis of

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
cholesterol is a thing of beauty.
It starts with an incredibly simple

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
molecule, acetic acid, right?
And it goes through many

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
steps and becomes cholesterol,
which I will summarize here as many

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
steps, OK? We'll come
back and talk a moment

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
about a few of those steps. But
it's one of these real triumphs

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
of biochemistry; the people have
worked out the whole pathway for

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
cholesterol biosynthesis. But
it's not, I think, necessary to

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
remember all of the steps there.
But it is quite remarkable to go

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
from such an extremely simple
molecule like acetic acid all the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
way to cholesterol. And the
fact that people worked all

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
this out was a great achievement.
All right, so those are some of the

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
things you need.
Then, carrying on here,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
we've got cholesterol coming
in by diet. We're synthesizing

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
cholesterol. We're
making cholesterol esters.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
We've got to get them
around the body. So now,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
we're going to take these
cholesterol esters and we're going

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to package them up and send them
off. So, you were saying that proteins

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.000
would be used. Hydrophilic
proteins might be used.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And indeed, that is the case.
Lipoproteins and lipoprotein

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:58.000
particles, lipo being fat, of
course, are used to transport

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:08.000
cholesterol and actually
triglycerins too.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000
They are transported in particles
that look roughly like this.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:33.000
They have a monolayer of
phospholipids with some protein

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:46.000
stuck in this monolayer
of phospholipid.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And, inside is where these
cholesterol esters go.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So, actually this is where
cholesterols go unesterified.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So, cholesterol goes in here. In
the cell, we want it esterified.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
When it's in the package,
it's unesterified. So we have a

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
monolayer of phospholipids.
We've got some protein stuck in

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that monolayer, and it's
a very little particle.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Now, these particles
come in different flavors.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
These are very creative
names: low-density lipoprotein

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000
particles, or LDL. There
are high density lipoprotein

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:01.000
particles, HDL, and very
low density lipoprotein

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
particles, VLDL, and
some other things called

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
kilomicrons. Now, you can
imagine that these names

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
were assigned based on not so much
information, just based on density,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
right? Somebody was purifying
lipoprotein particles and said,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
well, there are some that
are high density, low density,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
oh, and you just discovered
some very low density ones.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And this is not a highly
informative description of these

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
particles, right? So,
people later worked out that

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
these particles were really quite
different, and particularly the

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
proteins that are in them, and
those proteins turn out to have

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
important addressing roles in
sending these particles to different

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
places. The ones that I'll be
interested in today are the LDL

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
particles. The LDL particles have
a particular protein in them that is

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
called apoprotein
B-100. It doesn't matter,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
but that's the particular targeting
protein there that's in that.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And these particles are very
large. They are about two and a half

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
million Daltons, about
220 angstroms in size,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and each of them contains
about 1, 00 cholesterols.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
That's a description of
these LDL particles, OK?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So, cholesterol, if it's
going to be transported in

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000
the blood, gets packaged up
into LDL particles, and it gets

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000
sent off to cells. How does
cholesterol get taken up by

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
cells from these LDL particles?
How is that cell going to take up

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
an LDL particle: a receptor,
right? It stands to reason that

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
there's going to be a receptor
that's going to recognize probably

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
the protein on the surface of this
thing that'll recognize that and

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
internalize this particle. Now,
this stands to reason to us to

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
you guys because you guys are
highly sophisticated about all this.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
But how was it that people came to
know this, to find these receptors?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Well here is a little bit of
an interesting story about how,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
not so long ago, when people didn't
have all the tools in molecular

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
biology and all this? And
very few of these cellular

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
receptors were known. Two
young medical students began

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
studying a fascinating condition.
The young medical students were

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
named Joe Goldstein and Mike Brown.
And in fact, at least early in

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
their careers they were
working here in Boston. So,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
they studied a fascinating condition
called familial hypercholesterolemia.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
What does hypercholesterolemia
mean? Cholesterol, hyper, a lot of

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
cholesterol, emia,
in the blood, right?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So, a lot of cholesterol in
the blood was this condition.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And it was characterized, as
you might guess, by the fact that

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
patients had a lot of cholesterol in
the blood and that it was familial,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
meaning what? It
transmitted in families.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
In fact, it transmitted in
families like a Mendelian trait,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and it transmitted as an
autosomal co-dominant trait.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:27.000
In particular,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
if we looked at most
individuals in the population,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
which we'll assume have
genotype plus over plus,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and we look at their cholesterol
levels, what we find is maybe they

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
have 150 mg per desalude.
Now, some people have higher

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
cholesterols than that, but
I'm going to take that as an

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
average. Individuals who,
by virtue of their genetics,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
appear to be FH over plus
heterozygotes would have

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
cholesterols more like
300 mg per desalude,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
or about double the normal
level. And, individuals who are FH

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000
homozygotes, FH over FH based on
the pedigree analysis here would have

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
greater than 600
milligrams per desalude.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
In terms of heart attacks, normal
individuals would have heart

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
attacks at the normal age.
That doesn't say anything,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
does it, because the normal
individuals, the age at which they

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
have heart attacks is defined
as the normal age. But,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
what you will know that's striking
is that individuals who are

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
heterozygotes would tend to have
heart attacks 10-20 years earlier

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
than normal age. And,
individuals who are homozygotes

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
would tend to have heart
attacks below the age of 20.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000
So this might be heart attacks
when you're 60. This might be heart

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
attacks in your 40s and 50s, and
this might be heart attacks in

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
your 20s or teens. In
addition, some of these

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
individuals have very big
cholesterol deposits and things like

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
that. So, this was a very striking
phenotype: simple Mendelian trait,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
autosomal co-dominant, and
to see teenagers or younger,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
kids under the age of ten with
massively occluded vessels,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and serious heart disease, and dying
of heart attacks was very striking.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
So, Brown and Goldstein decided
that if we wanted to understand

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
heart disease in the general
population, we should understand

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
heart disease in patients with
familial hypercholesterolemia,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
particularly the homozygotes. Now,
I note that this is about one per

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
one million individuals. And
you could make a pretty strong

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
case that Brown and Goldstein are
out of their minds trying to study

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
familial hypercholesterolemia at
a frequency of one in a million and

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
try to imagine that that's going to
tell them about heart disease in the

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
general population. All
right, and people made that

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
case to them and said, what
are you doing? Let's see,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
if this is P2, that means
the frequency of the,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Q2, the allele is one in a
thousand in the population, right?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
If one in a million people are
homozygotes, the allele is one in 1,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
00. And so, the heterozygote
should be about one in 500.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Well, OK, so one in 500's not a
terrible, it's not a small number.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
One in 500 people are heterozygotes
for FH. That's maybe a little

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
better, but still not even a percent.
It's a fifth of a percent of the

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
population are heterozygotes for FH.
It's still something of a gamble to

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
imagine that by studying this
relatively rare disease we're going

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
to learn about stuff in
the general population.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But, Brown and Goldstein
felt strongly that they would.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And they did. They wanted to know,
what was the problem with these

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
individuals? Did they have
problems synthesizing their LDL?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Did they have problems degrading
LDL? Why was there so much LDL

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
cholesterol in the blood stream?
Maybe they didn't take up the LDL

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
from the blood stream.
What was wrong? And so,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
they studied just
these individuals.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And what they found, to
make an interesting and long

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
story short was that when they
studied the binding of radioactive

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
LDL particles to cells from these
patients, they found that the

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
homozygotes were virtually
unable to take up LDL particles.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
There was very low uptake of LDL
particles. They also found that the

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
heterozygotes had only about half
the normal uptake of LDL particles.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
What's your hypothesis about
what the problem is? Sorry?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Well, it's with the uptake, and
what do you think the genetic

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
basis of this is?
Yep? Well, let's see,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
if there's zero in the homozygote,
half the level in the heterozygote,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
could be the receptor. And what
could be the problem with receptor?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Mutation of the receptor gene.
What if homozygotes or FH had a

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
mutation that
abolished the receptor?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
OK, that turned out to be the case.
Was the FH was due to mutations in

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
the LDL receptor on cells?
And indeed, until this point,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
the LDL receptor hadn't
been characterized on cells,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
but by virtue of Brown and Goldstein
demonstrating that when they did

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000
radioactive labeled
LDL uptake assays,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and they found that FH
homozygotes had no uptake,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
virtually no uptake, and that
the heterozygotes had half

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the normal level, and that
the wild type individuals,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
plus over plus, had the normal level,
they inferred that the gene product

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
that was mutant in these
individuals encoded the LDL receptor.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And they proceeded to clone this
gene product, and determined that

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
the gene product encoded a protein
that sat on the cell surface.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
It had a cytoplasmic tale.
It had an extracellular tale,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
and what it did was it bound
to the apo B-100 protein on

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
the LDL particle. When it
bound the cell made a little

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000
pit, and in this coded pit, it
came and internalized the LDL

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
receptor, carrying with it
the LDL particle. And then,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000
this then went into the cell. The
LDL particle was then degraded,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.000
releasing cholesterol that
could be used by the cell.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And the receptor itself got recycled
back to the surface to work another

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
day. And this is quite a general
mechanism that is used there by a

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
lot of trafficking receptors like
this that grab things from the cell

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
surface, bring them into the cell,
release something into a vesicle,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
and then go back onto the surface
there, and that the problem was that

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
patients FH did not have
functional LDL receptors.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Now, this pointed out, LDL
receptors were very important

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
here because cells needed to take
up cholesterol from the blood stream,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
although they could make
some of their own cholesterol.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
But one of the most important
places where cholesterol was

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
sequestered and taken up from
the blood stream was the liver.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:09.000
It turns out that the biggest
problem for these patients with

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000
familial hypercholesterolemia was
that the liver is supposed to be

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.000
taking up large amounts of LDL to
clear the blood stream and keep the

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
levels of LDL at the desirable
amount. So, the liver normally is

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:45.000
responsible for taking up clearing
about 75% of LDL from the blood.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
If someone has, and other
cells are responsible for

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
the rest, non-liver cells
take up about 25% of the LDL.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Suppose somebody has half
the level of LDL receptors,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
they will take up half as
much of these LDL particles,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
and the average level in the
blood would be much higher, about

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
twofold higher. Suppose
somebody has no LDL

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
receptors. Well, then the
LDL receptor pathway is not

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
going to take up these particles,
and they're going to have

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
outrageously high levels of LDL.
Other mechanisms will kick in and

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
slightly prevent it from
going to infinity, of course,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
because there are other
ways things get cleared out.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
But they get huge levels
of LDL because they have no

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
such receptors. So, this
is the major reason that

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
there's so much LDL cholesterol
particles in the blood in these

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
patients who are FH homozygotes.
And then, FH heterozygotes have a

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
lot. And, well, what are
we going to do about it?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
How do you solve a problem like
this? The liver is not doing its

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
job. Now, I should note, the
liver does one other thing.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
the liver not only is the major
source of taking cholesterol,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
but it's the major source of
producing LDL cholesterol as well.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
The liver produces, I
remember every cell is able to

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
synthesize cholesterol, but
most of the cholesterol in the

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
body is synthesized from the
liver and put out. And so,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
here we have the liver is
a source of cholesterol,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
and it's in this disease not
acting as an appropriate sake for a

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
cholesterol. It ought to be sucking
up cholesterol and maintaining a

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
balance of producing cholesterol
and soaking it back up there.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
We've got a real problem. Well,
we need to know one more fact,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
and then we can solve the disease.
Well, we're not going to solve the

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
disease, but we'll do
the best we can here. So,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
cholesterol synthesis, I
just want to tell you one more

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
fact about it and then toss you
the problem. Cholesterol synthesis,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
I said, was acetate,
acetic acid, goes to stuff,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000
and let me tell you just
a little bit more about it.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
It goes to acetyl CO-A, which
goes to HMG CO-A, which goes

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
to mevalonate, which goes
on to make cholesterol,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
and that the key committed step of
cholesterol synthesis is carried out

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
by an enzyme called
HMG CO-A reductase, OK?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Now you have all the facts. We
know we've got these particles

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
that contain cholesterol. We
understand that the liver makes

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
cholesterol, that you get
cholesterol from your diet.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
The liver makes cholesterol.
It takes up cholesterol. We have

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
some problems with its uptake of
cholesterol. Let's get to work and

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
design a therapy. How
are we going to do this?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
So, we've got patients
designing a rational therapy.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:45.000
OK, here's your
digestive tract.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:56.000
You've got some liver here
it's going to take up by

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:06.000
means of diet. It's going
to synthesize cholesterol.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000
It's going to use cholesterol
to make bile acids.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Those bile acids are going to help
bring back fats because it's going

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
to emulsify the fats. And so,
the bile acids get recycled.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It's going to put out cholesterol
to the body, and LDL particles are

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
going to get internalized into
the liver. So, we have our LDLs.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
OK, so has everybody got the
action? You take up a cholesterol,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
and fats, and things like
that through our diet.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
You've got some cholesterol in
our body. We synthesize cholesterol

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
from acetic acid. We
have this pathway here.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
We use cholesterol
to make bile acids.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
We take up cholesterol from the
blood stream, and all of these

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
things together working as a system
control how much cholesterol is in

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
your body, and most importantly,
how much cholesterol's in your blood

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
stream in the form of LDL particles.
OK, we have a patient. Maybe it's

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
a patient with FH homozygosity.
But let's start easier. Let's

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
start with a patient who's
a heterozygote for FH.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:45.000
What's our first advice? Eat
well, get plenty of exercise:

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:58.000
this is always good advice.
So, plan one, so strategy number

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:11.000
one: diet, dietary reduction
of cholesterol intake.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Eat less cholesterol.
It's a good bit of advice.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Stop eating eggs, whatever,
you have a serious condition,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
don't eat so much better. Does
it do much to reduce LDL levels?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
It turns out, not much.
Why doesn't it do much?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
What if I reduce dramatically
my intake of cholesterol?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Well, it only makes about a
10% reduction in LDL levels,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
which is not enough to get
close to normal. Why? Well,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
it turns out your body, number
one, gets more efficient at

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
taking up cholesterol from your diet.
So, you have some cholesterol there,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
and if you're eating less, it
takes up with higher efficiency

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
the cholesterol that's there.
Your body's good at doing things

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
like that. It also starts
synthesizing cholesterol.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Don't have enough cholesterol?
We'll make more cholesterol. So,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
the liver will make more cholesterol,
put cholesterol out into the blood

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
stream, and these guys can't take
up the cholesterol with the LDL

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
receptor as well, and
it clogs it up again.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
So in the end, between more
efficient uptake of what is in the

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
diet and greater synthesis,
we've got to complex the human

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
system with feedback, and all
you've tried to do is affect

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
one variable, dietary intake. And
the system regulates so that you

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
haven't made a very big dent
in the problem. All right,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
next strategy, let's try to deplete
some cholesterol from the body.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
If we could get some cholesterol
out of the body by some pathway,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000
we might be able to decrease the
overall levels of cholesterol.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So, where do we have access
to a cholesterol product here?

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
In the digestive system, we have
bile acids. Got any ideas of what

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
we could do about the bile acids?
Suppose we could somehow deplete

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
your bile acids while they're
in your digestive tract.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Then your body would not be
able to recycle those bile acids,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
but would have to make more bile
acids. And it would be a sink for

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
cholesterol, right? It would
start having to use up more

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
cholesterol to produce enough bile
acids because it would have to use

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
up more cholesterol. The
liver might have to work harder

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
to get cholesterol, you know,
synthesizing cholesterol,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
but it would also probably up
regulate its LDL receptors to try to

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
draw in more cholesterol
from the blood stream.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So, this was the clever idea.
Let's try to get ride of bile acids,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
or not completely rid of them, but
let's try to complete bile acids.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Therefore, the liver is going
to not be able to reuse them.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
It's going to have to make more
bile acids. It's going to need

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
cholesterol. And so it's going
to up regulate the gene for LDL

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
receptors and draw in more from the
blood stream. It turns out that you

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
can feed people bile acid binding
resins. It's perfectly fine.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Just eat them, and you can give
people bile acid binding resins.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So, strategy number two, and
what they will do is then they

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:49.000
will, in their feces, eliminate
some fraction of the bile

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000
acids and as a result they will
be able to get rid of some of their

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:04.000
cholesterol, and they will be
able to decrease their overall

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:14.000
cholesterol levels.
Does this work?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:28.000
It does, and you can get
maybe a 20-25% reduction. But

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:37.000
what's the problem? You can't
completely get rid of them,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
right, because they're necessary.
So, we'll be able to get rid of

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
some bile acids. That's
really the problem is,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
see, we're sitting here saying so
cleverly we're going to feed the

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
body less cholesterol. We're
going to draw cholesterol out

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
of the body by removing bile acids,
and force the liver to take up more

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
cholesterol from the
blood stream, right?

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And hopefully it'll help regulate
the gene. And it does help regulate

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
the gene. When starved for
cholesterol, cells up regulate their

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
LDL receptor gene and make
more LDL receptors. That works.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
But we've forgotten one aspect of
the system, and that was the liver

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
has another option, which
was synthesize its own

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
cholesterol. So, we've
got a complex system with

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
multiple feedbacks. We've
affected it at the level of

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
diet. We've affected at the
level here of drawing stuff out.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
We've managed to get some up
regulation the LDL receptor gene.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
But it's not enough because the
liver's choosing to make more

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
cholesterol through its
endogenous synthesis pathway.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
So, let's keep going.
What do you recommend?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Yes? Ooh, ooh, I like that. What
do you think will happen then?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
So, I won't make as much cholesterol.
What's the liver going to have to

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
do then? And it will up regulate
its LDL receptors to do that,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
take up more cholesterol
from the blood stream. So now,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
we back the liver into a corner,
right? It needs more cholesterol.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
We're going to inhibit the
synthesis of cholesterol,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
and therefore it's going
to go to its second source,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
which is uptake from the blood,
and it's going to induce more LDL

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
reception. Everybody got
your plan? So, let's see.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Strategy would be inhibit
cholesterol synthesis.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
This is in addition also
inhibit cholesterol synthesis.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And, you wanted to inhibit one
of those steps. Any preference of

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
where you'd like to inhibit the step?
How about the first committed step

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
of cholesterol synthesis?
So, how about H, M, G, CO-A

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:15.000
reductase inhibitors?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Well, it turns out that people
found HMG CO-A reductase inhibitors.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Lovastatin, a fungal product
inhibits HMG CO-A reductase.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And then, companies, Merck
and then many other companies,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
developed all sorts of what
are called statin drugs that

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
inhibit that enzyme. I would
venture to say that a large

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
fraction of your parents take
statin drugs to lower cholesterol.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And this is how it works. It
inhibits the endogenous synthesis

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
pathway at the step
HMG CO-A reductase. And,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
in addition, if they do things
like take bile acid binding resins,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
and there's some combinations of
those things, and also controlled

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
your dietary intake of cholesterol,
and FH heterozygote can get a 60%

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
reduction in LDL particle
loss. That is mighty good.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
That brings them down to normal.
Yeah? Yeah? Yep. So we're not

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
talking about totally removing it.
We're talking about decreasing it.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
We're bringing it back down
to a normal level. Well,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
it turns out that the cells out
there will up regulate their LDL

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000
receptors as well, and I
haven't focused on that.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
But they're taking care of
themselves. It turns out,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
you have to worry about all these
strategies. This is too clever by

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
half because you're going to
mess up things in the periphery.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
But it turns out the peripheral
cells take care of themselves.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
They'll up regulate their LDL
receptors enough to get things in.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And the big problem is that
the liver's not doing its job.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
But you have to do the clinical
tests to see that that's the case.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
This turns out to be a
strategy for FH heterozygotes.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
But I just said that many of
your parents take these drugs.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Most of your parents
aren't FH heterozygotes.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Perhaps none of your
parents are FH heterozygotes.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
That turned out to be one of the
most remarkable outcomes of studying

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
this rare genetic disease.
Well, as it turned out, this

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
strategy, which had been the
understanding that had been

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
developed from this exceedingly
rare genetic disease,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
and the strategy that had been
developed with an eye towards these

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
FH heterozygotes turns out to also
work in normal individuals with high

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
cholesterol not because of a
complete mutation in the LDL

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
receptor, but because of,
perhaps, other differences,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
genetic differences that are weaker.
And in fact, tens of millions of

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
people take these therapies that
were developed for this very rare

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
situation. This is a perfect
example of where understanding a

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
rare genetic disease points us
to the basis for a physiological

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
pathway, in particular, all
these feedback loops that allow

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
us to do something that
helps everybody. So,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
this has become a
major, major therapy.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Who were the only people who don't
benefit from this particular therapy

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
of tricking the body into up
regulating the LDL receptors?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Homozygotes, because they don't
have a gene to be up regulated.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
They don't have a functional
gene to be up regulated.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
And so, homozygotes need
something else. What do they need?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Gene therapy. The best idea that
people have here since the liver

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
regenerates tremendously would be
able to take out some liver cells,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
add back genes for LDL receptors,
and repopulate a liver with LDL

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
receptor transgenic cells.
And that would help them.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Anyway, this is meant to illustrate
the power of rational therapy,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
that understanding things, can you
imagine trying to do this by hit or

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000

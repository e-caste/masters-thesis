00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:30.490
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: I know we've
had a very exciting morning so

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.910
far.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.993
We've been talking about
the accounts payable case

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:34.660
study at Rockwell Collins.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.970
Our next module
on A3 thinking is

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.610
going to take that setting of
the case study that we used,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.438
and we'll launch an A3 planning
exercise from that scenario.

00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:45.730
Before we do that, I just
want to give you a little bit

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.320
of background on A3 as a tool.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.050
So in this module,
we expect you to be

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.220
able to do two
things at the end.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.780
First is to recognize
that A3 is not just a tool

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.820
but really is a way
of thinking, a way

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.043
of trying to solve a problem
in a very structured way.

00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:03.460
And secondly, we want you to
gain a little bit of practice

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.940
with using the tool of an
A3 chart as a standard tool

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.840
for implementing lean projects.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.340
All right.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.650
So first of all,
A3 is really a tool

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.760
for enabling our whole
PDSA or PDCA cycle.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.390
And this is a snapshot
of one particular version

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.210
of an A3 tool up in the corner.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.840
So as we said in the
goals for our module here,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.460
A3 is not just a tool, but
it is also a way of thinking.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.400
It originally evolved as a
management process from Toyota.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
And it's named for the
A3 size sheet of paper,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.210
which is roughly 11 by 17.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.232
And it was chosen as the form
for this particular exercise,

00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:47.440
because it is the largest
piece of paper that can fit

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.660
through a fax machine in Japan.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.400
So you could contain
all the information

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.275
you needed on that one
page, and it was still

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.302
easily translatable
to anywhere else,

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:57.010
because you could put
it in a fax machine

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.010
and someone at the other
end would get it and be

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.630
able to see the whole
description of your problem

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.220
and your courses
of action presented

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.510
on that one piece of paper.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.090
So here is in more
detail an example

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.120
of an A3 sheet that was
developed at Toyota.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.370
You can see on
your tables we have

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.070
some starts of an A3 sheet
for the Rockwell Collins case

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.570
study.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.700
And they're also
blown up here very

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.300
largely on the butcher paper
that's around the room.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.430
And they're broken down
into several sections.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.980
And I just want to spend
the next couple of slides

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.355
walking you through the
basic purpose of an A3

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:33.730
and the different
sections of it.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.190
And I really have to
thank Susan for giving us

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.113
this great introduction to
A3 as a tool in her talk

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:40.030
that happened earlier.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.830
And she showed you
some excellent examples

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.410
of what these actually look
like when they're created.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.710
So first, at the top you
want to start with a title.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.310
What is it that
you're talking about?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.600
What is the focus of your
problem investigation?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.250
Then there's some
background on why

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.860
you're talking about it and
the particular business context

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.780
for the problem
you're examining.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.660
Then more detail on
the current situation.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.540
And you saw in
Susan's representation

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.570
some great pictures
and diagrams.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.280
Pictures can be worth
a thousand words.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.140
They're very helpful
in communicating that.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.280
Sometimes a picture and some
couple of phrases of text

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.110
may be all that you need.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.942
Then there's some
analysis usually done,

00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:17.650
trying to get at,
really, what's the root

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.750
cause of the problem
you're seeing,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.700
requirements, constraints,
or alternatives

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.863
that have to be considered.

00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:25.030
And then lastly down here,
although it's sliding off

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.900
the page, is the goal.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.840
So what's the specific
change that you

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.510
want to accomplish now?

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.060
So this is called the
left-hand side of the A3.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.280
And then over here on
the right-hand side

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.870
starts up with your
recommendations.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.390
So what's your proposed
countermeasures

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.560
to remedy the root causes that
you've identified over here

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.180
and get to your goal?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.240
Then a plan for how
you're going to implement

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.850
those recommendations, and
who's going to do what and when,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.982
and then some follow-up.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.940
So how will you know if
the actions that you're

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.160
planning really have the impact
that you expected they do?

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.630
And this not only lets you know
that your actions have been

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.150
successful, but it also
confirms that your understanding

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.470
of the problem was right.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.990
Because of what you thought
was going to happen happened,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.520
that's a good
reinforcement for it.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.310
All right.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.519
So we just want to stress again
that the thought process used

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.160
in A3 thinking-- thinking
about the context,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.589
analyzing the problem,
figuring out root causes,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.160
setting a goal, thinking about
your steps to then remedy it--

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.590
it really is a thought
process, it's not just a tool.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.600
And sometimes you hear
people talking about A3,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.080
and sometimes it feels like
they get lost in the tool

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.210
and they've somewhat
forgotten about the process.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.910
Another important
attribute of this,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.890
it really is collaborative.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.020
Everybody should get
around an A3 sheet.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.270
It's small enough so you
can all see what's going on,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.020
and it lets people who are
all part of the solutions

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.740
get together to figure out
how to solve the problem.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.920
It promotes very logical
and objective thinking.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.740
We stress having
data on your A3 sheet

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.490
in your description of the
situation and in the analysis.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.160
It lets you think about
the results and the process

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
that you might take to try to
meet some of your objectives.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.340
It forces you to be synthetic
about the problem you're

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.440
thinking about, because you only
have one A3 page to write it

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.940
on.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.273
So you've got to be able to
understand your problem well

00:05:16.273 --> 00:05:18.920
enough, distill it well
enough, that you can convey it

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.850
in a nice, contained space.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.820
It forces alignment between
the context of the situation,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.160
the problems you're seeing,
the root causes of those,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.720
the goals that you
want to achieve,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.095
and the actions
that you're going

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.420
to take to make that happen.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.950
Those all have to be aligned.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.100
And you can see that
in the A3 sheet.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.890
Then as a result, you have
some coherence, both within

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.860
and consistency across all
these elements in your A3 sheet.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.010
And it really makes sure that
you take a systems perspective

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.100
on the problem to get
out of those silos.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.260
So just a little
bit more information

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.060
about each section of the A3.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.520
So we'll start with what's
typically on the left-hand

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.240
side--

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.080
the background, the current
situation, analysis, and goals.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.720
Diagrams are very
useful and efficient

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.210
for communicating in
small spaces like that.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.500
And on Susan's examples of
A3, you saw a lot of diagrams.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.950
Value stream maps were shown up
in the current situation, which

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.000
showed the items of interest,
the process flow between them.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.970
It showed you some data on
that, and then identified

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.350
those cloudbursts of areas
where there were problems.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.550
So some useful questions to ask
as you start to put together

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.350
the left side of the sheet.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.860
Are the activities clearly
specified with regards

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.890
to the content, in order,
and intended outcomes

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.280
as you work through the current
situation analysis and goals?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.680
And are the connections
between all the entities

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.170
that are involved in
your A3 problem very

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.410
clear and explicit?

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.860
So now, moving over to the
right-hand side of the A3

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.700
sheet--

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.168
thinking about
recommendations and plans.

00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:57.960
When you're thinking
about recommendations,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.043
you really want to make
sure that they're directly

00:07:00.043 --> 00:07:01.330
addressing the root cause.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.630
So there has to be
consistency between that part

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.340
of your A3 sheet and
where you describe

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.860
the root causes taking place.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.250
And they really should help
you evolve your process

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.930
from the current state
towards something

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.600
that you see as an ideal
state by eliminating

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.130
some of the root causes.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.778
And then in the
plan section, that's

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:20.820
where you're going to
define the steps to correct

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.960
each of the root causes--

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.140
so, again, traceability and
connectivity, back to that.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.760
And in the process
of doing so, you

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.270
have to identify who exactly is
responsible for what, and when,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.800
and exactly what it is
that they're going to do.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.710
And then the last
part of the A3 sheet

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.940
is really the continuous
improvement part of it.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.040
This is your
follow-up activities.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.600
So how do you know that what
you wanted to happen, happened?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.240
And make sure that when you're
thinking about what you're

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.130
going to look at in
the follow-up section,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.070
that links back to your
original goals for this,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.190
and the criteria and metrics
that you set up for that.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.970
So we have an example
here in the module.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.213
Susan has already teed up
a lot of great examples.

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:03.630
And you're going to be going
through one in your exercise.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.050
So I don't think I
want to spend much time

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.560
on this particular example.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.210
This happens to be from Acme
stamping steering bracket value

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.330
stream improvement exercise.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.210
And just to show you the breadth
of situations across which

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.120
A3 thinking can apply,
you see one here

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.560
for manufacturing process.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.050
We saw lots for health
care from Susan.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.810
And now we're going to go
and do one in the office area

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.110
and accounts payable.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.220
So really, there's no limit
to the context in which you

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.049
can apply A3 thinking,
because it's really

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.409
all about structured
problem solving.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.600
What I will note before
leaving this example

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.570
is the prevalence of the
visual types of information.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.260
So they have their current
state map, a future state

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.630
map on here, a Gantt
chart that they

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.805
have used to describe
their plan, which

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:51.680
are all the deliverables
that have to happen,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.050
and who is going to do them,
who's responsible for them,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.040
and when.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.440
So you can see how these
visual representations

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.430
pack a lot of information
into a nice, tight space.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.900
Further examples-- we
may have come across this

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.160
in our New Balance video.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.390
I can't recall exactly.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.510
But when you go into the
New Balance plant for sure,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.093
you see these--

00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:14.510
they're actually
whiteboard-sized,

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.560
so a little bit large.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.230
So you can actually have people
with markers writing on them.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.640
This is an A3 chart.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.170
And it's up around
the factory floor.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.880
So that's an incredibly powerful
boundary-spanning object.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.590
And all the workers
in a cell can

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.630
get together around
their A3 board

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.612
and strategize about
problem solving.

00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:34.070
And here's an
example where they've

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.680
written up in this section
their root cause analysis.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.860
And they chose to do a
five whys to get down

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.540
to their root cause.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.715
And it's just wonderful to
see this being used right

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:45.590
on the factory floor.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.510
And it's quite
powerful to have that

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.400
there right in
front of the station

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.950
where everybody is
doing their work.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.070
So it's not kept by somebody
else in a desk drawer

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:53.570
somewhere.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.820
It's just up front and visual.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.980
All right.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.100
So now let's move into our
exercise for this module, which

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.390
is taking the Rockwell Collins
accounts payable case study.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:10.730
And we're going to use that
to create an A3 sheet on what

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.040
we should do to try to
solve some of the problems

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.840
that Rockwell is encountering.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.840
So on your table, you'll each
have a small size of these

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.910
so you can refer to it.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.250
And then each of the
groups has a larger version

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.740
up on the easel charts.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.860
So each of the tables is going
to be working with a group.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.230
And you're going to
develop an A3 plan which

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.650
responds to question 8
in the case study, which

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.350
is, "Suppose you are
the RPI team leader

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.930
and have to report
back to Joanie.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.380
What will you recommend?"

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.960
So we'd like you to spend
about 20 minutes preparing

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.690
with your team at
the table an A3 plan.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:47.200
All right.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.908
And we've given you
the template that you

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:50.300
can use to fill that out.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.720
So first, we have to remember
what the constraints are.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.160
I'll detail those
in the next slide.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.480
You should also consider what
Rockwell Collins groups should

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.770
participate in this rapid
process improvement team.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.890
So make sure you think
about all stakeholders.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.350
Then you'll want to verify
that the information we've

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.440
provided to you on
those sheets is correct.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.060
Complete the
additional information

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.640
blocks that are in the template.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.490
And you can use some of the
Post-It notes on the large A3

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.430
to draft the different
elements that you want.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.460
And then you can record
your final recommendations

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.930
on the large A3 sheet.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.790
And at the end of
the class, we'll

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.030
have some table tours where
you can walk around and see

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.070
what your different
colleague teams have

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.360
produced for their plans.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.940
And then we'll have a discussion
and compare and contrast

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.240
some of the strategies that you
thought about in this context.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.660
So just very briefly, the
management constraints

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.620
as we pulled from the
case study are these.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.300
So remember, your main objective
is to reduce cycle time,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.370
going for a goal of
invoice resolution in less

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.110
than 10 days.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.760
But shorter than
that is even better.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.540
Management wants to establish
a training program for everyone

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.020
that's affected by the change.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.020
They'd like to formalize
communication requirements

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.140
for invoice payments
with suppliers.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.640
Changes have to be accomplished
within the current system.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.720
So there's no purchasing new
IT systems to actually solve

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.770
the problem.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.860
And also, to use already
available in-house software

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.100
or IT technology.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.880
Those sort of go hand in hand.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.090
Any action items that might
be addressed in your A3 plan

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.010
have to be completed
within 30 days.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.410
And there can't be
any additional staff.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.240
So an outcome of
your A3 can't be,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.860
"let's hire five new people."

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.940
That wouldn't be acceptable.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.440
All right.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.440
So I'm going to leave the
management constraints

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.353
up here on the projector
so you can see them

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:42.770
as you're working through your
problem solving activities.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.870
And we'll ask each
table to get started.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.120
We'll have the instructors
in the class walking around

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.750
to answer questions and help
you through the process.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.370
So take about 20--

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.570
yeah, 20 minutes.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.168
So I'll give you a 3-minute
warning when we get

00:12:57.168 --> 00:12:58.460
to the end of that time period.

00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:02.810
PROFESSOR: Could
someone suggest what

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.770
might be one of
the things you're

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.810
going to have to do to
implement these recommendations?

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.628
Just one thing.

00:13:06.628 --> 00:13:07.670
AUDIENCE: Cross-training.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.920
PROFESSOR: Cross-training, OK.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.455
Let's just take
cross-training, OK?

00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:12.580
So you're going to have
some kind of recommendation

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.720
on training.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.870
How's that going to--
who's going to do that?

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.790
When's it going to get done
in the sequence of things?

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.620
I find a useful way
to think about this

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.120
is that maybe think
of each of you

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.580
as one of the stakeholders
in the organization.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.270
Maybe you're the mailroom
guy, and Celeste, maybe you're

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.363
the accounts payable person.

00:13:31.363 --> 00:13:32.780
And think about
what would be done

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.590
in your area to implement this.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.010
Maybe you're a vendor.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.640
So you've got to
change your mind now.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.470
Don't go back and redo
the whole problem.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.965
We spent all morning doing that.

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:43.590
Think about, we've
got to implement it.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.173
And you've got to
come back to Joanie.

00:13:45.173 --> 00:13:46.330
And [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.330
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: Yes.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.406
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:53.600
So focus on this task.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.565
AUDIENCE: This is
change billing address.

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:56.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.326
And the next thing we
need to do is we need to--

00:13:58.326 --> 00:13:59.326
AUDIENCE: Who does that?

00:13:59.326 --> 00:13:59.730
Who does that?

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:00.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.000
AUDIENCE: Who does it?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.770
AUDIENCE: Who changes
the billing address?

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.030
AUDIENCE: Purchasing.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.325
Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:05.325 --> 00:14:06.200
AUDIENCE: Purchasing.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:07.890
Purchasing, yep.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.640
AUDIENCE: Simply from
the sheer magnitude,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.540
I would say to get the five
Xs on the end of the invoices

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.820
on the outside of
the company would

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.920
reduce a massive amount of
letters coming in, number one.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.810
And while that's
being done, it allows

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.100
us to train some of the people
inside the company to implement

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.440
the next few steps.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:39.910
AUDIENCE: So use local
companies for faster turnaround.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.008
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.390
AUDIENCE: They just do--
they just throw out the Xs.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.230
We got that.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.520
AUDIENCE: The call center
needs to be trained.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.030
AUDIENCE: In what?

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.090
AUDIENCE: How to use--

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.340
AUDIENCE: IT has to be aware--

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.726
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.788
AUDIENCE: IT needs to-- yeah.

00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:57.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.630
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: All right.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.213
So what we'd like
to do at this point,

00:15:00.213 --> 00:15:02.170
recognizing that not
all the implementation

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.120
plans are finished
and that's OK,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.700
is we'd like to go around
the room around the tables

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.340
and have you share with us where
you are in your implementation

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.100
plan and what you've
come up with so far.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.300
Try to limit your summary
for us to 60 seconds or less.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.550
I'm going to ask to start
with the table in the front,

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.444
and we'll go around the room.

00:15:21.444 --> 00:15:23.348
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:25.420
So thinking about the
three different decisions,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.506
we have purchasing, the
mailroom, and accounts payable.

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:31.740
So the one who will be
doing the training, probably

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.090
the senior management, talk to
the main leaders in each group.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.210
And we want to train
at the same time,

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.630
because [INAUDIBLE] scheduling
issues have the purchasing

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.500
group trainers
have to add the Xs.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.340
But now we're going to train
them to recognize the Xs.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:52.310
And then they have to be able to
train them in document imaging.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.720
And then after the simpler
steps, and then in the future,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.640
create a call center
within the mailroom

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.050
to train the staff [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.768
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Very good, thank you.

00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:05.310
So let's go around
to the next group.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.370
And you can tell us
what you thought about.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.320
AUDIENCE: We focused on the
implementation of the labeling

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.000
of--

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.190
the first one we had five
Xs to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.552
of our invoices.

00:16:16.552 --> 00:16:18.010
And the way we're
going to do this,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.790
we're going to have
a small meeting where

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.370
we have a representative
from the mailroom,

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.220
and a representative
from purchasing,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.530
as well as one of us who
came up with all these ideas,

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.040
sit down together and
decide what the format needs

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.580
to be of this addition.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.745
It could be that some suppliers'
names or some, whatever

00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.370
in the address block,
would be too big,

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.537
and you would never actually
see the Xs because they

00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:44.512
would move off--

00:16:44.512 --> 00:16:45.970
the little window
in the envelopes.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.560
So we just have to decide what
exactly the format, the best

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.860
lettering would be to add on.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.990
Five Xs may not be the best.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.520
Once we know what we want
to put on, we pick one

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.070
of our medium-sized suppliers--

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.320
we picked Ben & Jerry's
for obvious reasons--

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.220
and set up a meeting with them.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.810
Again, we would have
a purchasing rep,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.560
we'd have the mailroom
rep there, but also

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.069
the supplier rep to hopefully
bring the ice cream.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.190
And then we would talk to--

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.829
just talk them through
the whole process

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.060
and just make them aware
of the whole situation.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.609
They don't really
have to do anything

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.823
if we have purchasing
implement the whole solution.

00:17:25.823 --> 00:17:27.740
But they need to be aware
[INAUDIBLE] are also

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.385
the random letters
on the orders.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.760
Actually, I never
mentioned this.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.790
We were thinking about
purchasing when the order gets

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.040
sent initially, that
purchasing actually,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.660
when they type in the order,
that they would add the tag as

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.100
opposed to the supplier.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.392
They would add the tag and
then the supplier would just

00:17:47.392 --> 00:17:50.410
see the letters, wouldn't
have to add them.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.160
And then just watch
how well it goes.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.330
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: OK.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.050
All right.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.520
Let's go around
to the next table.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:04.450
AUDIENCE: So we tried to
introduce a vendor pilot for--

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.610
using a vendor pilot
for our suppliers,

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.400
so add a XXX and a PFR.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.790
We started with a pilot model,
maybe one or two suppliers,

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.000
and then scale up if,
depending on the success,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.230
or introduce some little
modifications as need be,

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.810
before we expand for the PFR.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.480
And then much of our--

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.120
we talked about the IT
work on the scanners.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.680
And then we'd also have to train
staff on the document imaging,

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.010
so be able to use the scanners.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.290
And then we also
talked about training.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.070
But the Lotus Notes, we realized
that that was the point where

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:47.140
when one staff member is away,
others cannot do her function,

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.760
his/her function,
take her place.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.220
So we thought of
training our analysts

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.190
to be able to use the Lotus
Notes so that even when

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.810
one person is away,
other people can

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.090
fill in the space and work--

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.870
could go on that way.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.839
So that's what we came up with.

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:02.922
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: Great.

00:19:02.922 --> 00:19:04.210
Thank you.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.787
So all very three
different ideas.

00:19:05.787 --> 00:19:06.370
This is great.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.402
Go ahead, next table.

00:19:07.402 --> 00:19:08.860
AUDIENCE: We spent
most of the time

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.370
talking about the process
of scanning documents

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.430
into the system, and
who would be doing it.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.670
We talked about whether
we could have a rotating

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.325
analyst, in which case--

00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:23.230
because they would
have knowledge

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:29.950
of what the different needs are,
or whether we would do someone

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.660
from purchasing or
from [INAUDIBLE],,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.040
and probably having
a meeting to talk

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.730
about that within the group
would be the best way.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.750
And then when you would have to
train people to use the Lotus

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.560
Notes, and also
doing the scanner,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.490
and the outcome would be that
all the documents are scanned,

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.410
and you would have some
cross-training ability

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.710
so that, kind of as
mentioned previously,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:03.230
if one person's out, you still
would have the work done.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.610
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: OK.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.260
Last table.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.660
AUDIENCE: We talked a
lot about the process

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.150
of putting the tags
onto the addresses

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.685
and used a similar idea to
that table of the pilot.

00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:17.310
We wanted to start
with like one person

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.727
from purchasing, and training
them and adding to the tags.

00:20:19.727 --> 00:20:22.352
And [INAUDIBLE] local company or
a couple of local companies to

00:20:22.352 --> 00:20:24.080
add it to, just so
that we could be sure

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.390
that we actually got the
invoices before the end

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.250
of our 30-day period.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.020
And then also, train
all the mailroom

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.185
on that first day
about what to expect,

00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:34.310
because they'd start seeing
those Xs [INAUDIBLE] we

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.790
can't guarantee that one versus
another person would see them.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.920
And then we also talked a bit
about what the analysts had

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.840
to do regarding
what exactly they

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.910
need to know to no
longer check for PFRs,

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.700
because that's going
to be a bit tough--

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.990
it's not very clear-cut time
when those will stop coming in.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.990
Also, we discussed how
to find the new images

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.566
after the document is scanned,
instead of on the microfilm.

00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:02.996
So that was the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:05.772
Anything else I'm missing?

00:21:05.772 --> 00:21:06.730
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: OK.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.210
Excellent.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.220
Well, these are all very good
starts to the implementation

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:09.900
plan.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.650
It's fascinating to
see the different ways

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.233
that your groups approached them
and which aspects you thought

00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:16.870
you wanted to start on, as well
as level of details that some

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.190
of your groups thought about.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.650
A lot of great transition
issues are raised

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:26.395
and how you implement
lean kinds of new programs

00:21:26.395 --> 00:21:27.520
that you're thinking about.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.050
So this group talked
about training.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.633
A number of you
talked about training,

00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:32.050
the importance of that.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.570
And if you don't
provide training,

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.330
efforts can fail
before you even begin.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.480
And this group talked
about some staged rollout,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.760
as did other groups.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.600
So let's do pilots--

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.058
test a little bit,
see if it works.

00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:45.433
And then if it
does work, then we

00:21:45.433 --> 00:21:47.740
can deploy it on a larger
scale, and if it doesn't we

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.370
will find that and test a little
bit more before we get success

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.240
and then go out.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.290
Also an excellent attribute
of trying to implement

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.380
a big change like that.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.410
What really happened
in Rockwell Collins?

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.630
Are you curious?

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:03.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:03.750
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: Right.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.530
OK.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.540
So they implemented
the recommendations.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.600
And it didn't work.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.980
They weren't seeing any change
in their performance metrics.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.870
What do you think was happening?

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.470
Any guesses?

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.595
I don't expect you to know.

00:22:19.595 --> 00:22:22.690
I don't expect you to
have a right guess, but.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.107
AUDIENCE: Too much
change at once?

00:22:24.107 --> 00:22:25.607
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Too much change?

00:22:25.607 --> 00:22:26.470
Yeah, what else?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.960
AUDIENCE: They just didn't
understand what was going on.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.735
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
They didn't know--

00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:30.250
that's pretty much accurate.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.810
So what happened was
the analyst said,

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.010
oh, you've got a new system?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.032
Well, I don't like
this new system.

00:22:36.032 --> 00:22:37.240
I don't know this new system.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.160
I'm not going to
follow this new system.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.590
And they started calling all
their contacts and saying,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.450
look, you know, they've
implemented this new system,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.290
but forget about it.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.832
If you have a problem, just
give me a call directly.

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:48.790
And they just totally
subverted all the systems

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.970
that were put in place, largely
because they didn't understand

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.920
that the document
imaging and Lotus Notes

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.723
was going to be useful for them.

00:22:55.723 --> 00:22:56.890
So Rockwell said, all right.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.140
You know what, we'll just--
we'll back away from this,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.640
and we'll do this sort of in
a staged deployment method.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.420
So they just got the
analysts trained up

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.850
and comfortable on the document
imaging to see that was useful.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.460
And then when that
happened, then they

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.130
went to their pooled
queue calling center

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.430
and then initiated that.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.150
So it took a little while,
but they eventually got it.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.940
But the implementation
was challenging because

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.240
of these issues that very
perceptively were raised

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.910
just about, human nature
and organizational natures

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.190
when we come into
big change problems.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.830
Yes.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.310
AUDIENCE: So how does the
culture of organization

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.000
play a role in implementation
of recommendations?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.682
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: It
plays a huge role, right?

00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:38.140
I mean, we've kind
of been alluding

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.800
to this over the course
the last couple of days.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.410
And some cultures and
the way that they operate

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.330
are going to be more
amenable to change--

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.663
that may be part of their
culture-- and accepting of it.

00:23:48.663 --> 00:23:50.890
And others are not going
to accept change so much.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.320
And you have to really
recognize which one you're in so

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.510
that you can approach
any kind of change effort

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.540
in a way that's going to make
sense to the organization

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.045
that you're in and be
productive as a result.

00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:03.670
But it's a really
big topic, and longer

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.010
than we have time to address
in a quick question here.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.670
But we can talk about
it during the break.

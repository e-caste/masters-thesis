00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.150
Let's examine the
velocities of objects

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.260
in the center of
mass reference frame.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.240
So we have object
1 and object 2.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.790
And we have CM.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.070
And we have r1 prime.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.920
And we have r2 prime.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
And recall that we found that
the position vector, r1 prime,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.880
was equal to the
reduced mass over mu

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.050
m1 times the relative
position to r1, 2.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
I'll draw that up here,
r1, 2 from 2 to 1.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
And just to remind
you, r1 minus r2.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.440
And likewise the
position vector r2 prime

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.210
is minus mu m2 over r1, 2.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.940
Well, now we can
differentiate the positions

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.650
in the center of mass frame.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.780
And we find that
the V1, which is,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.350
of course, the derivative
of the position,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.420
is just mu over m1 V1, 2.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.450
And V2 prime is equal to mu
over m2 with a minus sign V1, 2.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.730
Now the significance
of this result

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.850
is that the velocity
of the object

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.070
in the center of mass frame is
equal to some constant times

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.440
the relative velocity.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.430
Likewise, velocity V2 prime
in the center of mass frame

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.730
is also proportional
to a constant.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.770
And it's in minus the
relative velocities.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.039
So the significance
of this result

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.020
is that when we looked at
an elastic one-dimensional

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
collision, we already
have the result

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.060
that the relative
velocities, V1, 2 initial,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.800
is minus the final
relative velocity.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.770
And we also know
from what we saw

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.390
that the relative velocity is
independent of the reference

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.110
frame.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.389
So this condition
about relative velocity

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.340
is true in any reference frame.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.760
And in particular, it's true
in the center of mass frame.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.920
So what that shows us is
that these conditions,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.070
this statement, is
that the magnitude

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.770
of the relative
velocity is constant.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.710
And the conclusion is because
in the center of mass frame,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.560
V1 prime is proportional
to the relative velocity.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.910
That tells us that in a
center of mass reference frame

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.079
that the initial
velocity of object

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:59.160
1 in the center of mass frame
is equal to the final velocity

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.960
of object 1.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.930
So the quantity, the speed
of objects 1 and objects 2

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.680
in an elastic collision in the
center of mass reference frame

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.870
do not change magnitude.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.690
We can call this
quantity V2 prime

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.350
and likewise V
prime 2 initial is

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.360
equal to V2 final
prime V2 prime.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.660
And this will make our
analysis of collisions

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.320
in the center of mass
reference frame very easy.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.300
Two objects, when
they're colliding

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.090
in the center of
mass reference frame,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.870
their speeds do not change.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.090
Only the direction of
their velocities change.

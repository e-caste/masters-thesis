00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.970
PROFESSOR: Now, a theorem that
was quite powerful and applied

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.060
to complex vector
spaces for old V longing

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.560
to V complex vector space.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.340
This implied that the
operator was zero,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.010
and it's not true for
real vector spaces.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.620
And we gave a proof that
made it clear that indeed,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.970
a proof wouldn't work
for a real vector space.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.489
I will ask you in the homework
to do something that presumably

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.020
would be the first thing
you would do if you had

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.800
to try to understand why this
is true-- take two by two

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.420
matrices, and just see why
it has to be 0 in one case,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.410
and it doesn't have to
be 0 in the other case.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.140
And I think that will
give you a better

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.210
perspective on why this happens.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.700
And then once you do
it for a two by two,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.600
and you see how it works, you
can do it for n by n matrices,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.250
and it will be clear as well.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.220
So we'll use this theorem.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.320
Our immediate application
of this theorem

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.150
was a well-known result
that we could prove now

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.680
rigorously-- that t is
equal to t dagger, which

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.200
is to say the operator
is equal to the adjoined.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.740
And I think I will call
this-- and in the notes

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.570
you will see always the
adjoint, as opposed to Hermitian

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.780
congregate.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.789
And I will say
whenever the operator

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.860
is equal to the adjoint,
that it is Hermitian.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.150
So a Hermitian operator
is equivalent to saying

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:29.480
that v Tv is a real number
for all v. And we proved that.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.450
In other words, physically,
Hermitian operators

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.320
have real expectation values.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.420
This is an expectation value,
because-- as you remember

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.480
in the bracket
notation-- v Tv, you

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.230
can write it v T
v-- the same thing.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.480
So it is an expectation value,
so it's an important thing,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.890
because we usually deal
with Hermitian operators,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.240
and we want expectation
values of Hermitian operators

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.770
to be real.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.770
Now that we're talking
about Hermitian operators,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.360
I delay a complete discussion
of diagonalization,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.170
and diagonalization
of several operators

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.440
simultaneously, for
the next lecture.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.600
Today, I want to move forward
a bit and do some other things.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.310
And this way we spread out
a little more the math,

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.070
and we can begin to look
more at physical issues,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.720
and how they apply here.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.750
But at any rate, we're
just here already,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200
and we can prove two
basic things that

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.010
are the kinds of things
that an 805 student should

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.630
be able to prove at any time.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.960
They're really very simple.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.020
And it's a kind of proof that is
very short-- couple of lines--

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.760
something you should be able
to reproduce at any time.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.070
So the first theorem
says the eigenvalues

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.600
of Hermitian operators-- H
is for Hermitian-- are real.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.080
And I will do a little bit of
notation, in which I will start

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.030
with an expression, and
evaluate it sort of to the left

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.130
and to the right.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.820
So when you have an
equation, you start here,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.380
and you start evaluating there.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.270
So I will start with
this-- consider v Tv.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.040
And I will box it
as being the origin,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.830
and I will start evaluating it.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:12.230
Now if v is an eigenvector--
so let v be an eigenvector so

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.530
that Tv is equal to lambda v.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.830
And now we say consider
that expression in the box.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.590
And you try to evaluate it.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.600
So one way to evaluate it--
I evaluate it to the left,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.320
and then evaluate to the right.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.830
Is the naive evaluation--
t on v is lambda v,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.940
so substitute it there.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.690
v, lambda v-- we know it.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.740
And then by homogeneity,
this lambda goes out,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.230
and therefore it's lambda v v.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.730
On the other hand, we have
that we can go to the right.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.970
And what is the way you move an
operator to the first position?

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.580
By putting a dagger.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.480
That's a definition.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.610
So this is by definition.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.190
Now, we use that the
operator is Hermitian.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:26.700
So this is equal to Tv v.
And this is by T Hermitian.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.960
Then you can apply again the
equation of the eigenvalues,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:39.220
so this is lambda v v. And
by conjugate homogeneity

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.760
of the first input,
this is lambda star v v.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.550
So at the end of
the day, you have

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.300
something on the extreme
left, and something

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.405
on the extreme right.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.230
v-- if there is
an eigenvector, v

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.810
can be assumed to be non-zero.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.250
The way we are saying
things in a sense,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.340
0-- we also think of
it as an eigenvector,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.700
but it's a trivial one.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.690
But the fact that
there's an eigenvalue

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.570
means there's a non-zero v
that solves this equation.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.000
So we're using that non-zero
v. And therefore, this

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.670
is a number that is non-zero.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.510
You bring one to the
other side, and you

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:35.640
have lambda minus lambda
star times v v equals 0.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.490
This is different from 0.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.480
This is different from 0.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.340
And therefore, lambda
is equal to lambda star.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:57.170
So it's a classic proof--
relatively straightforward.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.190
The second theorem is
as simple to prove.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.300
And it's already interesting.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.660
And it states that different
eigenvectors of a Hermitian

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.490
operator-- well,
different eigenvalues

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.380
of Hermitian
operators correspond

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.630
to orthogonal eigenfunctions,
or eigenvectors.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:35.140
So different eigenvalues
of Hermitian ops correspond

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:43.080
to orthogonal eigenfunctions--
eigenvectors, I'm sorry.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.080
So what are we saying here?

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.340
We're saying that
suppose you have a v1

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.480
that [INAUDIBLE] T
gives you a lambda1 v1.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.160
That's one eigenvalue.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.110
You have another one-- v2
is equal to lambda 2 v2,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.430
and lambda 1 is
different from lambda 2.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.990
Now, just focusing on a fact
that is going to show up later,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.630
is going to make
life interesting,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.460
is that some
eigenvalues may have

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.180
a multiplicity of eigenvectors.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.190
In other words, If a
vector v is an eigenvector,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.530
minus v is an eigenvector,
square root of three v

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.240
is an eigenvector, but that's
a one-dimensional subspace.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.180
But sometimes for
a given eigenvalue,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.510
there may be a
higher dimensional

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.850
subspace of eigenvectors.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.970
That's a problem of degeneracy,
and it's very interesting--

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.840
makes life really interesting
in quantum mechanics.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.800
So if you have degeneracy,
and that set of eigenvectors

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.950
form a subspace, and
you can choose a basis,

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.850
and you could have
several vectors here.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.630
Now what do you do in that case?

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.880
The theorem doesn't say much,
so it means choose any one.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.790
If you had the bases
there, choose any one.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.490
The fact remains that if these
two eigenvalues are different,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.900
then you will be able to show
that the eigenvectors are

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.220
orthogonal.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:39.530
So if you have some
space of eigenvectors--

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.320
a [INAUDIBLE] higher-dimensional
space of eigenvectors,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.700
one eigenvalue, and another
space with another--

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.420
any vector here is orthogonal
to any vector there.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.055
So how do you show this?

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.150
How do you show this property?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:01.420
Well you have to
involve v1 and v2,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.950
so you're never going to
be using the property that

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.950
gives Hermitian, unless
you have an inner product.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.240
So if you don't have any
idea how to prove that,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.810
you presumably at
some stage realize

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.720
that you probably have
to use an inner product.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.760
And we should mix
the vectors, so maybe

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.100
a V2 inner product with this.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.295
So we'll take a v2
inner product with T v1.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.260
And this is interesting,
because we can use it,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:44.960
that T v1 is lambda 1 v1 to
show that this is just lambda 1

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.495
v2 v1.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.900
And that already brings
all kinds of good things.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.110
You're interested in
this inner product.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.420
You want to show it's
0, so it shows up.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.640
So it's a good idea.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.440
So we have evaluated
this, and now you

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.700
have to think of evaluating
it in a different way.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.040
Again, the operator
is Hermitian,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.120
so it's asking you to
move it to the other side

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.200
and exploit to that.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.810
So we'll move it to the
other side a little quicker

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.430
this time.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.720
It goes as T dagger, but
T dagger is equal to T,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.380
because it's Hermitian.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.230
So this is the center
of the equation.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.140
We go one way.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.880
We go the other
way-- this time down.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:37.100
So we'll put T v2 v1, and
this is equal to lambda--

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:45.520
let me go a little slow
here-- lambda 2 v2 v1.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.930
Your impulse should be it
goes out as lambda 2 star,

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.980
but the eigenvalues
are already real,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:05.210
so it goes out as
lambda 2 v2 v1,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.640
because the operator
is Hermitian.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.440
So at this moment, you
have these two equations.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.800
You bring, say, this
to the right-hand side,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:23.670
and you get lambda 1 minus
lambda 2 v1 v2 is equal to 0.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.780
And since the eigenvalues
are supposed to be different,

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:33.810
you conclude that v1 inner
product with v2 is 0.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.405
So that's the end of the proof.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.160
And those are the
two properties that

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:56.660
are very quickly proven
with rather little effort.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:02.240
So where do we go from now?

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.750
Well there's one more
class of operators

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.320
that are crucial in the physics.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.280
They are perhaps as important
as the Hermitian operators,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.070
if not more.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:20.350
They are some operators that
are called unitary operators,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.580
and the way I will
introduce them

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:35.130
is as follows-- so I will
say-- it's an economical way

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.523
to introduce them-- so we'll
talk about unitary operators.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:54.210
If S is unitary,
and mathematicians

00:14:54.210 --> 00:15:07.180
call it anisometry-- if you find
that S acting on any vector--

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.940
if you take the norm,
it's equal to the norm

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.820
of the vector for all
u in the vector space.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:32.600
So let's follow this, and
make a couple of comments.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.740
An example-- a trivial
example-- this operator lambda

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.560
times the identity.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.770
Lambda times the
identity acts on vectors.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.810
What does it do,
lambda times identity?

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.040
The identity does
nothing on the vector,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.800
and lambda stretches it.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:00.170
So lambda, in order not to
change the length of any vector

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.240
should be kind of 1.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:09.100
Well, in fact, it
suffices-- it's unitary--

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.430
if the absolute value
of lambda is equal to 1.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.400
Because then lambda is a phase,
and it just rotates the vector.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.110
Or in other words, you
know that the norm of av

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:28.630
is equal to the absolute
value of a times

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.550
the norm of v, where
this is a number.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.480
And remember these two
norms are different.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.210
This is the norm of a vector.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:44.210
This is the normal
of a complex number.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:51.090
And therefore, if
you take lambda i u--

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:58.260
norm-- is lambda u is equal
absolute value of lambda u,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.400
and absolute value of lambda
is equal to 1 is the answer.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.599
So that's a simple unitary
operator, but an important one.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:15.180
Another observation--
what are the vectors

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.670
annihilated by this operator u?

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.540
Zero-- it's the only vector,
because any other vector that's

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.570
nonzero has some length,
so it's not killed.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.510
So it kills only zero.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:42.790
So the null space of S
is equal to the 0 vector.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:48.480
So this operator has no
kernel, nothing nontrivial

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.820
is put to zero.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.740
It's an invertible operator.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.870
So s is invertible.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.680
So that's a few things
that you get very cheaply.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.980
Now from this
equation, S u equals

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.270
u-- if you square
that equation, you

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:21.060
would have S u S
u is equal to u u.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.700
Maybe I should
probably call it v.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.890
I don't know why I called
it u, but let's stick to u.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.980
Now, remember that
we can move operators

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.690
from one side to the other.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.970
So I'll move this
one to that side.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.580
If you move an S here,
you would put an S dagger.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:46.290
But since the dagger
of an S dagger is S,

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.860
you can move also the S
to that side as S dagger.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:56.920
So u S dagger, S
u-- you see that.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.940
If you want to
move this one, you

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.130
can move it by putting another
dagger, and you get that one.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:07.910
And this is u u,
and therefore you

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:16.810
get u S dagger, S minus
the identity acting on u

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.210
is equal to 0 for all u.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.500
So for every vector, this is
true, because this is true.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.200
We just squared it.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.100
And now you have our
favorite theorem,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.020
that says if this is true
in a complex vector space,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.830
this is 0, and
therefore, you've shown

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.035
that S dagger S is equal to 1.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.050
So that's another property
of unitary operators.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.830
In fact that's the way
it's many times defined.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.360
Unitary operators
sometimes are said

00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.590
to be operators whose
inverse is S dagger.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.710
I will not go into
the subtleties

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.270
of what steps in all
these things I'm saying

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.260
are true or not true
for infinite dimensional

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.340
operators-- infinite
dimensional vector spaces.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.070
So I will assume, and it
will be true in our examples,

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.170
that if S dagger is an
inverse from the left,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.880
it's also an inverse
from the right.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.420
And perhaps everything is true
for infinite dimensional vector

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.240
spaces, but I'm
not 100% positive.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:50.580
So S dagger is the
inverse of S. And that's

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.920
a pretty important thing.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:04.160
So one last comment on unitary
operators has to do with basis.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:13.980
So suppose you have an
orthonormal basis, e1 up to en.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.015
Now you can define
another basis.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.550
fi equal-- I'll
change to a letter

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:39.910
U-- U e i where U
is unitary, so it's

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:45.720
like the S. In fact,
most books in physics

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.450
call it U for unitary.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.210
So maybe I should have changed
that letter in there, too,

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.340
as well.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.190
So suppose you change basis.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:02.580
You put-- oh, there
was something else

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.930
I wanted to say before.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.170
Thanks to this
equation, consider now

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:14.830
the following thing-- S U Sv.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.040
SUSv-- you can move
this S, for example,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:30.370
to the other side--
S dagger S U v,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.160
and S dagger S is equal
to 1, and it's Uv.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.770
So this is a pretty
nice property.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.030
We started from the
fact that it preserved

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.200
the norm of a single
vector, of all vectors,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.670
and now you see that in fact,
it preserved the inner product.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.160
So if you have two vectors, to
compare their inner product,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.700
compute them after action with
U or before action with U,

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.620
and it doesn't
make a difference.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.670
So suppose you define
a second basis here.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.630
You have one orthonormal basis.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.980
You define basis
vectors like this.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:21.660
Then the claim is that the
f1 up to fn is orthonormal.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.480
And for that you simply do
the following-- you just

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:36.840
check f i f j is
equal to U e i, U e j.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.540
By this property, you can
delete both U's, rules,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.550
and therefore this is e i, e j.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.800
And that's delta i j.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.920
So the new basis is orthonormal.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.480
If you play with
these things, it's

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:06.460
easy to get some extra
curious fact here.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:15.150
Let's think of the matrix
representation of the operator

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:24.310
U. Well, we know
how these things

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.770
are, and let's think of
this in the basis e basis.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:37.480
So U k i is equal to ek U e i.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.300
That's the definition
of U in the basis

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:58.160
e-- the matrix elements of
U. You can try to figure out

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.320
what is Uki in the f basis.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.106
How does operator U
look in the f basis?

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.320
Well, let's just do
it without thinking.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.720
So in the f basis,
I would put fk U fi.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:30.750
Well, but fk is U ek,
so I'll put Uek Ufi.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:44.000
Now we can delete both
U's, and it's ek fi.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.930
And I can remember what
fi was, which is ek U ei.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.700
And it's just the same
as the one we had there.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.790
So the operator,
unitary operator,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.456
looks the same in both bases.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.690
That might seem strange or
a coincidence, but it's not.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.200
So I leave it to
you to think about,

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.570
and visualize why
did that happen.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.740
What's the reason?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:30.000
So the bracket notation-- we've
been using it here and there--

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.650
and I will ask you to
please read the notes.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.410
The notes will be
posted this afternoon,

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.180
and they will have-- not
maybe all we've done today,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.360
but they will have some
of what we'll do today,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.190
and all of what
we've been doing.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.900
And the way it's
done-- it's first

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.800
done in this sort of
inner product language,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.790
and then things are done
in the bracket language.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.210
And it's a little
repetitious, and I'm

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.630
trying to take out some
things here and there,

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.250
so it's less repetitious.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.260
But at this moment it's
probably worth reading it,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.600
and reading it again.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.748
Yes.

00:27:08.748 --> 00:27:13.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if you
have two orthonormal bases,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.370
is the transformation between
them necessarily unitary?

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.597
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:23.850
All right.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.590
So as I was saying we're going
to go into the Dirac notation

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.090
again.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.160
And here's an example of a
place where everybody, I think,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.940
tends to use Dirac notation.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.060
And the reason is
a little curious,

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:44.553
and you will appreciate
it quite fast.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.050
So this will be
the case of where

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:57.273
we return to x and p operators,
on a non-denumerable basis.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.830
So we're going to
try to do x and p.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.730
now this is the classic
of Dirac notation.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.890
It's probably-- as
I said-- the place

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.370
where everybody likes
to use Dirac notation.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.750
And the reason it's efficient
is because it prevents you

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.850
from confusing two things.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:32.340
So I've written in
the notes, and we

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.150
have all these v's that
belong to the vector space.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.580
And then we put
this, and we still

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.150
say it belongs to
the vector space.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:46.310
And this is just a decoration
that doesn't do much.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.050
And we can play with this.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.660
Now, in the
non-denumerable basis,

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.490
the catch-- and the
possible confusion--

00:28:53.490 --> 00:29:02.030
is that the label is not quite
a vector in the vector space.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:06.490
So that is the reason why
the notation is helpful,

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:11.300
because it helps you
distinguish two things that you

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.150
could confuse.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.580
So here we go.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.080
We're going to talk
about coordinate x,

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.260
and the x operator,
and the states.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.500
Well, this is a state space.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.360
So what kind of states
do we have here?

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.625
Well, we've talked
about wave functions,

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:34.250
and we could give
the value of the wave

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.430
function of different places.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.560
We're going to go for a
more intrinsic definition.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.525
We're going to try to
introduce position states.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:56.060
And position states
will be called this-- x.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.060
Now, what is the meaning
of this position state?

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:15.490
We should think of this
intuitively as a particle at x.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.760
Now here's how you can
go wrong with this thing,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.860
if you stop thinking
for a second.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.330
What is, then, ax?

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:48.250
Is it ax, a being a number.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.140
Is it the same thing?

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.630
No, not at all.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:58.930
This is a particle
at the coordinate ax,

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:04.530
and this is a particle at x with
some different amplitude-- very

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.260
different.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.500
So this is not true--
typical mistake.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:14.770
This is not minus x.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.450
That's totally different.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.595
So there's no such
thing as this, either.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.310
It doesn't mean anything.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:34.990
And the reason is that these
things are not our vectors.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:40.670
Our vector is this whole thing
that says a particle at x.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:45.250
Maybe to make a
clearer impression,

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.310
imagine you're in
three dimensions,

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.210
and you have an x vector.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.965
So then you have to ket this.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:01.370
This is the ket particle at x.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:02.930
x is now a vector.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.320
It's a three-dimensional vector.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.270
This is a vector,
but it's a vector

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.910
in an infinite
dimensional space,

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.480
because the particle
can be anywhere.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.990
So this is a vector
in quantum mechanics.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.090
This is a complex vector space.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:25.880
This is a real vector space,
and it's the label here.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:33.730
So again, minus x is
not minus x vector.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.575
It's not the vector.

00:32:35.575 --> 00:32:41.060
The addition of the bra
has moved you from vectors

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.720
that you're familiar
with, to states

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.830
that are a little more abstract.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.990
So the reason this notation is
quite good is because this is

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.490
the number, but this i---
or this is a coordinate,

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.090
and this is a vector already.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.572
So these are going to
be our basis states,

00:33:02.572 --> 00:33:03.780
and they are non-denumerable.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.260
And here you can
have that all x must

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.390
belong to the real numbers,
because we have particles

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:22.270
in a line, while this thing
can be changed by real numbers.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.982
The states can be multiplied
by complex numbers,

00:33:24.982 --> 00:33:26.565
because we're doing
quantum mechanics.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:33.260
So if you want to define
a vector space-- now,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.990
this is all infinite dimension.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.730
It's a little
worse in this sense

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.150
the basis is non-denumerable.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:43.800
If I use this basis, I cannot
make a list of all the basis

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.540
vectors.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.930
So for an inner product, we
will take the following--

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:58.220
we will take x with y to
be delta of x minus y.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.090
That will be our inner product.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:06.550
And it has all the properties
of the inner product

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.250
that we may want.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:13.449
And what else?

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:18.370
Well at this moment,
we can try to-- this

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.800
is physically
sensible, let me say,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.830
because if you have a
particle at one point

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.159
and a particle at another
point, the amplitude

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:31.440
that this particle at one point
is at this other point is 0.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.710
And these states are
not normalizable.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.880
They correspond to a
particle at the point,

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.710
so once you try to normalize
them, you get infinity,

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.000
and you can't do much.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.179
But what you can do here is
state more of the properties,

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:46.860
and learn how to
manipulate this.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:57.590
So remember we had one was
the sum of all e i e i.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.890
The unit operator was that.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.490
Well, let's try to
write a similar one.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:09.505
The unit operator will
be the sum over all x's.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.640
And you could say,
well, looks reasonable,

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.210
but maybe there's a 1/2
in here, or some factor.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.260
Well, no factor is needed.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:30.240
You can check that-- that you've
defined this thing properly.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.650
So let me do it.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:39.010
So act to on this
so-called resolution

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:48.060
of the identity with the vector
y, so 1 on y is equal to y.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.777
And now let's add
on the right xxy.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.670
This is delta of x minus y.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.300
And then when you
integrate, you get y.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.750
So we're fine.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.120
So this looks a
little too abstract,

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.520
but it's not the abstract if you
now introduce wave functions.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.830
So let's do wave functions.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:26.930
So you have a particle, a
state of the particle psi.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.790
Time would be random, so I will
put just this psi like that

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.690
without the bottom line.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.350
And let's look at it.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.343
Oh, I want to say
one more thing.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:52.500
The x operator acts on
the x states to give x x.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.400
So these are eigenstates
of the x operator.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400
We declare them
to be eigenstates

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.680
of the x operator
with eigenvalue x.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.330
That's their physical
interpretation.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:08.430
I probably should
have said before.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:15.030
Now, if we have a psi as a
state or a vector, how do

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.530
we get the wave function?

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.860
Well, in this language
the wave function,

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.260
which we call psi
of x, is defined

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.365
to be the overlap of x with psi.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:37.810
And that makes sense,
because this overlap

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:42.420
is a function of this label
here, where the particle is.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.310
And therefore, the result
is a complex number

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.200
that is dependent on x.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.590
So this belongs to
the complex numbers,

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.480
because inner products
can have complex numbers.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.040
Now, I didn't put any
complex number here,

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.200
but when you form states,
you can superpose states

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.610
with complex numbers.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:07.060
So this psi of x will
come out this way.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:11.110
And now that you
are armed with that,

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.440
you can even think of
this in a nicer way.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.290
The state psi is
equal to 1 times psi.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.740
And then use the
rest of this formula,

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:30.940
so this is integral--
dx x x psi.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.460
And again, the bracket
notation is quite nice,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.360
because the bra
already meets the ket.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:43.875
This is a number, and
this is dx x psi of x.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.760
This equation has a
nice interpretation.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:55.980
It says that the state is a
superposition of the basis

00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.130
states, the position
states, and the component

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.690
of your original state
along the basis state

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:08.170
x is precisely the value
of the wave function at x.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.270
So the wave function
at x is giving you

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:14.370
the weight of the state x
as it enters into the sum.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:23.620
So one can compute more things.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.750
You will get practice in
this type of computations.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:31.730
There are just a limited type
of variations that you can do,

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:37.120
so it's not that complicated.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.180
Basically, you can introduce
resolutions of the identity

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.710
wherever you need them.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.050
And if you introduce too
many, you waste time,

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.220
but you typically get
the answer anyway.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.970
So it's not too serious.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:56.810
So suppose you
want to understand

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.213
what is the inner
product of two states.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:05.000
Put the resolution of
the identity in between.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:14.300
So put phi, and then put
the integral dx x x psi.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:23.380
Well, the integral goes out,
and you get phi x x psi.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:29.740
And remember, if
x psi is psi of x,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:36.450
phi x is the complex conjugate,
so it's phi star of x.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.240
And you knew that.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.100
If you have two wave
functions, and you

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.700
want to compute the overlap, you
integrate the complex conjugate

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.700
of one against the other.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.235
So this notation is doing
all what you want from this.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.560
You want to compute a
matrix element of x.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:12.920
Well, put another resolution
of the identity here.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:19.740
So this would be integral
dx phi-- the x hat is here.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.960
And then you put x x psi.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.670
The x hat on x is x.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.610
That's what this
operator does, so you

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:46.830
get integral dx of-- I'll
put x phi x x psi, which

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:50.160
is what you expect
it to be-- integral

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.260
of x phi star of x, psi of x.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:06.930
Now we can do exactly the same
thing with momentum states.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.790
So I don't want to
bore you, so I just

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:15.520
list the properties--
basis states are

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.830
momenta where the
momenta is real.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:26.520
p prime p is equal delta
of p minus p prime.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:33.900
One is the integral dp of p p.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.725
And p hat p is equal to p p.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.350
So these are the momentum bases.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.530
They're exactly analogous.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.600
So all what we've
done for x is true.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.440
The completeness
and normalization

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.930
work well together,
like we checked there,

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.610
and everything is true.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:07.830
The only thing that you need
to make this more interesting

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.860
is a relation between the
x basis and the p basis.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.440
And that's where
physics comes in.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.250
Anybody can define these two,
but then a physical assumption

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:27.560
as to what you really mean
by momentum is necessary.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.070
And what we've said is
that the wave function

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:36.091
of a particle with
momentum p is e to the i

00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:42.370
px over h bar over
square root of 2 pi

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:49.280
h-- convenient normalization,
but that was it.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.090
That was our physical
interpretation

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.010
of the wave function of a
particle with some momentum.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.665
And therefore, if this is
a wave function, that's xp.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.650
A state of momentum p
has this wave function.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.400
So we write this.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:21.130
OK, there are tricks you can
do, and please read the notes.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.270
But let's do a
little computation.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:29.930
Suppose you want to
compute what is p on psi.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.350
You could say,
well, I don't know

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.770
why would I want to do
something with that?

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.370
Looks simple enough.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.000
Well, it's simple
enough, but you

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.840
could say I want to see that
in terms of wave functions,

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.660
coordinate space wave functions.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.530
Well, if you want to see them in
terms of coordinate space wave

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.330
functions, you have to introduce
a complete set of states.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:58.430
So introduce p x x psi.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.240
Then you have this
wave function,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.380
and oh, this is sort
of known, because it's

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:10.566
the complex conjugate of
this, so it's integral dx

00:45:10.566 --> 00:45:19.300
px over h bar, square root
of 2 pi h bar times psi of x.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.140
And this was the
Fourier transform--

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.260
what we call the Fourier
transform of the wave function.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:33.840
So we can call it psi tilde
of p, just to distinguish it,

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.320
because we called
psi with x, psi of x.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.190
So if I didn't put
a tilde, you might

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.450
think it's the same
functional form,

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.400
but it's the momentum
space wave function.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:51.180
So here is the wave
function in the p basis.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.690
It's the Fourier
transform of the wave

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.220
function in the x basis.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.020
One last computation, and
then we change subjects again.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:10.360
It's the classic
computation that you

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.530
have now a mixed situation,
in which you have the momentum

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:20.430
operator states and
the coordinate bra.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:34.753
So what is the following
expression-- X p hat psi?

00:46:44.696 --> 00:46:45.195
OK.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.750
What is your temptation?

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:57.170
Your temptation is to say,
look, this is like the momentum

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:02.490
operator acting on the wave
function in the x basis.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:09.790
It can only be h bar
over i d dx of psi of x.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:13.020
That's probably what it means.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.730
But the notation
is clear enough,

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.120
so we can check if that
is exactly what it is.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.360
We can manipulate
things already.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.250
So let's do it.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:28.900
So for that, I first have to
try to get rid of this operator.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.840
Now the only way I know how
to get rid of this operator p

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.090
is because it has eigenstates.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:40.890
So it suggests very strongly
that we should introduce

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.430
momentum states, complete them.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:53.080
So I'll put v p x p hat p p psi.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.770
And now I can
evaluate the little--

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:09.050
because p hat and p is little
p, or p without the hat.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:17.570
So this is p xp p psi.

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:28.990
Now you can look
at that, and think

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.800
carefully what should you do.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.250
And there's one
thing that you can

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:40.200
do is look at the
equation on top.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.100
And this is a way to
avoid working very hard.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.250
So look at the equation on
top-- x p is equal to that.

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:53.240
How do I get a p
to multiply this?

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.390
I can get a p to
multiply this xp

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:06.530
by doing h bar
over i d dx of x p.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:17.790
Because if I see it there, I
see that differentiating by d dx

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:21.160
brings down an ip over h bar.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.760
So if I multiply by h
bar over i, I get that.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.055
So let's do this.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:43.730
Now I claim we can
take the h over i d

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:47.690
dx out of this integral.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:51.380
And the reason is that first,
it's not an x integral.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.440
It's a p integral, and nothing
else except this factor

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.630
depends on x.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.170
So I take it out and I
want to bring it back,

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.970
it will only act on
this, because this is not

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.920
x dependent.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:10.930
So you should think of psi, psi
doesn't have an x dependence.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.050
Psi is a state, and here is p--
doesn't have an x dependence?

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.280
You say no, it
does, it looks here.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.060
No, but it doesn't have it,
because it's been integrated.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.030
It really doesn't
have x dependence.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:27.140
So we can take this out.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:31.490
We'll have h over i d dx.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:37.140
And now we have vp x p p psi.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:44.850
And now by completeness,
this is just 1.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.070
So this becomes x psi.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:55.750
So h bar over i d dx of x psi,
which is what we claimed it

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:56.340
would be.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:06.083
So this is rigorous--
a rigorous derivation.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.260
There's no guessing.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.670
We've introduced
complete states until you

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.490
can see how things act.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.860
But the moral is here
that you shouldn't

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.730
have to go through this
more than once in your life,

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.750
or practice it.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:27.270
But once you see something
like that, you think.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.780
You're using x
representation, and you're

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.040
talking about the operator p.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.140
It cannot be anything like that.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.650
If you want to practice
something different,

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:49.860
show that the analogue p x
hat psi is equal i h bar d dp

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.920
of psi tilde.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.670
So it's the opposite relation.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.550
All right.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.050
Questions?

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.212
Yes.

00:52:05.212 --> 00:52:09.256
AUDIENCE: So how's one supposed
to-- so what it appears

00:52:09.256 --> 00:52:11.755
is happening is you're basically
taking some state like psi,

00:52:11.755 --> 00:52:15.486
and you're basically writing
in terms of some basis.

00:52:15.486 --> 00:52:18.430
And then you're basically using
the [INAUDIBLE] coordinates

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.470
of this thing.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.780
But the question is, what does
this basis actually look like?

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:27.100
Like, what do these vectors--
because if you put them

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.400
in their own coordinates,
they're just infinite.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.430
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.290
AUDIENCE: They're not
even delta-- I mean--

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:33.790
PROFESSOR: They are
delta functions.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:34.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.980
PROFESSOR: These vectors
are delta functions

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:43.720
because if you have a state
that has this as the position

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.550
state of a particle,
you find the wave

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.580
function by doing x on it.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.120
That's our definition
of a wave function.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.670
And its infinite.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:59.150
So there's is not too much
one can say about this.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:02.830
If people want to work
more mathematically,

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:05.155
the more comfortable
way, what you do

00:53:05.155 --> 00:53:07.950
is, instead of taking
infinite things,

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.540
you put everything
on a big circle.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.220
And then you have
a Fourier series

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:18.400
and they transform as sums,
and everything goes into sums.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.210
But there's no real need.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:22.510
These operations are safe.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:27.920
And we managed to do them,
and we're OK with them.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.150
Other questions?

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:31.334
Yes.

00:53:31.334 --> 00:53:32.209
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:38.926 --> 00:53:39.925
PROFESSOR: Probably not.

00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:45.000
You know, infinite
bases are delicate.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.510
Hilbert spaces are infinite
dimensional vector spaces,

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.670
and they-- not every
infinite dimensional space

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.550
is a Hilbert space.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:57.930
The most important
thing of a Hilbert space

00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:00.840
is this norm, this
inner product.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.980
But the other important thing
is some convergence facts

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.170
about sequences of
vectors that converge

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.220
to points that are on the space.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.900
So it's delicate.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.880
Infinite dimensional
spaces can be pretty bad.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.550
A Banach space is
not a Hilbert space.

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:20.190
It's more com--

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.640
PROFESSOR: Only
for Hilbert spaces,

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:31.505
and basically, this problem
of a particle in a line,

00:54:31.505 --> 00:54:35.630
or a particle in three space
is sufficiently well known

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:40.410
that we're totally
comfortable with this somewhat

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.100
singular operation.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:46.110
So the operator x
or the operator p

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.960
may not be what
mathematicians like them

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.950
to be-- bounded operators
in Hilbert spaces.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:56.260
But we know how not to
make mistakes with them.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.230
And if you have a very
subtle problem, one day

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.950
you probably have
to be more careful.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.740
But for the problems we're
interested in now, we don't.

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:15.270
So our last topic today is
uncertainties and uncertainty

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.040
relations.

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.095
I probably won't get through all
of it, but we'll get started.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.750
And so we'll have uncertainties.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.850
And we will talk
about operators,

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:46.760
and Hermitian operators.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.560
So here is the
question, basically--

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.550
if you have a state,
we know the result

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:57.380
of a measurement
of an observable

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:02.090
is the eigenvalue of
a Hermitian operator.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:06.730
Now, if the state is an
eigenstate of the Hermitian

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.100
operator, you measure
the observable,

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.860
and out comes eigenvalue.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:17.290
And there's no uncertainty
in the measured observable,

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.000
because the measured
observable is an eigenvalue

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.420
and its state is an eigenstate.

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.480
The problem arises when
the state that you're

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.600
trying to measure
this property is not

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.240
an eigenstate of the observable.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.510
So you know that the
interpretation of quantum

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.040
mechanics is a
probabilistic distribution.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.610
You sometimes get one thing,
sometimes get another thing,

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.280
depending on the
amplitudes of the states

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.500
to be in those
particular eigenstates.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.450
But there's an uncertainty.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:54.420
At this time, you
don't know what

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.690
the measured value will be.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:01.620
So we'll define the uncertainty
associated to a Hermitian

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.855
operator, and we want to
define this uncertainty.

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:08.000
So A will be a
Hermitian operator.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.400
And you were talking
about the uncertainty.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.812
Now the uncertainty
of that operator--

00:57:22.812 --> 00:57:24.770
the first thing that you
should remember is you

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:26.870
can't talk about the
uncertainty of the operator

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.500
unless you give me a state.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.370
So all the formulas we're going
to write for uncertainties

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:36.790
are uncertainties of
operators in some state.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:39.635
So let's call the state psi.

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:50.510
And time will not be
relevant, so maybe I

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:56.890
should delete the-- well,
I'll leave that bar there,

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.470
just in case.

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:04.300
So we're going to try
to define uncertainty.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.970
But before we do that,
let's try to define

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:11.350
another thing-- the
expectation value.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.240
Well, the expectation
value-- you know it.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.740
The expectation value of A,
and you could put a psi here

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:24.600
if you wish, to remind you that
it depends on the state-- is,

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:29.080
well, psi A psi.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.520
That's what we call
expectation value.

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.710
In the inner product
notation would be psi A psi.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:48.570
And one thing you know--
that this thing is real,

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:55.490
because the expectation values
of Hermitian operators is real.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:58.280
That's something we reviewed
at the beginning of the lecture

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.080
today.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:06.070
So now comes the
question, what can I

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:10.240
do to define an
uncertainty of an operator?

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.120
And an uncertainty-- now
we've said already something.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.970
I wish to define an
uncertainty that is such

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:25.310
that the uncertainty is 0 if
the state is an eigenstate,

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.720
and the uncertainty
is different from 0

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.910
if it's not an eigenstate.

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:33.850
In fact, I wish that
the uncertainty is 0 if

00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:38.130
and only if the state
is an eigenstate.

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:41.700
So actually, we
can achieve that.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:50.140
And in some sense, I think,
the most intuitive definition

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:55.670
is the one that
I will show here.

00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.080
It's that we define the
uncertainty, delta A,

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.950
and I'll put the psi here.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:10.060
So this is called
the uncertainty of A

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.285
in the state psi.

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.390
So we'll define it a simple way.

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:20.720
What else do we want?

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.010
We said this should
be 0 if and only

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:28.490
if the state is an eigenstate.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:32.900
Second, I want this thing
to be a real number--

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.790
in fact, a positive number.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:40.990
What function do we know
in quantum mechanics

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.000
that can do that magic?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.940
Well, it's the norm.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.610
The norm function is
always real and positive.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:52.860
So this-- we'll try to
set it equal to a norm.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:01:00.870
So it's the norm of the
state A minus the expectation

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:08.240
value of A times
1 acting on psi.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.170
This will be our definition
of the uncertainty.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.233
So it's the norm of this vector.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.700
Now let's look at this.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:32.730
Suppose the norm
uncertainty is 0.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:40.180
And if the uncertainty is
0, this vector must be 0.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:49.960
So A minus expectation
value of A on psi is 0.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:02:00.330
Or A psi is equal to
expectation value of A on psi.

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:02.090
The 1 doesn't do much.

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.460
Many people don't write the 1.

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.030
I could get tired
and stop writing it.

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:13.630
You should-- probably it's
good manners to write the i,

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:16.910
but it's not all that necessary.

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:18.500
You don't get that confused.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.970
If there's an operator
and a number here,

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:24.310
it must be an identity matrix.

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:28.880
So the uncertainty is 0, the
vector is 0, then this is true.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.200
Now, you say, well, this
equation looks kind of funny,

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.270
but it says that psi
is an eigenstate of A,

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.230
because this is a number.

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.300
It looks a little
funny, because we're

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.580
accustomed to A psi lambda
psi, but this is a number.

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.410
And in fact, let me
show you one thing.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:57.320
If you have A psi equal
lambda psi-- oh, I

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.426
should say here that
psi is normalized.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:08.010
If psi would not be normalized,
you change the normalization.

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:10.765
You change the uncertainty.

01:03:10.765 --> 01:03:11.890
So it should be normalized.

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:19.980
And look at this-- if you
have a psi equal lambda psi,

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:27.130
do the inner product with psi.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:33.510
Psi comma A psi would
be equal to lambda,

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.810
because psi inner
product with psi is 1.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.310
But what is this?

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:41.730
This is the
expectation value of A.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.010
So actually, given
our definition,

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:50.750
the eigenvalue of some
operator on this state

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:53.720
is the expectation value of
the operator in the state.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.910
So back to the argument--
if the uncertainty is 0,

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:01.000
the state is an eigenstate.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.130
And the eigenvalue happens to
be the expectation value-- that

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:07.480
is, if the uncertainty is 0.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.220
On the other hand, if you are
in an eigenstate, you're here.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.180
Then lambda is A,
and this equation

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.470
shows that this vector is
0, and therefore you get 0.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:25.860
So you've shown that this norm
or this uncertainty is 0, if

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.820
and only if the state
is an eigenstate.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.550
And that's a very
powerful statement.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:36.130
The statement that's
always known by everybody

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:40.480
is that if you have
an eigenstate-- yes--

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.450
no uncertainty.

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:45.700
But if there's no uncertainty,
you must have an eigenstate.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.360
That's the second
part, and uses the fact

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.420
that the only vector with 0 norm
is the zero vector-- a thing

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.490
that we use over and over again.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:05:00.930
So let me make a
couple more comments

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.430
on how you compute this.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:09.525
So that's the
uncertainty so far.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.970
So the uncertainty
vanishes in that case.

01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:24.420
Now, we can square this
equation to find a formula that

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:30.130
is perhaps more familiar--
not necessarily more useful,

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.440
but also good.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.500
For computations, it's
pretty good-- delta A

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.180
of psi, which is
real-- we square it.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:42.100
Well, the norm square
is the inner product

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:58.560
of this A minus A
psi A minus A psi.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.090
Norm squared is the inner
product of these two vectors.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.800
Now, the thing
that we like to do

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.420
is to move this
factor to that side.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.650
How do you move a factor on the
first input to the other input?

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:16.600
You take the adjoint.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.660
So I should move
it with an adjoint.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.370
So what do I get?

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:31.210
Psi, and then I get the
adjoint and this factor again.

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:44.320
Now, I should put a dagger
here, but let me not put it,

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.990
because A is Hermitian.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:53.800
And moreover, expectation
value of A is real.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.140
Remember-- so no
need for the dagger,

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.920
so you can put the
dagger, and then

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.290
explain that this is
Hermitian and this is real--

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:05.910
or just not put it.

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:08.700
And now look at this.

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.580
This is a typical calculation.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.255
You'll do it many, many times.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:18.440
You just spread out the things.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.800
So let me just do it once.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.360
Here you get A squared minus
A expectation value of A minus

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.960
expectation value of
A A plus expectation

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.135
value of A squared psi.

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:44.850
So I multiplied everything,
but you shouldn't be all

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:49.820
that-- I should put
a 1 here, probably--

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.450
shouldn't worry about this much.

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.850
This is just a number and
an A, a number and an A.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.010
The order doesn't matter.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:59.120
These two terms are
really the same.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.520
Well, let me go
slowly on this once.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.020
What is the first term?

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.770
It's psi A squared psi, so
it's the expectation value

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.870
of A squared.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:15.260
Now, what is this term?

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.960
Well, you have a number
here, which is real.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.220
It goes out of whatever you're
doing, and you have psi A psi.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.090
So this is expectation
value of A.

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:28.590
And from the leftover
psi A psi, you

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:36.640
get another expectation
value of A. So this is A A.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.430
Here the same thing--
the number goes out,

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:42.220
and you're left with
a psi A psi, which

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:49.010
is another expectation value
of A, so you get minus A A.

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:53.430
And you have a plus
expectation value of A squared.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.890
And I don't need the i anymore,
because the expectation values

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.490
have been taken.

01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:00.689
And this always happens.

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:03.920
It's a minus here, a
minus here, and a plus

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.964
here, so there's just one
minus at the end of the day.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:21.529
One minus at the end of the
day, and a familiar, or famous

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:31.779
formula comes out that
delta of A on psi squared

01:09:31.779 --> 01:09:36.250
is equal to the expectation
value of A squared minus

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:41.420
expectation value of A squared.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:44.430
Which shows something
quite powerful.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:48.120
This has connections, of course,
with statistical mechanics

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.193
and standard deviations.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.390
It's a probabilistic
interpretation of this formula,

01:09:56.390 --> 01:10:00.940
but one fact that this
has allowed us to prove

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.050
is that the expectation
value of A squared

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:06.550
is always greater
or equal than that,

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:10.380
because this number is
positive, because it

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.670
is the square of a
real positive number.

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:17.610
So that's a slightly
non-trivial thing,

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:19.256
and it's good to know it.

01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:26.380
And this formula, of
course, is very well known.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:36.030
Now, I'm going to leave a funny
geometrical interpretation

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:37.020
of the uncertainty.

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:40.110
Maybe you will find
it illuminating,

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.580
in some ways turning
into pictures

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.460
all these calculations
we've done.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.460
I think it actually
adds value to it,

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:52.680
and I don't think
it's very well known,

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.380
or it's kind of funny, because
it must not be very well known.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:01.630
But maybe people don't
find it that suggestive.

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:04.020
I kind of find it suggestive.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:09.550
So here's what I want
to say geometrically.

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:12.110
You have this vector space,
and you have a vector psi.

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:22.180
Then you come along, and
you add with the operator

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:27.890
A. Now the fact that
this thing is not

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:32.510
and eigenstate means that
after you add with A,

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.500
you don't keep in
the same direction.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.180
You go in different directions.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.670
So here is A psi.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:50.630
So what can we say here?

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:55.700
Well, actually
here is this thing.

01:11:55.700 --> 01:12:00.030
Think of this vector
space spanned by psi.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.850
Let's call it U psi.

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:10.860
So it's that line there.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:16.680
You can project this
in here, orthogonally.

01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:27.030
Here is the first
claim-- the vector

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:30.130
that you get up to
here-- this vector-- is

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:37.210
nothing else but expectation
value of A times psi.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:40.140
And that makes sense, because
it's a number times psi.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.120
But precisely the orthogonal
projection is this.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.850
And here, you get an
orthogonal vector.

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:48.740
We'll call it psi perp.

01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.000
And the funny thing
about this psi perp

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.863
is that its length is
precisely the uncertainty.

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:12.220
So all this, but you could
prove-- I'm going to do it.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.220
I'm going to show you all
these things are true,

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.550
but it gives you a
bit of an insight.

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:17.870
you have a vector.

01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.980
A moves you out.

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:24.524
What is the uncertainty is
this vertical projection--

01:13:24.524 --> 01:13:25.940
vertical thing is
the uncertainty.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:30.560
If you're down there,
you get nothing.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.130
So how do we prove that?

01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:41.440
Well, let's
construct a projector

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:49.440
down to the space U
psi, which is psi psi.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:56.880
This is a projector,
just like any e1.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.660
e1 is a projection into
the direction of 1.

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.450
Well, take your first
basis vector to be psi,

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:07.310
and that's a projection to psi.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:11.950
So let's see what it--
so the projection to psi.

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:15.600
So now let's see
what it gives you

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:24.390
when it acts on A psi--
this project acting on A psi

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:31.120
is equal to psi psi A psi.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.590
And again, the usefulness
of bracket notation

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:38.400
is kind of nice here.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.310
So what is this?

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:44.780
The expectation value of A. So
indeed psi expectation value

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.870
of A is what you get when
you project this down.

01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:05.550
So then, the rest
is sort of simple.

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:13.885
If you take psi, and
subtract from psi-- well,

01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:31.360
I'll subtract from psi, psi
times expectation value of A.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.270
I'm sorry, I was
saying it wrong.

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:41.040
If you think the
original vector-- A psi,

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.520
and subtract from
it what we took out,

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.610
which is psi times expectation
value of A, the projected

01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:53.840
thing-- this is some vector.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:01.880
But the main thing is that this
vector is orthogonal to psi.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.630
Why?

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:09.450
If you take a psi on the left,
this is orthogonal to psi.

01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:10.830
And how do you see it?

01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:13.980
Put the psi from the left.

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.340
And what do you get here?

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:19.180
Psi A psi, which is
expectation value of A,

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:23.840
psi psi, which is 1, and
expectation value A is 0.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:30.110
So this is a vector psi perp.

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:35.280
And this is, of course,
A minus expectation value

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.270
of A acting on the state psi.

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:46.300
Well, precisely the norm of
psi perp is the norm of this,

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.510
but that's what we defined
to be the uncertainty.

01:16:51.830 --> 01:17:04.840
So indeed, the norm of psi
perp is delta A of psi.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.230
So our ideas of projectors
and orthogonal projectors

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.340
allow you to
understand better what

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:14.010
is the uncertainty--
more pictorially.

01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:18.080
You have pictures of vectors,
and orthogonal projections,

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.550
and you want to make
the uncertainty 0,

01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:24.010
you have to push
the A psi into psi.

01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:28.160
You have to be an
eigenstate, and you're there.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:31.430
Now, the last thing of-- I'll
use the last five minutes

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:37.965
to motivate the uncertainty,
the famous uncertainty theorem.

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.470
And typically, the
uncertainly theorem

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:09.460
is useful for A and B--
two Hermitian operators.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:22.250
And it relates the uncertainty
in A on the state psi

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:27.570
to the uncertainty
in B of psi, saying

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:31.535
it must be greater than
or equal than some number.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.600
Now, if you look
at that, and you

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.580
think of all the math
we've been talking about,

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.870
you maybe know
exactly how you're

01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:51.860
supposed to prove the
uncertainty theorem.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.070
Well, what does
this remind you of?

01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:05.750
Cauchy-Schwarz--
Schwarz inequality,

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:08.350
I'm sorry-- not Cauchy-Schwarz.

01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.850
Why?

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:16.870
Because for Schwarz inequality,
you have norm of u, norm of v

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:21.600
is greater than or equal than
the norm of the inner product

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:29.290
of u and v-- absolute value of
the inner product of u and v.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.660
Remember, in this thing,
this is norm of a vector,

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.910
this is norm of a vector, and
this is value of a scalar.

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:42.160
And our uncertainties are norms.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.720
So it better be that.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.640
That inequality is
the only inequality

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.800
that can possibly
give you the answer.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:54.500
So how would you set this up?

01:19:54.500 --> 01:20:04.990
You would say define-- as we'll
say f equal A minus A acting

01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:15.060
on psi, and g is equal to
B minus B acting on psi.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:25.730
And then f f, or f f
is delta A squared.

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:32.806
f g g is delta B squared.

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:42.090
And you just need to compute
the inner product of f g,

01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:44.330
because you need the mixed one.

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:48.420
So if you want to
have fun, try it.

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.380
We'll do it next time anyway.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.600
All right that's it for today.

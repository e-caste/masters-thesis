00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.630
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.410
lecture on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.640
structures.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.460
In this lecture, I'd like to
continue with our discussion

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.450
of inelastic material
descriptions we use in finite

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.050
element analysis.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.850
Particularly, I'd like to now
discuss with you creep, creep

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.990
of materials.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.890
We considered already in the
earlier lecture that a typical

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
creep law used in engineering
practice very widely is the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.990
power creep law, shown here.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.880
Here we plot creep strains as a
function of time, and curves

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.840
that we would typically obtain
using this creep law for

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.010
constant stress values with
time are shown here.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.210
Notice that as, of course, the
stress value increases, which

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.050
however is constant in
time, we obtain a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.830
larger creep value.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.730
Creep strains increase, the
creep strains increase, in

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.670
other words, as the stress
increases clearly shown also

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.800
by this law.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.720
Notice a1 and a2 of course, and
a0 are constants that are

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.110
determined from laboratory
test results.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.340
There are a number of
other creep laws.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.090
Two are listed here.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.140
One here, shown, and another
one shown here.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.550
Notice in this one here, the
temperature, which affects

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.630
creep strains quite heavily,
enters explicitly right here.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.770
In the other creep laws, the
first two ones, the one that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.400
you saw on the earlier view
graph, and this one, these

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.680
constants, of course, a0, a1,
a2, and so on, would depend on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.669
the temperature.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.950
And if the temperature is
constant, you would simply

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.620
select them depending on that
temperature condition, and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.550
model creep strains this way.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.770
However, as I pointed out,
here temperature enters

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.730
explicitly.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.590
We will not discuss these
creep laws further.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.470
The numerical computations with
these creep laws are very

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.210
similar to the numerical
computations that we perform

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.650
when using the power
creep law.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.950
So I will now use the
power creep law as

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.470
an example to discuss.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.440
The creep strain formula, given
here once again, cannot

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.770
directly be applied to varying
stress situations because the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.080
stress history does not enter
directly into the formula.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.210
Let us look at that
much closer.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.190
Here we have a very simplified
example where we start off

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.590
with a certain stress level,
and then that stress level

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.010
drops down to this
stress level.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.910
Notice that if we were to apply
the formula sort of

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.300
"blindly," blindly in quotes, we
would obtain creep strains

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.080
that vary, depending on this
stress level, as shown here.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.900
And then we might say suddenly
the creep strain would drop

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.270
down, and we would carry on
going on this curve here.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.120
To creep curve, creep strain
curve, that corresponds to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.590
this stress level.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.450
Now, this is really quite
unrealistic that suddenly when

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.970
our stresses decrease, the
creep strains decrease.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.970
Creep strains are accumulated
along this curve here and they

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.530
should certainly be staying
right here.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.690
And the ensuing creep strain
should, of course, now depend

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.070
on the curve in which sigma 1
enter, but we should not see

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.270
the sudden decrease
in creep strain.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.960
And we need to introduce the
concept of strain hardening,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.500
the assumption of strain
hardening.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.300
And this says the following.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.380
The material creep behavior
depends only on the current

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.640
stress level and the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.830
accumulated total creep strain.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.590
And we establish the ensuing
creep strain by solving for an

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.300
effective time.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.590
Let's look at that closely.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.050
Here we have that at a
particular time, the creep

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.000
strain is given via
this formula.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.510
Now, if we know the creep strain
corresponding to a

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.830
particular time, then we of
course know the stress as

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.760
well, and we know
these constants.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.690
Then we can solve for what is
called here an effective time.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.350
This effective time is not the
physical time, it's a time

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.210
that is simply used for the
numerical solution.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.840
So we solve for this tbar, and
then knowing this tbar we can

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.720
proceed with the creep
calculations at a different

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.840
stress level.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.840
Let's look how we would
use that tbar.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.400
First, we would enter here.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.620
Now in this equation, knowing
tbar, simply substitute into

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.030
here, in terms of the creep
strain that we are given from

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.270
the previous history,
and we now get a new

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.170
creep strain rate.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.810
This is how we do the
actual computation.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.050
Let's look at what this
means pictorially.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.470
Pictorially, we now look again
at the situation where we have

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.220
a certain stress value, and that
stress value drops down,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.300
say, to here with time.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.970
As long as we are having this
stress, our creep strain

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.780
accumulates as shown here.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.390
As soon as this stress drops
down, we are going over to

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.740
this curve.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.520
So there's no sudden decrease
in creep strain, say down

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.030
here, down to here and then
increase in creep strain, the

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.840
way we looked at it earlier.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.570
Instead we continuously increase
the creep strain.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.560
Let's look at how do we
get this curve here.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.340
Well we talked about the
evaluation of tbar.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.860
tbar is an effective time.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.710
With this creep strain given at
the time that this stress

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.870
value drops down to here, with
this creep strain value given,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.220
we enter into the formula
corresponding to this creep

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.910
strain accumulation and
calculate tbar.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.600
tbar, the effective
time, would be

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.220
this value right here.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:19.610
We use now this formula, shown
by this black line here, to

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.350
calculate the corresponding
increase in creep strain,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.670
corresponding to this
level of stress.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:36.800
This means that if I draw a
little triangle in here, that

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.990
this line here, for example,
is equal to that line.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.420
And this slope, or this
distance here is

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.210
equal to that distance.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.910
In other words, I can mark this
as, say, a and b, and I

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.100
have here a and b as well.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:59.360
So basically, we are translating
this curve here to

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.660
right there.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.190
And that is shown by
these blue arrows.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.060
Notice all of this is achieved
by the evaluation of the

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.740
effective time.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.060
The effective time corresponding
to this creep

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.480
strain, and this effective time
is applied to the creep

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.200
strain accumulation formula
corresponding to this sigma 1

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.350
stress level.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.050
Well the increase in stress
is modeled similarly.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:36.159
Here we have initially stress
sigma 1, and suddenly an

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.090
increase to sigma 2 level.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.470
We would follow this
curve here,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.790
corresponding to sigma 1.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:52.600
And now the increase in stress
is captured by solving for the

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.470
effective time.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.570
Using this level of creep
strain, we enter into the

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:06.390
curve, shown here in black, to
obtain the effective time

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.900
corresponding to this
curve here.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.470
This is the curve, of course,
corresponding to

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.780
this sigma 2 level.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:21.350
And we translate these points
over, as shown by the blue

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.830
arrows, to obtain this material
response curve.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.000
So we are now using the
effective time again to

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.010
evaluate the ensuing creep
strain when we are going from

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.040
sigma 1 stress level to
sigma 2 stress level.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.530
If we have cyclic conditions,
we proceed similarly.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.670
Here, we have first sigma
1, and then as stress

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.610
reverses to sigma 2.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:59.980
Notice sigma 1 brings us along
this curve, and at this

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.310
particular time, we now
reverse the stress.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:10.640
And here we have to be careful
to recognize that this curve

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.420
here, which I'm showing now in
green, corresponds to that

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.360
curve there.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:28.980
In other words, as I proceed
along this curve here, I would

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.680
proceed along that
curve there.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.130
The reversal in stress is picked
up by saying that the

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.380
accumulated creep strain in one
direction corresponding to

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.000
sigma 1 tensile stress is sort
of, say, forgotten, and you

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.360
simply take this curve
here to be the

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.150
reflection of that curve.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.050
So this is the condition or the
modeling of cyclic loading

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.680
conditions as regards
to creep strain.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.350
Of course, these were now the
one dimensional situation, and

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.200
in a multiaxial stress state,
we have to generalize these

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.000
considerations to the multiaxial
conditions.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.330
Let's look at the multiaxial
creep, how we proceed there.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.760
Here we have the stress at time
t plus theta t is equal

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.590
to the stress at time t plus an
integration of the stress

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:35.580
strain law times the elastic
strain here, differential

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.240
elastic strain increment--

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.660
this is the elastic stress
strain law--

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.320
from time t to time
t plus theta t.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.020
If this matrix is constant,
we can, of course, pull it

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.080
outside the integration sign.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:01.720
The stress strain integration
is performed for the

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.200
multiaxial stress state using
the concepts that we discussed

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.140
for the uniaxial stress state
and generalizing them to the

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.360
multiaxial stress state.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.410
We defined for this purpose an
effective stress shown here.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.310
These are deviatoric stresses
that we already encountered in

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.900
the discussion of plasticity.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:32.520
An effective strain, shown here,
and we use now these two

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.500
quantities in this material law,
the power material law.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.710
We only consider now the
situation of stresses

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.320
monotonically increasing
or being constant.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.220
We do not go into depth
regarding cyclic loading

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.980
conditions because we don't
have really time to do so.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.070
The assumption that the creep
strain rate are proportional

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.780
to the current deviatoric
stresses is giving this

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.890
equation, and that equation is
very similar to what we have

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.520
seen in von Mises plasticity
where gamma

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.890
is given down here.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.860
Notice that the effective creep
strain rate is given via

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.700
formula where the effective
time goes in here.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.380
This is the effective time
calculated much the same way

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:29.990
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.820
in the way that I discussed
earlier for the uniaxial

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.280
conditions.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.520
Except that we have to now deal
with the effective stress

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.520
here in the effective
quantities on the

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.030
creep strain as well.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.720
In other words, we calculate
this effective time just the

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.130
same way as we did it in
uniaxial conditions, but

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.210
always using effective stress
and effective strain

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.980
quantities.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.980
Using matrix notation we can
then write that the creep

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.670
strain increment, the
differential creep strain

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.880
increment, is given via
this right-hand side.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.540
D is an operator shown here for
3D analysis that gives us

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.480
the deviatoric stresses from
the actual stresses.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.140
In the analysis of creep
problems we perform a time

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.790
integration, and this time
integration can be difficult

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.680
due to the high exponent
on the stress.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.140
In fact, solution stability
arise if we, for example, use

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.810
the Euler forward integration
with too large a time step.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:33.390
A rule of thumb is given here
where we want to allow only

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.440
that the effective creep strain
increment is smaller,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.700
equal to 1/10 of the
current at time t,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.360
effective elastic strain.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.990
This is a very good rule of
thumb, however, it can be

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.660
conservative.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.850
In some cases, you can really
increase this coefficient

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.090
quite a bit.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.400
Alternatively, we can use
implicit integration in which

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.390
when we use the alpha method,
we use this formula here.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.510
And we would use an implicit
integration typically alpha

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.430
greater equal to 1/2.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:12.620
Alpha can, in this formula,
vary between 0 and 1.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.880
Of course, when alpha is equal
to 0, we simply have the Euler

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.410
forward method.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:23.710
Let's look at how we would use
this formula when alpha is

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.576
greater, equal to 1/2.

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:31.130
We would calculate the stresses
corresponding to the

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.070
i minus first iteration.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.550
And here we have to pause a
minute to remember to recall

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.190
that this i minus first
iteration is the iteration

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.830
that we have been talking about
in earlier lectures when

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:53.230
we iterate for the equilibrium
of R equal F. Or we are

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:59.690
evaluating in each iteration
k times theta U is equal to

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:04.330
theta R, and the theta U carries
the i superscript, and

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.870
the theta R carries the
i minus 1 superscript.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.580
Remember, we talked about the
iteration for nodal point

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.460
equilibrium of external forces
with nodal point forces that

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.500
are corresponding to the
internal element stresses.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.600
That i minus 1 up here refers
to that iteration.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.750
This k down here refers to the
iteration that is an addition

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.760
necessary at each integration
point level due to the fact

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.120
that we use an implicit
scheme.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.310
Well this left-hand side is
calculated by taking the

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.830
stress at time t, which we know
already, and adding to it

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.220
an increment in stress obtained
via the elastic

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.790
material law here.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.200
The total strain increment from
time t to time t plus

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.770
theta t, iteration i minus 1.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.880
This i minus 1 corresponds
to that i minus 1.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.090
We know this value, of course.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:04.970
Minus the creep strain
calculated based on the stress

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.910
at the end of iteration
k minus 1.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.770
That one goes right in here.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.700
It goes in there as well.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.950
And therefore, these are the
creep strains corresponding to

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.640
the end of iteration
k minus 1.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.589
We calculate it right inside and
obtain an updated value of

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.240
stress corresponding
to iteration k.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.420
This is the iteration that has
to be performed at every one

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.120
of the integration points in
the finite element mesh.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.380
Here we show nine-node element
with 3 by 3 integration.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.300
So is the kind of iteration that
has to be performed at

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.510
every one of these integration
point stations.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.190
When alpha is greater or equal
to 1/2, we obtain a stable

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.950
integration algorithm.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.710
This is a statement arrived at
from a linearized stability

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.800
analysis, so in practice
we use frequently

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.190
alpha equal to 1.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.380
Also, to accelerate this
iteration at the integration

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.940
point level, it is frequently
effective to use some form of

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.850
Newton-Raphson iteration.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.670
The choice of the time step
using the implicit integration

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:21.720
scheme is now governed by
two considerations.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.110
The first one, of course, you
want to converge in the

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:31.560
iteration, which had the
iteration counter k minus 1 to

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.310
k you want to converge
in there.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.690
And of course also, even if we
do converge, we want to have

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.260
an accurate integration.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:47.370
Our errors in the integration
should not be too large.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.330
Of course, we can also
use some form of

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.775
subincrementation, the way we
have been discussing it when

00:18:52.775 --> 00:18:56.600
we talked in the last lecture
about plasticity.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.860
If we compare time steps that
are usable, that are

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.250
realistically usable with the
implicit scheme with alpha

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:11.000
greater/equal to 1/2 with the
time step that we are bound to

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.960
use when we use alpha
equal to 0.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.170
Because we need to have a time
step small enough to have

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.630
stability of the integration.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.720
We find that with alpha
greater/equal to 1/2, we can

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.070
use usually, frequently,
much larger time steps.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.500
But not always.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.160
We will see later on in example
where alpha equal 0

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.530
performs just as well as the
scheme of alpha equal to 1/2.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.360
If we deal with thermoplasticity
and creep, we

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.660
have to model the plastic strain
components, and here we

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.350
have schematically shown how
we can model those strain

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.220
components.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.070
Notice for different
temperatures, for different

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.480
temperature levels, we have
different stress strain laws.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.250
In each case, we have assumed
the bilinear assumption.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.400
Notice that the yield stress
drops down as the temperature

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.360
increases, of course.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.870
And with increase in
temperature, our creep curves

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.030
looks this way.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.870
Notice that our creep strain,
of course, increases at a

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.930
given stress when the
temperature increases.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.650
To evaluate the stresses in
thermoplastic and creep

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.010
analysis we use this
equation here.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.030
Notice elastic stress
strain law.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.320
Of course, now changing
with time, with

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.380
temperature that is.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.750
And here we have the elastic
differential strain increment.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.590
Thermal strain also enter
now here as well.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.930
Creep strain, plastic
strain, total

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.910
differential strain increment.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.270
If we use the alpha method,
this integration without

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:07.660
subincrementation, or, say, a
subincrement of 1, going from

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:13.040
t plus theta t in one step, we
would have that this equation

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.570
reduces directly to
that equation.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.940
Notice this is here now
the stress strain law.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.580
At time t plus theta t,
temperature corresponding to

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.280
that time would go in here.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.000
And here we have the total
strain increment from time t

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.250
to t plus theta t.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.920
We subtract the plastic strain
increment over the time

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.190
increment, the creep strain
increment over the time

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.440
increment and thermal
strain increment.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.870
And these are here, the
corresponding quantities,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.130
total strain plastic strain,
creep strain, thermal strain

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.790
corresponding to time t.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:03.100
Notice that ep and ec and e
thermal have to be evaluated

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.500
in this integration, and we
evaluate them as shown here.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.940
Notice here, t plus alpha
theta t sigma goes in.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.700
And if alpha is equal to
greater/equal 1/2, typically

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.410
we would use alpha 1/2
or alpha equals 1.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.430
For an implicit integration, we
need, again, to integrate

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.000
at each integration point
to satisfy the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.950
stress strain equation.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.070
Of course, t alpha is a
coefficient of thermal

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.800
expansion at time t.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.980
Please don't confuse this
value with the alpha

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.910
integration parameter that
we talked about earlier.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.880
The final iterative equation, if
we use alpha greater/equal

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.970
to 1/2 we would find
looks this way.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.650
Stress strain law at time
t plus theta t--

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.210
elastic stress strain
law, I should say--

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.940
goes in here, and on the
right-hand side, we have the

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.990
total strain corresponding
to time t plus theta t,

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.650
iteration i minus 1.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.560
End of iteration i minus 1,
plastic strain, creep strain,

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.110
thermal strain, which are given
corresponding to time t.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:21.540
And we subtract here the plastic
strain increment, the

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.030
creep straining increment, both
based on the stress at

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.200
the end of iteration
k minus 1.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.640
And of course, the thermal
strain increment.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.640
So this is the equation that
we would solve at each

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.030
integration point, at each
integration point in the

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.690
finite element mesh
by iterating until

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:44.920
convergence is reached.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.280
Until, in other words, this
stress here is basically equal

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.290
to that stress.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.550
And as I pointed out earlier,
we really need to use some

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.430
form of Newton-Raphson
iteration in order to

00:23:55.430 --> 00:24:00.620
accelerate this iteration
when theta t is not--

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.130
unless theta t is very,
very small.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.540
Of course, we can also use
subincrementation.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.970
And then the convergence will be
increased because our time

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.190
step over the subincrement
is smaller.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:20.080
But I should also mention, as
I did already earlier, it is

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.290
very effective frequently to
use this new algorithm, the

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.510
effective stress function
algorithm, to solve basically

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.590
this equation.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.540
And please look at the reference
given in the study

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.900
guide if you're interested in
reading up about that method.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.210
Let's look now at some
example solutions.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.970
And the first problem that I'd
like to discuss with you is a

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:45.940
very simple problem of a bar
under a uniaxial stress sigma.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.715
The creep law that we want
to use is given here.

00:24:49.715 --> 00:24:55.980
The stress is method in
megapascal, time in hours, and

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.670
E and nu, the elasticity
constants are given down here.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.190
What we want to do here is to
look at various solutions that

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.430
have been obtained with
alpha equals 0.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.020
We don't use subimplementation.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.140
Alpha equals 1.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.760
The effective stress function
procedure was used here.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.710
In all cases, we assume an MNO
formulation, or we use an MNO

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.910
formulation.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.350
And we use Full-Newton iteration
without line

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.900
searches, with these tolerances,
and we discussed

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.210
the meaning of these tolerances

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.400
in an earlier lecture.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.300
In the response predictions for
which we used the ADINA

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.730
program, of course, you will be
seeing the elastic strain

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.460
plus the creep strain.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.180
Let's first look at the
response when we put a

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:52.180
constant load of 100 MPa onto
the specimen when the creep

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:57.050
material law is shown here, or
with this material creep law.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.550
Notice that displacements are
measured upwards, time

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.600
measured horizontally here.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.300
And the time step that we used
in this particular case was 10

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.910
hours with alpha equal to 1.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:15.880
So this is the total strain
accumulation, but measured in

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.470
terms of displacement.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.250
Of course, the bar is 5 meters
long, so you could directly

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.670
obtain the strain by simply
taking this displacement

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.690
divided by 5.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:33.830
If we increase the stress from
100 MPa to 200 MPa, you obtain

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.510
this response curve for the
displacement at the right end

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.110
of the bar.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:44.080
We use, again, the alpha equals
1 parameter with the

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.510
effective stress function
algorithm, and a

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.520
time step of 10 hours.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.290
In this particular case, we had
a change from 100 MPa to

00:26:54.290 --> 00:27:00.490
200 MPa in the applied stress,
and that is modeled as shown

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:06.690
on this view graph, constant
stress up to time 500 hours.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:12.860
And then the stress increment
taken over 10 hours.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.600
And then the stress is
constant at 200 MPa.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.980
Stress reversal from 100
MPa to minus 100

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.695
MPa gives this response.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.630
Notice we are not crossing
exactly at that point because

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.880
of elastic strains.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:42.450
A constant load of 100 MPa,
but now with a different

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:50.390
exponent on the time for the
creep law gives this response.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.290
Theta t 10 hours, alpha
equals 1 still.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:28:00.250
If we increase the stress from
100 to 200 MPa with this new

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.960
creep law, or new exponent I
should say, you get this

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.330
response for the displacement
at the right end of the bar.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:15.920
And finally, the stress reversal
from 100 to minus 100

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.280
MPa gives this response.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:24.210
Notice we have here, of course,
a or a displacement at

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.910
the end of the bar due to
the elastic effects.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.060
Let's consider now, the use of
alpha equals 0 for the stress

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:41.210
increase from 100 Mpa to 200 MPa
problem, and see how our

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:45.600
alpha equals theta solution
performs when compared to

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.500
alpha equals 1.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.610
You can see that with theta t
equals 10 hours, we get a

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.890
response that is very much the
same of the two responses

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.870
calculated with alpha equals
0, and alpha equals 1/2--

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.710
very close to each other.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.780
If you use a lot of time steps,
theta t equals 50

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:07.710
hours, both algorithms converge,
but the solution

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.680
becomes less accurate with
alpha equals 0 in this

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.890
particular problem, in this
particular problem.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.090
Notice our baseline solution
that we are comparing with

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:24.060
here corresponds to alpha equals
1 and theta t equals

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.690
10, which is a solid line.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.190
When we take and even larger
time step, theta t equals 100

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.940
hours, we find that alpha equals
0 does not converge

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.280
anymore at t equals 600 hours.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.410
Whereas the use of
alpha equals 1

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.295
gives very good results.

00:29:44.295 --> 00:29:48.870
Alpha equals 1 gives these
triangles here, and they lie

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.870
exactly on the response obtained
with alpha equals 1

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.490
theta t equals 10 hours.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.330
So excellent results with alpha
equals 1, even when the

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.710
time step is 10 times larger.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.655
With alpha equals 0, we could
only obtain the response up to

00:30:05.655 --> 00:30:08.310
this point, and then
we did not converge

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.750
anymore in the solution.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.000
This was a very simple
problem, but a

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.350
demonstrative problem.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.950
Let us look at another problem
now, another example, that has

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:26.460
a bit more complexity, and I
think that you also will enjoy

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.360
looking at.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.580
Here we have a column subjected
to a compressive

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.090
load, R, which is not applied
exactly at the center of the

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.755
column, but is applied
with an offset.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.490
We analyzed this column as
a plane stress problem.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.800
The material constant,
elastic material

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.550
constants are given here.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.200
In elastic buckling
load, calculate it

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.100
using analytical formulas.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.870
The Euler buckling load
is given here as 4,100

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.520
kilonewton.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.800
The goal of the analysis is
to determine the collapse

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.640
response using different
material assumptions.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.330
First of all, is using an
elastic material assumption.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.960
Then, assuming
elasto-plasticity, and

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.700
finally, assuming creep
in the material.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.330
We use in each case the total
Lagrangian formulation.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.810
If you were to try to use a
material [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.530
your only formulation for this
problem, of course, you would

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.390
never predict the actual
collapse of the column.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.660
You have to include large
displacement,

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.110
large rotation effect.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.710
All of the assumption of small
strain is quite reasonable

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.300
even for this problem.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.510
The solution procedure that we
use will be the full Newton

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.920
method without line searches.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:52.150
And these are the tolerance
values that we're using, which

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.420
we discussed already in
an earlier lecture.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.920
The mesh used is a 10 eight-node
quadrilateral

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.620
element mesh.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.250
Here you see the eight-node
elements, 10 of them.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.980
We don't show the nodes.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:11.880
But for each of these elements
we use also 3 by 3 Gauss

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.610
integrations.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.870
So notice through the thickness
of the total column,

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:20.600
we would have six integration
point stations.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.350
First we predict the
elastic response.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.200
And in the elastic response
using the total Lagrangian

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.810
formulation, we enter with
this stress strain law.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:33.130
Second Piola-Kirchhoff stresses
are related to the

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.310
greener ground strains via the
elasticity constants, and we

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.450
discussed this stress strain
law quite a bit

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.640
in an earlier lecture.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.840
The response predicted
is shown here.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.550
Applied force in kilonewton,
and here the lateral

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.090
displacement at the
top of the column.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.430
Notice the Euler buckling
load, calculated from

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:01.570
classical analysis, is shown by
the blue line here, and our

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.370
analysis yield this response.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.060
If we perform the elasto-plastic
analysis with a

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.030
strain hardening model
is equal to 0.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.390
In other words, we assume
perfect plasticity, a yield

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.390
stress of 3,000 kilopascal.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.970
And we use it for von Mises
yield criterion.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:30.600
In this formula, we would
predict with this formula

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.640
here, quite adequately,
the large displacement

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.970
elastic-plastic response, and
of course, this will be for

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.230
this column, the large

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.180
displacement collapse response.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.590
Notice that CEP 0 is the
incremental elasto-plastic

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.360
constitutive matrix calculated
the way we discussed it in the

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.660
previous lecture.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.160
But instead of using the
engineering stresses, we enter

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.280
now with the components of the
second Piola-Kirchhoff stress,

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.130
right in there.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.510
The plastic buckling that is
calculated using this approach

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.440
is shown here.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.130
Notice this is the
elasto-plastic response curve,

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.830
applied force, lateral
displacement at

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.465
the top of the column.

00:34:21.465 --> 00:34:24.230
The elastic response curve
is shown here.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.630
Finally, we want to calculate
the creep response.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:34.540
And for this analysis we have
to select a creep law.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.020
This is the creep law
that we selected.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.080
A power creep law with the
exponent up here equal to 1.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.139
On the time, in other words,
exponent from 1.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.150
Notice that we are entering
here, of course, with

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.590
effective quantities, effective
creep strain,

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.969
effective stresses, the way
I discussed it earlier.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.100
We do not include, in this
analysis, plasticity effects.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.430
We apply in this particular
analysis, a load, a constant

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.870
load of 2,000 kilonewton to the
column, and simply watch

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.560
what happens to the column.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:14.870
Due to the creep strains, the
displacement of the column

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.810
will increase, and we want
to measure, calculate the

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.410
increase of the column
displacement.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.680
And we say that the column
has collapsed.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.440
This, of course, is somewhat
arbitrary, but we say that it

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.070
has collapsed when the lateral
displacement at the top of the

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.880
column is 2 meters.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.690
This corresponds, by the way, to
a strain of about 2% at the

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.230
base of the column, and we know
that our total Lagrangian

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.360
formulation is quite applicable
up to that

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.730
percentage range.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:59.400
We want to investigate varying
time steps, and varying alpha.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.690
Alpha equals 0 is the Euler
forward method, and alpha

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.330
equals 0.5, and 1 corresponds,
of course, to an implicit

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.900
integration scheme.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.880
If we do so, we obtain
the collapse times

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.080
given in this table.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.380
using theta t equals 0.5.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.740
With alpha equals
0 we get 100.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.410
With alpha equals 0.5,
we get also 100.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.250
And with alpha equals
1, we get 98.5.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:34.730
So the collapse time predicted
with theta t equals 0.5 is

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:41.220
very close using any one of
these integration schemes.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.940
When the time step gets larger,
the collapse time

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.410
changes for alpha equals
0, for alpha 0.5,

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:51.840
and for alpha 1.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.160
In fact, the difference between
these collapse times

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.390
for theta t equals 0.5 is quite
a bit here, showing that

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:08.810
this time step is a bit large
for this analysis.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:14.110
The column looks this
way pictorially.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:19.370
At time 1 hour, the creep
effects are still negligible.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.380
At time 50 hours, well
there we have some

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.680
creep effects already.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.690
And at 100 hours, collapse
occurs of the column.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.330
In other words, the column
displacement being two meters

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.200
or larger at the top.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.060
In this particular analysis,
we used theta t equals 0.5

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:41.400
hours, and alpha equals 1/2.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.530
If we compare once more the
different responses predicted,

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.460
we find that with theta t equals
0.5 hours, the lateral

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:57.120
displacement as a function of
time predicted using alpha 1,

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:04.130
alpha 0, alpha equals 0.5 as
shown, as given here by these

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.000
curves, and notice these
curves are very

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.440
close to each other.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:14.310
If we use the large time step,
theta t equals 5 hours, we can

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.490
see here that alpha equals 0,
the alpha equals 0 curve is

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:22.620
very close to the alpha
equals 0.5 curve.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.700
Where the alpha equals 1 curve
is quite a bit away.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:33.000
So in this particular case, we
really have a much larger area

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.940
accumulation when we use alpha
equals 1, than we have with

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.830
alpha equals 0.5 or
alpha equals 0.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.170
We conclude then for this
problem that as the time step

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:50.480
is reduced, the collapse times
predicted using alpha equals

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.940
0, alpha 1/2, and alpha
1 are very, very

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.450
close to each other.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.470
In fact, for theta t equals
2.5, the difference in the

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.110
collapse times is less than
two hours using the three

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.780
integration schemes.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.690
And we also notice that for a
reasonable time step, in this

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.890
particular problem, we certainly
did not encounter

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:16.510
any solution instability,
particularly with respect to

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:21.900
the alpha equals 0 integration
method where one might have

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.910
instabilities, as I pointed
out earlier.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.440
For this problem, we did
not encounter any such

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.060
instability.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.230
This concludes then what I
wanted to share with you in

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:33.750
terms of experiences as
documented on the view graph.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.850
I'd like to now share some
further experiences with you

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:41.350
regarding an interesting
analysis that we performed

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:45.860
some time ago regarding a
heat treatment process.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.410
And that analysis is documented
on the slides, so

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:55.390
let me walk over here and
discuss these sides with you.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:59.300
Here we have a cylinder, and
it is this cylinder that is

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:04.160
subjected to heat treatment
process, namely initially the

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.520
cylinder is at 900 degrees
Celsius, and it suddenly

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.330
cooled down to 20
degrees Celsius.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.315
The objective of the analysis
was first of all, to predict

00:40:14.315 --> 00:40:17.950
the temperature distributions in
the cylinder as a function

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.610
of time, as the cylinder
cools down.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.820
And then to predict the
corresponding stresses in the

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.470
cylinder, and most importantly,
to predict the

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:30.720
finer, the residual stresses.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.140
Here, once again,
the cylinder.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.400
Here, the finite
element model.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.210
Notice that we modeled one
typical section through the

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.240
cylinder, and that section
is shown here.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.380
The center line of the cylinder
is here, and we

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.490
perform an axisymmetric
analysis.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.020
Notice that we have a higher
density of elements at the

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.260
outer face or near the outer
face of the cylinder than at

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.030
the inside of the cylinder.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.920
So then now because we are
predicting higher temperature

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:08.180
gradients, stress gradients at
this end, notice that in this

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:13.160
particular analysis, we
constrain the top face to move

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.500
just vertically up to basically

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.200
remain a straight line.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.680
That was achieved using
constraint equations.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.760
Of course, all these
nodes along the top

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.900
face can move over.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.060
The assumption of this top face
to move only vertically

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:40.460
up is due to the fact that the
cylinder will reflect the fact

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.910
that the cylinder is assumed
to be infinitely long.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:52.460
The next slide now shows the
material properties used for

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.990
the temperature analysis.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:58.780
Here we have the heat capacity
as a function of temperature.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.130
And here we have the
conductivity as a function of

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.460
temperature.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.370
This data was entered in the
heat transfer analysis in

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.660
which we wanted to predict
the temperature.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:17.420
These material properties
here, Young's modulus, a

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.530
strain hardening modulus,
Poisson's ratio are entered in

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.400
the stress analysis.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:31.900
Notice the large variation in
Et, Poisson ratio, and E as a

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:37.360
function of time over the range
from 0 degree Celsius to

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.090
900 degrees Celsius.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:45.070
Next we see the variation
of the yield stress as

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.580
a function of time.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.440
Notice very marked variation.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.900
And notice this here is a region
of a face change where

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.425
we have a tremendous drop
in the use stress.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.080
The next slide now shows the
coefficient of thermal

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.610
expansion as a function
of temperature.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.820
Notice that the coefficient is
positive in this regime and

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:16.120
that regime, and is negative
here to take into account the

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.200
face change effects.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.860
On the next slide now we see
the prediction of the

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.610
temperature as calculated.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.160
Notice initially, the
whole cylinder is

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.000
at 900 degrees Celsius.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.310
We measure here the axes along
the axis of the cylinder.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.460
And here, temperature.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:48.260
And as time progresses, the
temperature changes down to 20

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.870
degrees Celsius at
300 seconds.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.360
Let's look a little bit
more closely here.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.800
Notice at point 0.05 seconds,
this here is the temperature

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.906
distribution in the cylinder.

00:44:01.906 --> 00:44:05.210
At 0.5 seconds, this is the
temperature distribution in

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.550
the cylinder.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:10.940
And at 3.5 seconds, we see this
temperature distribution.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:16.510
At 18.5 seconds, we see this
temperature distribution.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:20.640
Notice the last temperature
gradient right here in this

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.360
area, and this is the area where
we had a denser finite

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.820
element mesh.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.020
Then close to the center
line of the cylinder.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.700
The next slide now shows the
temperature as a function of

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:41.110
time, here time, here
temperature

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.290
at a number of locations.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:48.510
First of all, at the axes of the
cylinder, and notice there

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.480
we have a calculated curve,
the solid curve, and a

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.390
measured curve, the
dash curve.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:59.200
They are remarkably close
to each other.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.690
This is here the calculated
temperature at element 14

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.610
within the cylinder.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:11.410
And this is here the surface
temperature , calculated

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.520
because there we did not
have any measurement.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.780
The only measurement that we
had to compare with was the

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.730
temperature at the axes
of the cylinder.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:28.720
Notice that at 300 seconds,
the axes, as well as the

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.600
surface, basically all points
in the cylinder have reached

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.390
20 degrees Celsius.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:40.000
The next slide now shows the
results obtained in the

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.380
laboratory regarding the
residual stress field.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.050
Here we see as a functional
of the radius through the

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:50.310
cylinder, the residual stresses,
circumferential

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:55.430
stress, sigma phi phi,
longitudinal stress, sigma zz,

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:59.890
and radius stress, sigma rr,
once again, as obtained in the

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.720
laboratory.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.620
We wanted to compare our
calculated results obtained

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.480
with the finite element
solution with

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.290
these laboratory results.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.680
And the next slide shows the
results obtained in the finite

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.640
element analysis.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.360
Sigma phi phi, sigma
zz, and sigma rr.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.270
And if you compare these results
with the results

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.170
obtained in the laboratory,
you see a very close

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:25.250
correspondence.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.050
In fact, an excellent
correspondence for this very

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.670
complex problem that
is considered here.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.980
Notice that we are making
various assumptions on the

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.930
material model level.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:40.240
In other words, a bilinear
material assumption, et

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.050
cetera, et cetera, for
this analysis.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.660
If you are interested in the
details, please refer to the

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.710
paper in which we are describing
this analysis in

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.760
much more depth, and the
references given

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.260
in the study guide.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.590
This then brings me to the end
of what I wanted to discuss

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.900
with you in this lecture.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.650
At closing I like to really
mention to you that we have,

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:11.660
in these two lectures in which
we discussed elasto-plasticity

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.180
and creep response as modeled in
finite element analysis, we

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.100
have in these two lectures
really covered only quite a

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.740
bit of the material that is
worthwhile looking at, and

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.800
studying, and getting
familiar with.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.850
The elasto-plasticity and creep
response of structures

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.320
is, of course, a very large
field, and we have just taken

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.270
two lectures to cover some of
the aspects as we use them in

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.650
finite element analysis.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.985
There's a lot more we
could talk about.

00:47:38.985 --> 00:47:40.235
But thank you for
your attention.

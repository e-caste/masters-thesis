00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.387
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:09.470
In lecture you've been
learning about applications

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.170
of integration.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.860
And one of them
is how to compute

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.420
average values of a function.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.800
So I have a nice average
value problem for you here.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.410
So Christine was out jogging
one day and she saw a bear,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.360
and so she broke into a sprint.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.930
She starts speeding up,
and her velocity t seconds

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
after she started sprinting
is given by v of t

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.960
equals 1500 divided by
the quantity 100 plus

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.960
t minus 5 squared, the
whole thing minus 7.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.280
And it's in meters per second.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.330
So OK, so she starts
at t equals 0,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.630
she's going 1500 divided by
125, so that's 12 minus 7,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.250
so 5 meters per second.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.370
And she starts to speed
up and after 5 seconds

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.160
she's going 1500
divided-- well this is 0--

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.430
so she's going 8 meters
per second at 5 seconds.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.930
And then she looks
over her shoulder

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.180
and she sees, oh no,
it wasn't up a bear,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.250
it was just an unkempt
math graduate student,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.590
so then she starts
to slow down again.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.720
She slows back down and
10 seconds later she's

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.140
back to her original velocity.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.520
So the question is, over the
10 seconds of this sprint,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.240
she sped up, she slowed
down, from 5 meters

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.680
per second to 8 meters per
second and then back to 5.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.380
What was her average
velocity over this time?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.550
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.100
to work that out, come back
and we can work on it together.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.460
So hopefully you had some
luck working on this problem.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.220
I have over on my left here
a little picture of the graph

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.000
of this function v of t.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.510
I described it to you
earlier, but just you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.780
see, OK, so it starts at 5,
after 5 seconds it's at 8,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.390
and then it goes back
down to 5 at 10 seconds.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.760
So this is roughly
the picture, so we

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.570
have a feel for what
we're working with.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.780
Now what we want to compute
is the average velocity

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.890
over this time.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.900
So anytime you have to
compute an average value

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.040
of any function
what you want to do,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.400
you always do the same thing.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.380
So you want to compute the total
contribution of that function

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.670
over the interval in question.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.470
So you want to add it up,
you want to integrate it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930
over the interval in question.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.346
But then you want to divide
by the length of the integral.

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:20.160
So in particular, when you
have a velocity function what

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.950
that means is, you
integrate the velocity.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.100
So that gives you the
total distance traveled,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.350
and then you divide
by the time interval.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.950
S you're just taking total
distance divided by total time.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.130
So in this case we can write
down this average value.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.380
So I'm going to use
just a made up notation.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.810
I'm going to write avg, for
average, of v, so what is it?

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.770
Well the first
thing I have to do

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.140
is I want to not
forget to divide

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.420
by the length of
the interval here.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.460
So in this case, the
interval is from 0 to 10,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.510
so it has length 10
minus 0, which is 10.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.872
So I want 1/10 in front and
what I want to multiply this by,

00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:00.770
is I want to multiply
by the integral

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.610
over this entire interval
of my function v.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.390
So I just take the formula that
I had over there for v and I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.950
plop it down into my integral.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.100
So it's the integral
from 0 to 10

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:21.780
of 1500 divided by 100 plus
t minus 5 quantity squared

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.210
minus 7 dt.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.630
So this integral is the average
value that we're looking for.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.130
OK.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.030
So now we have to go
about evaluating it.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.210
Now, this looks kind of ugly,
but actually it's not that bad.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.880
I mean, one thing you can
notice, so the minus 7 part,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.600
that's going to be
easy to take care of.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.130
And then in this more
complicated part, well

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.100
there's a kind of obvious
substitution here.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.920
You can set u equal
t minus 5, that'll

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.291
simplify it a little bit.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.790
and then what you'll
see is that you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.730
have an integrand of the
form something divided

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.160
by 100 plus u squared.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
And so that's 10
squared plus u squared.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.450
So that should keep-- and
the something as a constant.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.380
So that should put you in the
mind of a tangent substitute,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.235
or just even not
by substitution,

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:07.610
you can just
remember that that's

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.730
an arctangent type of thing
that you're going to get out.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.450
so I'm not going to go through
all the steps of doing that,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.060
but we should get at the end--
well OK, so I've got this 1/10

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.780
out in front, so I have
to not forget about that.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.119
I get 1/10 times,
I've gone ahead

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:26.660
and I've computed
the anti-derivative

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:37.880
and it's 150 times arctan of
the quantity t minus 5 over 10.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.390
So here's that t minus 5, that's
the same t minus 5 over there

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.010
that's coming out.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.670
Minus 7t.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.310
And you want to take that
between t equals 0 and t equals

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.485
10.

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:55.110
So this is, I've
just, I've gone ahead,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.780
I've computed the
anti-derivative for us.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.510
There's my 1/10 because
I'm doing an average value

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.650
and then I'm, it's
a definite integral

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.860
and so I'm using fundamental
theorem of calculus;

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.210
there are my bounds.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.535
OK, so now we just have
to plug in and evaluate.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:08.951
So this is equal
to, so let's see.

00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:14.580
So we've got when we put in
t equals 10-- well the 1/10

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:24.200
and the 150 gives me a 15--
arctan of 1/2 minus-- well it's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.037
1/10 of 7 times 10, it's just 7.

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:31.120
That's from the first one.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.380
And from the second
one I guess minus--

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:41.180
so it's going to be 15
arctan of minus 1/2.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.570
When I put in t equals 0,
and when I put in t equals 0,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.380
the 7t is just 0.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.152
OK.

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:47.110
This is a little messy.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.615
We can simplify it a little bit,
because, remember arctangent is

00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:51.940
an odd function.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.230
So arctan of minus x is
minus arctangent of x.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.940
So minus 15 arctan minus 1/2 is
the same as just 15 arctan 1/2.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.472
And so we can combine those.

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:04.430
So we can rewrite that.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.860
Let's go all the way over here.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:14.760
We can rewrite this as
30 arctan 1/2 minus 7.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.740
So that's about it as nice a
form as you can make this take.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.910
If you wanted to plug
it into a calculator,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.940
I think you'd see that this
is approximately equal to 6.9

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.720
and I guess the units there are
going to be meters per second.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.870
So her average
velocity over this time

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.310
is about 6.9 meters per second.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.360
Let's just quickly
recap what we did.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360
So we started all
the way back here

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.650
with this velocity
function v, and we

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.760
wanted to compute it's average
value over the interval 0

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.890
less than or equal to t,
less than or equal to 10.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.840
So we did what we always do
in problems of that sort.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.900
So we came over
here, and whenever

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.510
you want to compute
an average value,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.380
you take 1 divided by the length
of the interval in question,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.780
times-- then just you
integrate the function who's

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.000
average value you want
over the interval.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.750
OK?

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.130
And so then we computed, well
we didn't show any of the steps,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.460
but we computed the
definite integral

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.390
by taking the anti-derivative
and plugging in

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.900
and it happened that the answer
worked out to be about 6.9.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.600
So there you go.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.139
I'll stop there.

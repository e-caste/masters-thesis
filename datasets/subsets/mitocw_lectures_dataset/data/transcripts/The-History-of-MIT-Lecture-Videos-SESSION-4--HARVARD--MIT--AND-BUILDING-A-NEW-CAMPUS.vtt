00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.520
PROFESSOR: OK, well, Mark
Jarzombek is a professor of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
architecture here and has
written this really

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.230
interesting book.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.360
MARK JARZOMBEK: So if you have
any questions about something

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.660
you don't understand, or you
need to clarify or elaborate,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.175
just raise your hand
and say so.

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.940
I just sort of picked
some images out.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.710
First, I'm sure you've seen
the Rogers Building, which

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.040
doesn't exist anymore,
as you know.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.030
I mean, this building
still exists.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.890
I'm not sure what happened
to the store.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.225
Did they go bankrupt?

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:03.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.390
But this was torn down.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.090
But what I point out in my book
is that if we look at

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.720
this and we go, well, it's
1860s, and you want to make a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.850
building for an institute that
does sciences, what do you do?

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.650
I mean, what should
it look like?

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.670
And so we may look at this and
say, well, it's sort of a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.740
building like any
other building.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.340
But it's sort of a bit of a
problem because that type of a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.000
building didn't really exist.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.470
So the architect did something
that was pretty clever, but

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.230
also says something about
the world view.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.070
Basically the building is
modeled a little bit on the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.880
Apsley House.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.520
And basically is a gentleman's
residence.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.330
So you want to make
a building.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.440
You want to make scientist and
technology guys, miners

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.530
walking around in their big
boots, you want to tell them

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740
that they're basically not just
doing technology, but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.810
basically they're gentlemen.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.080
So the students that are coming
in here are meant to be

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.070
raised at a level of gentlemen
in the 19th

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.970
century sense of that.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.630
They're sort of cultural
holders of a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.930
type of cultural thing.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.270
They're not just wandering
around, shuffling around with

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.060
slide rulers in their hand
thinking about science.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.720
They have a certain
status in society.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.370
So basically this is a
gentleman's residence that is,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.700
then, sort of designed on the
inside to be a school.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.780
So this says something about the
transition of science into

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.360
legitimacy.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.310
And the type of premodern notion
signs, where science

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.820
was still associated with sort
of a gentlemanly class and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.160
gentlemanly behavior.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.740
So that is MIT's first
source of claim,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.110
which was very expected.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.250
Perhaps you think of the
mid-19th century worldview.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.560
Of course, what happens is that
MIT grows gangbusters and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.590
starts to spread out
in every direction.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.930
So there you see the
Rogers Building.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.690
And then there's their Walker
building, which is a chemistry

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.780
building, a beautiful
building.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.820
One of the first buildings
specifically designed for

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.710
chemical fumes and so forth.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.030
And then here and there and
right and left, the campus

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.630
expands around Copley Square
into warehouses and into sheds

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.570
and other things.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.590
The Lowell Laboratory
gets built here.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.560
But as you can see, after
a while, it's

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.810
something like 20 buildings.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.730
The face was that not only is
the buildings all over around

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.880
Copley Square--

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.036
which is difficult if you want
to go from class to class in

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:56.850
the middle of a snowstorm--

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.770
but also, science was
changing, too.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.530
So the professors were
complaining they needed dust

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.690
free environments to
do certain things.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.290
They needed laboratories that
won't shake every time the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.250
beer truck rumbles by.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.810
So if you're in the middle of
a city, 19th century cities

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.630
where unbelievably stinky, fumy
places filled with black

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.040
soot from chimneys.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.000
I mean, today clean air law has
done a lot to our cities.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.120
But you've got to imagine, into
the winter the heavy odor

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.650
and cloud of soot making
everything sort of black.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.210
And so if you do any experiments
that require

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.830
special atmospheres,
and this and that.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.270
So the professors were
complaining about

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.130
being in the city.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.070
They wanted to be away from the
city, away from the noise,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.170
and the pollution, and
the sounds, and all

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.880
that type of stuff.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.770
So this was sort of one
of the problems

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.130
that the faculty faced.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.960
And one of the reasons
that spread along

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.670
the desire to move.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.220
So then the question was,
well, what you do?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.070
So you need a bigger building.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.840
So the model for this was
actually in Europe, mainly in

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.210
Germany, and then Switzerland.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.490
So the ETH was created, you see,
almost at the same time,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.450
but designed a little
bit earlier.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.640
Gigantic building.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.660
So here, I mean, this makes MIT
look, I mean, literally,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.710
like a joke compared to what
the Swiss investment in

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.010
technology was at that time.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.680
Huge building, massive amount of
laboratories, huge library.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.590
I mean, this was an institution
of gigantic scale.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.300
So here we have the United
States trying to create some

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.070
enthusiasm for the independence
of science and

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.000
learning and technology as
a material, and basically

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.370
adopting, initially at least,
not the German model, which

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.890
was that this is a massive
institution supported by the

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.780
state government.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.850
And it still is.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.270
The ETH is financed and
supported by the state

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.590
government.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.920
If you're a professor there,
the prime minister has to,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.985
ultimately, accept your
tenure proposal, not

00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:22.140
the university president.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.660
Whereas MIT adopted sort of the
English gentleman model.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.070
Which is very low key,
different worldview.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.300
Ultimately, of course,
this wins out.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.080
But the transition
is what's sort of

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.160
interesting about this.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.790
So Robert Ware, who's founded
the School of

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.850
Architecture here.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.730
"The first principle of
architecture is truthfulness,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.970
good sense, perspicuity.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.670
Considerations of method,
order, form, clearness,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.280
precision, sobriety, are what
make a good working style,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.600
both in writing and in
building." So in other words,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.460
he's describing a building.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.560
But in reality, he's also
describing what it means to be

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.770
a gentleman.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.130
A gentleman is truthful,
and good, and has great

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.510
perspicuity.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.300
Order, form, clearness,
precision, sobriety--

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.120
this is what you tell
a young man to be.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.770
So in some sense, we can sort
of read through some of the

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.620
architectural mandate a type of
relationship to, in fact,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.720
MIT's mandate, which was
what kind of men--

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.780
because it was all men in those
days-- what kind of man

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.030
are we trying to shape here?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.630
But then, of course,
the world changed.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:44.540
So in 1863, we have the four
categories, of which basically

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.670
fine arts and architecture
is the only one

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.820
that survives as such.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.130
Course four is the only one that
sort of keeps us going.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.060
But you see in 1873 all
of a sudden we have

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.840
different type of world.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.090
It's astonishing how in
basically 10 years, MIT's

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.860
mindset has changed.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.650
So before, we had agriculture.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.700
Farmer Joe wanted to figure
out how to lay

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.190
out a field, right?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.120
Well, agriculture, we don't
do agriculture anymore.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.570
I mean, go out in
Kansas for that.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.860
At the top of the heap is
civil engineering now.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.850
So you can sort of see, you go
from an institution that is

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.650
really sort of about
agriculture, geology,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.169
chemistry, very sort
of oddly primitive.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:34.900
I don't know, you know?

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.270
It's sort of an institution
where we could sort of see

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.390
modernity being formed.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.000
So civil engineering, mechanical
engineering,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.500
geology, architecture
stays, chemistry.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.840
So here, history, geology, and
chemistry were all one

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.630
department.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.010
Maybe it's sort of a little
bit hard to imagine that.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.650
You know, natural history,
geology, and chemistry all

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.270
being sort of one thing.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.250
But we sort of imagine that
during this time, there was

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:12.730
still debate about, let's
say, for example,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.890
what do you call these?

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.390
Dinosaur bones in the sand.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.420
What do you call them?

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.920
Fossils.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.260
AUDIENCE: Fossils.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.910
MARK JARZOMBEK: Right, right.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.860
You don't know, OK.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.060
So up until 1820, 1830, they
all said that God put the

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.680
fossils there because they were
the mistakes that when he

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.930
made heaven and earth, he
made a few mistakes.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.980
So he put them in the ground
so no one would see them.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.550
And this was a current theory.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.940
And people thought this
was sort of it.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.350
So geology was sort of having to
do with divinity, in a way.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.840
Because when you started
digging, you encounter fossil.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.290
It's like, there's
God's mistake.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.370
And it's like, what
do you do with it?

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.370
I mean, he should cover it up.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.000
So geology, chemistry,
everything, these ideas were

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.300
still floating around.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.490
I mean, not so much here.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.600
But you can sort of see geology
wasn't what this is.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.060
And you can see where
geology is going.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.630
It goes from just looking
at stones to mining.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.270
Which we can sort of see by the
time we get to 1900 a much

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.170
more sort of precise focus of
how the sciences sort of

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.410
operate in the real world now.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.920
Here this is sort of
all very abstract.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.640
Here we see the emergence of
whole new genres of reality.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.110
We have a philosophy
department.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.570
Philosophy disappears and then,
in a funny way, sort of

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.770
comes back in the
20th century.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.110
So philosophy is still the
holdover of the idea that you

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.590
should know something
about the world in a

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.190
philosophical way.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.430
So by 1873, we see the
emergence of the

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:45.220
professionalization of the
sciences, which means

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.910
professional journals,
publications.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.900
And think, all the things we
assume completely normal today

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.500
just really didn't exist,
actually, until really into

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.980
the 1880s and 1890s, sort of
journal publications and peer

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.020
reviewed publications, and
so forth like that.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.950
So then by 1900, we see we
have now 13 departments.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.060
So it's sort of growing
exponentially.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.510
And it has continued to grow.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.060
We got, I don't know,
23 AB now.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.760
I mean, we're at least
in the mid '20s.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.100
And we see new things.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.320
America's just had the
Spanish American War.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.670
Naval ships for the Defense
Department are important.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.170
So we have a Naval architecture
thing.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.250
The cities in the turn of the
century were really terrible,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.580
complicated, messy places.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.080
The streets were not paved.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.930
There were sewage problems,
and so forth, and so on.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.810
So sanitary engineering comes
into play along with sort of

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.600
the conventional type thing.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.200
So we have new departments and
new programs being developed.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.810
But the point is, in some sense,
what we get here is

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.880
really the modern notion of
science that we just assume is

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.610
completely normal.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.630
We see it literally happening,
if you will, decade by decade,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.600
rapidly changing into the
professional world that we

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.740
have today.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.920
So the model of a gentleman's
villa, it is

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.550
just clearly not working.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.600
But of course, the building
remained to be functional for

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.410
a long time.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.910
So the first attempt to, in some
sense, modernize MIT's

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.600
look was the Walker building.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.750
Here's the Rogers Building
next to it.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.240
And at first you go, well,
it doesn't look

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.760
all that much different.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.560
But it was designed with
these chimneys.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.200
You see the air vent chimneys on
the exterior facade so that

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.700
the chemistry laboratories would
have these vents going

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.940
up to vent the fumes.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.910
So instead of hiding the
chimneys, the chimneys become,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.860
in fact, part of the
whole architecture.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.410
And basically it's sort of the
first real attempt to make a

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.760
laboratory building at
a monumental scale.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.550
This is in Copley Square,
right across

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.840
from Trinity Church.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.610
This is one of the best real
state areas in the city.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.770
And to put a chemistry lab
there, I mean, it's like, oh,

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.340
you got to be kidding
me, right?

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.570
So it shows the capacity to sort
of start to think of what

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.890
a science building is
at an urban scale.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.820
But still, it's a relatively
small building.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.150
They were living in these
type of warehouses.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.880
This was the architecture
building

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.630
and engineering building.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.800
Which were useful, because you
could much around in there.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.320
And there was no damage
done, really, if you

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.410
banged in to something.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.560
They made some of these
experiments.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.580
They made the lower laboratory
down here, which at the time

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.980
would have been the most
advanced laboratory for

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.640
electrical engineering.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.310
They only used it
for a few years.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.220
The building contractor was
a guy called Gilbreth.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.670
Everybody seen Cheaper
By The Dozen?

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.000
Well, anyway, he's the one who
built the building using new

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.530
techniques.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.950
Because he was famous.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.260
You know what he
was famous for?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.210
The guy, Gilbreth?

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:21.220
Well, he was interested in
making labor less expensive.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.270
So the ways you do that is you
study, let's say, you take a

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.480
bricklayer.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.070
And the bricklayer's got
to go get a brick.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.570
And then he's got to bring
the brick down.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.060
And then he's got to
put a brick in.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.810
Then he's hungry.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.716
They he puts the chewing
gum in his mouth.

00:14:33.716 --> 00:14:35.610
And he slathers something
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.010
Well, he figured out that
takes a lot of time.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.390
So you have the dolly.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.730
And the dolly will
bring the brick.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.870
One guy gives the brick.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.940
The other guy puts it down.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.920
The other guy slathers it.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.550
So your job is just to take
the brick and put it down.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.450
Take the brick, put it down.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.230
Take the brick, put it down.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.870
Take the brick.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.330
And the next guy's job is to
go-- kuh-chunk, kuh-chunk,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.690
kuh-chunk, kuh-chunk, kuh-chunk,
kuh-chunk.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.790
And you can build buildings a
lot faster if you do this

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.260
time-saving thing.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
He was the inventor--

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.190
or not the inventor but one
of the great champions of

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.390
time-saving labor.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.330
Ford Motor works would put it
into mass production window to

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.290
make a Model T Ford.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.940
So this was sort of advanced
technology at the

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.250
time, if you will.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.750
And of course, has debatable
effects.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.910
But anyway.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.270
So anyway, there he is, Mr.
Gilbreth, with his cheaper by

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.890
the dozen family.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:26.940
And so they hired him.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.800
In other words, they brought in
a new type of engineer to

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.185
experiment with a new
type of building.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.470
And so it shows MIT's
search for the

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.930
avant-garde of the time.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.030
So then you compare,
of course, that

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.290
there's MIT's building.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.290
And this is another building
from 1861.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.760
The Opera by Charles
Garnier in Paris.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.140
I don't know if you've
ever seen it.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.670
But if you go to Paris,
you should see it.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.350
It's certainly one of the great

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.510
buildings of the 19th century.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.220
I mean, [? vastly, ?] hugely

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.130
beautiful, extravagant building.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.790
So once again, in Europe,
they were making

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.320
these gigantic things.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.990
Whereas at MIT and Boston, there
were still small little

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.940
building after small
little building.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.450
But they this world, which
is sort of the Beaux-Arts

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:23.410
architecture here is sort of a
European development of how to

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.840
make these buildings work within
the city, and so forth.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.850
Wasn't really in the
United States yet.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.290
And I'd say its building styles
were still English

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.430
driven, still relatively small
scale, still relatively modest

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.870
in their desire in terms
of spacial expression.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.920
So around the world, you were
having these huge buildings

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.220
being built.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.930
And so here we are in Japan.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:56.890
Here's Cairo.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.720
I have to show you this because
this is the old

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.890
building from the
medieval period.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.990
And then they built this
gigantic mosque here in 1910.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.540
And the Cairo National Museum of
1900, which is in the news

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.160
a little bit today.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.180
So Boston around 1900 would
have looked like a real

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.849
gritty, brick, working
class place.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.569
Very few prestigious buildings,
nothing really

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:26.720
grand about the place at all.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.700
You had the Back Bay that
had been laid out.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.210
And you had some fine
residential quarters.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.770
But you really didn't have
high architecture, any

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.500
examples of high architecture
at all compared to almost

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.850
everywhere else around
the world.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:47.790
Well, in 1893, they brought in
this French architect, a guy

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:53.320
called Despradelle, to teach in
the school of architecture.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.730
And he sort of changed
everything because he brought

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:02.510
this much grander, much more
imposing sort of tradition of

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.870
sort of architectural
world that was in

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.600
Europe at the time.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.030
And it was sort of a risk.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.390
And so they bought this guy.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.420
As you can see, he's sort
of a strange character.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.330
The students sort
of loved him.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.510
He was very quirky much beloved
by the students.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.220
We taught them how to make these
absolutely drop dead

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.750
gorgeous drawings, some of
which are in the museum.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.680
Hopefully we can, one
day, exhibit them.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.980
This drawing, which was
gigantic, some 12 feet high or

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.070
something, was for a building,
of course,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.710
that was never built.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.350
I mean, it was impossible
to build at the time.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.980
Some huge, huge, huge, huge
monument sort of celebrating

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.860
the Americas called the
"Beacon of Progress."

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.070
So actually it looks a little
old fashioned, because it was,

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.440
like, not a modern building.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.770
But it would have been
a really very

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.060
early use of concrete.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.090
It was actually a very
interesting type of edifice.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.920
And so we have to see it as much
more progressive than we

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.360
today might see things.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.670
And then he went around and
bought drawings for the

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.020
students to learn.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.210
So this is another one of the
leading architects of the

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.306
time, a guy called
Viollet-le-Duc.

00:19:15.306 --> 00:19:18.930
And he and Ware basically
brought all these drawings

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.580
from Europe for the architects
to look at to teach them.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.990
So we have, of course, in the
process, then, drawing

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.370
capitals and things like that
for presentation drawing.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.740
So all of a sudden, the
principle of architecture,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.840
prestige, quality buildings
sort of comes into play.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.240
And these are just drawings
from the archives made by

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.590
students here at the turn
of the century.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.310
So the point is that basically
he changes the architectural

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:57.270
culture that's taught here
from just basically more

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.260
pragmatic architectural
buildings to be a type of

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.790
culture that really speaks
to high-end architectural

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.330
production.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.120
And MIT is really the
first place in the

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.210
country which does that.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.400
Now that means you and I will
look at this, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.050
all sort of old fashioned.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.610
We look at this and go, oh,
this is the stuff that

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.330
modernism sort of got rid of.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.010
But this would be a
bit of a mistake--

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:26.140
this is a synagogue
that was planned--

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:31.160
largely because 1900 and that
era was an interesting moment

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.020
in history.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.260
There was the Spanish
American War.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.430
And the two sort of, I
guess, events was the

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.635
market crash of 1893.

00:20:40.635 --> 00:20:43.430
1893 was the first stock market
crash in the United

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.020
States, the first great one.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.860
It's like we never learn.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.260
It was another big bank
financial scandal of too many

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.450
people buying too much land.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.220
And then all of a sudden,
it went belly up.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.350
It was like, duh.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.530
So anyway, and basically
everybody was out of a job.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.280
I mean, probably about 10 times
worse than what we have

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.150
today, what we just recently
experienced.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.090
And probably not quite as
bad as the crash of '29.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.560
But a significant shock
to the system.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.580
And after that, the United
States' warehouses were filled

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.960
with stuff that no
one could buy.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.830
So what they did was they
made it very cheap.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.270
And they shipped it
around the world.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.830
And basically the United States,
afterward from 1893,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.410
basically became an
international supplier of

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.290
things, in particular steel.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:36.360
So it discovered international
markets after 1893.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.980
Then came the Spanish American
War, where America now was a

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.570
quasi-colonial imperial power.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:48.270
So by 1900, the United States
had established itself as a

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.350
network, global, expanding
trade world.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.080
And it wanted to market itself
in particular ways.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.970
Well, what you could market,
of course, is architecture.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.980
So MIT knows by teaching its
students how to make these big

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.660
and huge and grand buildings,
whilst preparing them for big

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.550
time commissions around
the world.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.130
And it's not just these
commissions.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.000
But it was the steel that came
from the steel factories.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.250
It was the parts that
came from the

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.710
American parts factories.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.090
It was the labor and the
contractors that came from the

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.910
labor contractor.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.890
So this was all originally
controlled by the French,

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.360
largely, who built their
buildings as export

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:27.850
commodities.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.140
Now MIT's Department of
Architecture really was sort

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.010
of at the cusp of basically
producing architecture as an

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.190
export commodity.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.150
So it's not just that this
Beaux-Arts architecture, as we

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.490
call it today, is sort
of frilly and cute.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.510
It basically was the first
world export commodity.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.650
Because to make a building,
you need steel, you need

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.540
foundations, you need

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.870
technology, you need engineers.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.320
At the end, it might look
sort of interesting.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320
But it's the whole package.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.040
So this is why MIT
developed this.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.220
And meanwhile, Harvard
was looking at this.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:07.380
And they said, well, if MIT is
gambling for the Beaux-Arts

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.530
and the principle of world
domination, we think that this

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.600
is sort of not correct.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.970
And we want architecture to be
humble and appropriate to the

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:17.960
human scale.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.570
And so they went into
sort of the

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.100
anti-internationalist phase.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.880
They went into what's called
the arts and crafts.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.670
So whereas MIT went into sort
of internationalism,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.050
Beaux-Arts, huge buildings,
Harvard brought in faculty

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.650
that made little
Gothic things.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:41.340
Very beautiful, very sweet,
very elegant.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.990
William Brigham was one of
the professors there.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.880
And these are the things
that he made.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:54.160
And you compare that with Allen
Ross, who is a graduate

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.800
from here, who went
out and built huge

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.570
buildings like this.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:05.780
Or Hood, a graduate from MIT
who went off and did the

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.440
Chicago Tribune.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.620
He did other buildings, the
Rockefeller Center, designed

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.360
part of the Rockefeller Center,
which were gigantic

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.790
buildings, all about
the progressive

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.740
spirit and so forth.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.470
So this was the two approaches
that MIT and Harvard had at

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.000
the time in architecture.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.900
MIT went for big-scale,
urban, huge projects.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.280
Harvard went for the little
scale, for the domestic, for

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.020
the house, and so forth.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.240
Eventually MIT would
win that argument.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.620
I mean, it is a short term or
long term perspective on that.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.070
And Harvard would eventually
bring in a French architect in

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.230
the first decades of
the 20th century.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.450
And that was sort of the end
of the arts and crafts.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.720
And so one of the characters
that sort of comes in is, of

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.390
course, Bosworth, who
is a product of MIT.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.800
So he, in some sense, is a
student of Despradelle.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.060
He knows and understands
Despradelle's principle of

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:07.670
buildings that represent the
big international scale.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.740
Not buildings that are going to
be humble, and sweet, and

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.830
Gothic, and nostalgic.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:18.380
So the project that he designs
for MIT is at that large,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.310
international scale.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.590
It's meant to be
big and grand.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:28.680
Now he worked for
various people.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:36.120
But including a man called
Fish-- who was an AT&T CEO--

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.710
and Ware, and some other people,
and Rockefellers.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.360
He was sort of like a
gentleman's architect.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.600
He didn't have a big practice.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.770
He had a small practice.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.060
But basically these super rich
people would bring him in to

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.660
design buildings.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.640
So this is one of the
buildings are

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.760
designed in New York.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.450
It's literally right next to,
no longer the World Trade

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:59.230
Center, the towers which you
don't see anymore, which would

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.570
be right there.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.650
So if any of you know New York,
the Wall Street area,

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.510
you would hopefully know
this building.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:11.140
Really a gorgeous building,
strictly neoclassical.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.410
It has a Doric on the inside,
ionic on the outside.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.770
But it's a steel building.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.540
Basically it's a modern steel
building wrapped in

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.790
this sort of casing.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:24.920
And the casing is meant to show
the stability of AT&T,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.880
the magnificence
of it as well.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.050
So these buildings, which we
may look at as sort of a

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.730
little bit old fashioned were,
at that time, all about the

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.130
bravura of these new

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.110
corporations that were emerging.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.100
So in particular,
sort of AT&T--

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.470
AUDIENCE: Is that the West
Street building?

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.547
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah.

00:26:43.547 --> 00:26:44.975
AUDIENCE: That's where
Bell Labs is

00:26:44.975 --> 00:26:46.050
founded, in that building.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:46.900
Bell Labs is founded
in that building.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.460
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah,
that's right.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.006
Bell Labs is founded here.

00:26:50.006 --> 00:26:52.970
That's right.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:59.710
So when MIT, then, was making
the move, they didn't talk to

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:00.410
Bosworth initially.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.650
It came a little bit later.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:04.720
There's this huge institution.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.710
They're having these problems.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.870
And they were going, well, we
need to find somebody to make

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.340
the design.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.900
So they hire this guy
called Childs.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.835
Childs was an expert in
sanitation engineering.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:20.820
He made the sewer lines
for Brookline.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.350
I mean, OK, he's an
OK architect.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.300
But I mean, the guy
makes sewer lines,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.260
for crying out loud.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.240
So he made a project.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.755
And at first, it looks OK.

00:27:29.755 --> 00:27:31.240
He's got a thing.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.490
It's got an esplanade.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.240
It's got its funny towers,
and so forth like that.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:41.730
But fortunately, they realized
it's really bad.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.450
I mean, it's really, really,
really, really bad.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.030
So his idea was that
X marks the spot.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.040
I mean, literally.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.440
And that this line, if you
look at it, points to the

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.020
State House.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.520
Because the State House was
where the money comes from.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.470
So you want an avenue that when
I can look down, I can

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.720
see the State House
and say, thank you

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.500
very much, State House.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.210
Even though State House was
giving it practically nothing.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.190
They were practically
bankrupt.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.050
So I don't know where these
lines would be pointing to.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.980
But they're just off into
distance somewhere.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.920
And then, as you see, it's
not really symmetrical.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.970
One has got longer.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.130
And then you see there's
a track.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.630
And you see here one building
bumps on the track.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.641
It's really sort of weird,
a weird building, right?

00:28:18.641 --> 00:28:20.510
So not a good architect.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.515
And obviously somebody
complained about it.

00:28:23.515 --> 00:28:25.510
Well, the guy who complained
about it was this man called

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.060
Freeman who was a civil engineer
who would later go

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.520
off and design the canals
for Panama Canal.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.260
So this was a really
top civil engineer.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.000
And compared to, if you will,
some local hokey-bonky

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.120
architect that they
found in some sort

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.150
of neighboring village.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.090
So Freeman comes on the plane
and says, we've got to get rid

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.750
of all these architects.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.390
They don't know what they're
talking about.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:54.070
And convinces the president,
Maclaurin, to fund him to do

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.970
some research on what
MIT needs to do.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.280
So he travels around
the world.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:58.900
He goes to Mexico.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.360
He goes to the United States.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.790
He goes to Canada.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.840
He goes to Germany, and
France, and Italy.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.770
And he collects this portfolio
of plans and photographs.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.440
And then produces his report
that I publish at

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.320
the end in my book.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.730
And he falls in love with the
German model of buildings,

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.100
like the ones that
I had showed you.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.030
And he said that the Germans
and the Swiss had come up

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.480
already 50 years earlier
with this

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.050
notion of a giant building.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.000
Not one building in sort
of the landscape in the

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.140
gentlemanly fashion.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.250
But huge, mega structures that
if you go to Berlin, and you

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.440
go to the Technical University
in Berlin, or these

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.700
universities in Zurich.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.770
And so he puts the map
of them together.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.710
And he says, this is
what MIT should do.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.660
I mean, this is what we need.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.125
We need a mega structure,
not just a little

00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:47.700
old building somewhere.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.870
And then to make his point, he
makes a design which he says,

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.560
OK, this is what a bad
architect would do.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.860
We'll have the architecture
department.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.710
We have a chemistry
department.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.930
We have a physics department.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.350
We've got an electrical
department.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.860
We got some labs.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.160
We'll just scatter them around,
whatever, willy-nilly,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.970
and call that a campus.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.190
And so he makes this sort of
fake plan, if you will, to

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.550
show this is how we would do it
if we wanted to be a little

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.250
bit like Harvard.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.080
And we might have a quad
in there, and so forth.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.960
He hated architects.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.500
He thought architects were
pompous arrowheads.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.470
He calls them beauty makers.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.270
And basically the
world should be

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.100
designed by civil engineers.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.030
And this was sort of an
interesting moment where MIT

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.590
Civil Engineering Department is
sort of asserting itself in

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.160
the architectural world against
the Beaux-Arts.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.180
So he doesn't like the
Beaux-Arts at all.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.900
He doesn't understand, really.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.430
Because basically by the 1910s,
and so forth, what is

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:47.310
being exported is precisely
dams, and bridges, and canals,

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.040
and so forth, not buildings.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.920
So this is where huge
investments of exportation of

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.670
MIT's position in the world
has to do with civil

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.740
engineering.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.730
And architecture's now a
little bit sort of on a

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.280
smaller scale.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.640
So his plan for MIT looks
actually quite like what MIT

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.710
looks like.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.340
Basically it's a concrete
building.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.410
Concrete, because
it won't burn.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.080
And today we go, concrete?

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.730
The hell with concrete.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.520
But you've got to remember,
the Romans had concrete.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.140
And then sometime in the Middle
Ages because they

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.080
didn't believe in science, they

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.250
forgot how to make concrete.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.500
And then no one knew
what concrete was.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.610
I mean, it had been completely
forgotten,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:26.880
basically, until the 1880s.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.240
And people were going, God, we
could make concrete now.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.660
So they started making
concrete.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.410
And people were very
uncertain about it.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.060
Because they needed to test it,
and stretch it, and all

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:37.460
these things.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.910
And then in the early 20th
century, they finally figured

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.120
out that by putting steel mesh
into the concrete, you can

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.860
sort of give it a substance.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.660
And it can both be compressed
and, in

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.060
some sense, also intention.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.660
So that made concrete into
a basically usable thing.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.190
But it was still seen as
sort of a low material.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.560
If you do a public building,
it had to be brick.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.180
Brick was seen as
prestigious--

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.420
stone, marble.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.340
The last thing you want
to do is concrete.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.180
The advantage of concrete, of
course, is that it's really

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.780
good against fires.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.340
And the building doesn't
shake when the

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.240
trucks go rumbling by.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.120
So he designed for this building
to be in concrete.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.060
And it would have been, and in
fact, when it was built, the

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.030
largest concrete building in the
world, some million square

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.040
feet, sort of giant structure.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.030
And that in itself is, in some
senses, another aspect of MIT

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.160
reaching out to a type of really
being the most modern

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.420
thing available.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.150
So this is another building
designed as a shoe olfactory.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.410
And you can sort of see it has
the same sort of principle, a

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.750
concrete structure with these
columns going down the middle

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.320
that become the corridor.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.200
And then all you have to do is
makes slabs, and then the

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.740
circulation system for people
to go up and down.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.190
So basically the concrete
columns,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.960
circulations in the corners.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.920
Here is an auditorium.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.680
And then behind here was various
laboratories for the

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.380
electrical engineers
and whatnot.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.060
So he did that.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.630
And MIT thought that was
all pretty good.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:18.180
But they got a little nervous
because they still wanted the

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.260
architects to come and give a
blessing to the building.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.460
They had this being built.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.020
Unfortunately, the skin of it
would have still had some

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.630
classical furnishings.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.620
Oh, he wanted the skin.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.910
The skin was going to be out of
ceramic, white ceramic, so

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.790
that you could wash it down.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.160
You got to remember, in the
winter all the soot makes all

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.480
the buildings black.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.690
So he didn't like that.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.870
So he invented this sort of
ceramic that you could just

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.650
hose down and the building would
be very gleaming in the

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.690
spring again.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.950
So all very clever, very
practical, very useful.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.280
But MIT was a little nervous.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.660
So they went to, as
many institutions

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.120
do, the power elite.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:02.090
So at some moment, President
Maclaurin called up

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:08.239
Rockefeller and said, hey,
Rocky, we're building a

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.219
building here.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.830
And can you recommend
something?

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.860
So Rockefeller, and this
is Theodore Vail.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.370
Theodore Vail's the President of
AT&T. And you see, he's on

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.320
the telephone.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:26.420
And he's in his little
bungalow in

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.229
Jekyll Point in Carolinas.

00:34:29.229 --> 00:34:31.360
They had a little
villa out there.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.080
And this is the first
transatlantic telephone call

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.760
from his little bungalow in
Jekyll Island-- and that's

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.639
where all the rich
people lived--

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.429
to California.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:45.009
So this is the moment where
he's calling this guy and

00:34:45.009 --> 00:34:46.889
talking to him in California.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.500
And so he's sitting next
to his buddy, another

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.060
millionaire, Rockefeller.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.730
And who are the people
behind him?

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.820
Well, they're his architects.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.780
So here he is at this
unbelievably amazing moment.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.720
And it could be his daughter.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.530
It could be his wife.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.990
It could be some engineers.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:12.610
But he wants to sort of
memorialize this moment by the

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.300
two guys being on
the telephone.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.320
And the architects are behind
them who are going to get the

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.265
commissions to build the
buildings that will represent

00:35:18.265 --> 00:35:20.090
them in the world.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.130
So we saw the one that Bosworth
has just done.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.990
You see him beautifully
attired.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.610
He knows how to dress
in those days.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.720
He's an MIT gentleman.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.280
And so basically we don't
know exactly all

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:33.940
of the ins and outs.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.310
But more or less, Maclaurin
basically calls up

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.420
both of these men.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.530
And they both say Bosworth
is the man to do it.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.720
So there was no competition.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.010
There was no announcement
in the paper

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.360
looking for an architect.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.450
There was no first they just
went down the street and found

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.900
the first shingle where the guy
said, I'm an architect.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.940
Here they called up the top CEOs
and said, we need a guy

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.480
who can do this building
that you trust.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.930
Because we don't need simply
someone who can make the

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.320
building in a pragmatic way.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.410
We need someone who can give
us the representational

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:12.070
capacity that architects
can bring.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.260
So they pointed to Bosworth.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.860
Now Bosworth used
Freeman's plans.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.290
Basically built Freeman's
building.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.430
Here it is, you can see.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.900
And had this been built more or
less like it was, and glass

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.310
put in, it would have been the
first, the largest, and the

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.090
most important modern building
in the history of ever.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:35.480
So 1913, it was just when
modernism was starting to be

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.190
discussed in Europe as well.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.410
But the Europeans would
eventually figure out they're

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.520
just putting glass.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.880
Let's get rid of all the skin.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.640
Americans were a little bit
more reluctant to do that.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.070
And so that's why the modernism
began in Europe.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.420
But this is basically a modern
building and would have been

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.380
in every history book had
they just stopped there.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.510
But they didn't.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.230
And they put the skin on it.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.680
But you can get a sense of
basically the sort of radical,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.050
modern, clean, functional
aesthetic that comes from

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.390
Freeman in some of the buildings
and some of the

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.490
rooms that are on the corner.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.380
This is an old room now.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.350
It's got a sunk ceiling.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.210
I mean, we do all this
stuff to it.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:20.770
And you get a very cushy,
different world today.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.360
But you get a little bit of a
sense of Vail, who wanted to

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.980
donate his library to MIT.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.170
And he wanted, of course,
Bosworth to design the dome to

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.530
house this library.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.440
So this is the Vail Library.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.090
And we see it as it was
originally was.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.720
Now today, it'd look like a
parking garage with these

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.110
stupid lamps.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.770
And of course, I mean, I just
go in there, I just really

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.010
want to vomit.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.880
It's just really, really,
really bad.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.950
And then in 1941, they
painted the dome.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.250
So they thought the German
airplane bombers were going to

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.270
come and bomb MIT.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.860
So they painted the dome so that
you could turn the lights

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.810
off and there wouldn't
be any lights.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.160
Of course, the German bombers
never made it to MIT.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.380
And everyone forgot to
take off the paint.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.840
So you go in there and
it's sort of dark.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.920
And you don't have the oculus,
you know, with this warmth of

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.790
the light coming down.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.645
And of course, these wonderful
chairs and people

00:38:13.645 --> 00:38:14.880
just reading there.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.060
Instead you've got these sort of
bean bags and kids sleeping

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.430
and snoring right and left.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.570
So hopefully that can be done
something about that.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.560
So Bosworth took the modern
building, basically, and

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.490
wrapped, as you can sort
of see, in a restrained

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:39.070
classical, not the glorious,
usually excessive classicism

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.250
that you might find
other places.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.890
But a relatively restrained
classicism.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:48.080
Very simple sandstone facade.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.470
And of course, the
front of it.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.740
Of course, the whole thing was
paved, because this was, in

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.350
some sense, the urban center
of the building.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:00.570
In the '20s and '30s, paving
is hard to do.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:01.080
You've got to maintain it.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.710
And if you don't maintain it,
things and weeds grow.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.510
And then the paving does
this and this.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.370
And finally, you just rip the
whole crap out and put in a

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.850
few plants.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.680
So that's what they did.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.320
And made it into a park so
that you can't see the

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:14.840
building at all.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.660
But the building was meant to
be sort of really, really

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.020
visible, this white, beautiful
structure, visible

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.880
from across the river.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.580
Clearly a statement of

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.790
constitutionality in the landscape.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.920
And then it was opened in a
big celebration where Vail

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.350
gave all the MIT alumni in the
various clubs around the

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.210
country headsets.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.220
I think this is in Kansas.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.900
And so they're all listening to
the speech that was taking

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.960
place during the opening
ceremony, you

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.820
know, all at the same.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.390
So it was the first sort
of simulcast--

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.820
I don't know, that wouldn't
be the right phrase--

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.210
simultaneous transmission
of sound in the

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.220
history of the world.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.370
And to make sure that people
understood, there was a

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:09.560
relationship between AT&T and
his donor, Vail, and MIT.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.800
So this is the front of
the AT&T headquarters.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.830
And here you can see
the doors of them.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.680
And here you see the doors of
MIT, which are basically the

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.930
same doors.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.810
So when you walk into the
doors, you're basically

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.330
walking into the doors that
say, thank you, Mr.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.260
Vail for your gift.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.180
I mean, it's a bad photograph.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.770
Just take my word for it.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.120
It's the same doors.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.350
It says so even on the
construction drawings, copied

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.310
the drawings from the
AT&T headquarters.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.270
So MIT's relationship with
AT&T, with electrical

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:49.090
engineering, with this
progressive corporate world is

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.670
sort of cemented in
the building.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.060
So the building we could say
looks like classical.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.870
But in reality, what it's doing
is giving MIT what it

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.840
really wanted, which was a type
of relationship to the

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.560
corporate America.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.740
Corporate America we
assume has been

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.520
around for 8,000 years.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.080
It really hasn't.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.000
It really starts to emerge,
these giant corporations,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.650
exactly at this moment.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.430
So at that level, this building
does what was

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.120
happening in corporate
America, too.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.820
These large, impressive,
institutional buildings in the

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.070
landscape that are referring to
the classical past as a way

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.630
to sort of stabilize the idea
that we're here forever.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.900
Even though we're only a few
years old, don't worry, like

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.800
the Doric columns, we'll be
around for a long time.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.350
Good luck.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:39.290
So of course, this building
refers partially to the dome

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.005
of the Pantheon in Rome.

00:41:41.005 --> 00:41:44.690
I hope some of you
have seen that.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:45.810
So we have the dome.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.013
And then we have these sort
of columns in front.

00:41:48.013 --> 00:41:52.290
There are eight columns in front
of the real Pantheon.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:55.230
Whereas there are 10 columns
sort of here.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.830
And of course, the dome
is much, much,

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.730
much, much, much, higher.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.185
Because the dome in the
Pantheon is very low.

00:42:00.185 --> 00:42:02.620
And actually, you don't
see it all.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.410
You can sort of see it if you're
way up high and you can

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:06.060
sort of photograph it.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.280
But from the street level, you
don't see the dome at all.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.250
So it's not an imitation.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.350
But clearly, obviously he's
saying the dome of the

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.190
Pantheon is one of the
great buildings.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.070
Clearly the pantheon translated

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.660
into the idea of learning.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.400
And so the Enlightenment project
of the unification of

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.220
the sciences.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.420
So that's sort of part of it.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.940
The other part, of course, is
that if you look at the dome

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.780
of the Pentagon, you'll notice
these capitals are what you

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.710
call Corinthian, which is sort
of a typical type of capital

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:45.100
that was developed in Rome that
does not match up with

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.240
here, which is capitals that
are called ionic, which are

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.860
actually Greek.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.070
And they're a lot older.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:55.520
So he's sort of playing with
these languages to craft a

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.280
type of MIT message.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.400
So the model that he's
taken is the Temple

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.390
of Athena in Priene.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:08.520
Priene was a Greek town
in Western Turkey.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.970
And so he's using the capitals,
which I show here,

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.400
from that temple.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.450
So he wants Athena to be in
there, because Athena's

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.020
[? learning. ?]

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.430
Among classicists, this temple
is supposed to be seen as the

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:24.680
most perfect temple that
had ever been built.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.460
And if you do architectural
history, you would know that.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:33.070
So he takes the capital
of Priene here and

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.130
basically copies it.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.160
So when you walk in building
seven up on the third floor,

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.600
you see these gigantic
capitals.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:43.310
Well, why spend $2,500 and go
to Turkey and look at it?

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.590
Well, you can look at
it right there.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.020
I mean, they're sort
of the same thing.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.715
But as you can see, the
bottoms are different.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.530
Now I know you guys
are like, ugh.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.220
They all had bottoms.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.580
But bottoms--

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.900
it's a whole story.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.340
So he's taking the top
but not the bottom.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.670
So where do the bottoms
come from?

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:05.940
Well, the bottoms come from
another temple in Athens

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.740
called the Erechtheion.

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.010
So here you see MIT's bases.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.210
And compared to the Erechtheion,
they're pretty

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:14.500
much a perfect match.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.000
The Erechtheion, anybody seen
that in Acropolis, Athens?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.750
You guys travel?

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.620
You got to travel.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.640
It's a bit of a ruin now.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.050
You don't really get
what it seems.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.450
But it's seen as one of the
most sophisticated of

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.070
buildings that the Greeks
had ever produced.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.830
Very complicated building.

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.950
Not a classic temple with
a front and a side.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.040
But actually a very, very sort
of complicated temple, showing

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.220
that the Greeks could actually
produce temples with porches,

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.810
and fronts, and backs,
and this and that.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.360
And such a different
type of complexity.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.360
So it's a building that
shows complexity.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.310
And you can sort of see
these MIT bases.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:57.890
So he takes the bases from one
temporal to show sort of a

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.810
type of architectural mastery
of complexity.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.050
He takes the capitals from
another temple to show Athena,

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.415
and knowledge, and sort
of purity of design.

00:45:07.415 --> 00:45:12.620
Then he takes the Roman idea of
the great vault which holds

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.700
knowledge and the sciences
together and basically makes

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:22.210
that into the message, the
corporate message of MIT that

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.080
gets sort of put
into its front.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.680
So today, of course, we look at
buildings and we don't see

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.600
them as messages.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.980
We just see them as, wow,
I like that, or

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.160
I don't like that.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.670
But this is the great advantage
of what the

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.740
classical world brought while
it was still being used, was

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.065
that you take the pieces and
you can construct arguments

00:45:44.065 --> 00:45:48.560
out of them, depending on how
and what you're referring to.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.350
So this was, in some
sense, a message.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:54.040
And this was why they brought in
Bosworth to, in some sense,

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:58.040
do Freeman's project.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.120
But basically give it the
proper message that

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.350
it needed to have.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.830
And so what you get is really
the best of both worlds, I

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.550
think, is this positioning of
MIT in the corporate world, as

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.870
the corporate progress of world
was understood at that

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:13.670
time-- right-- in the
emerging world.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.020
But also have in its core--
of the inside--

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.360
this sort of fantastic concrete
slab building.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.060
Which was also progressive in
its own right, but it's not

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.500
celebrated in any
particular way.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.170
It's just there--

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.430
right?

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:32.840
And of course, that interior of
the building got repeatedly

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.620
nibbled on and transformed,
and [? resealings ?]

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.480
and new windows and doors.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.400
So it's very hard to see that.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.240
The best places are
the staircase.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.700
Which if you just think, 1913,
these really amazingly clear,

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:54.040
functional concrete staircases
that are so simple, you hardly

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.530
think that that's anything
to be proud of-- right?

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.560
But if you're thinking of what
could have happened-- right?

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.110
Which would have been
a building--

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.150
free standing buildings
in a quad, like

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.020
in the Harvard model.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.600
It would've been a very
different story.

00:47:17.855 --> 00:47:21.790
Yeah, that's the end of my
little spiel here about the

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.420
old building, at least up
until it was built.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:31.830
So, questions?

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.652
Thoughts?

00:47:33.652 --> 00:47:34.103
Yeah?

00:47:34.103 --> 00:47:35.910
AUDIENCE: This is a litle
off-topic, but do you think

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:39.032
the reason why we call Athena
"Athena" has anything to do

00:47:39.032 --> 00:47:40.020
with the architecture?

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.010
Like, the computer system?

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.150
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah,
I don't know.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.790
Could be just coincidence, it
could be just coincidence.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.740
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Interesting.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.860
MARK JARZOMBEK: At one moment,
Boston was seen--

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.420
was trying to define itself as
the Athens on the Charles.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.080
So the ionic columns that
are on our building--

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:07.230
and if you go to the museum,
the Fine Arts

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:10.320
Museum has ionic columns.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.170
Many of the buildings designed
first by MIT, and then during

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.500
the '20s and '30s will
have ionic on them.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.040
Because Boston was sort of
trying to nickname itself as

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:26.120
the Athens of learning and
civilization on the Charles.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.118
So that maybe leaked out.

00:48:30.118 --> 00:48:30.615
Yeah?

00:48:30.615 --> 00:48:34.591
AUDIENCE: Was the Infinite
Corridor planned today, like

00:48:34.591 --> 00:48:37.170
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:37.520
MARK JARZOMBEK: Absolutely.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.320
That's right, yeah.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.065
The corridor was--

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:46.690
corridors were complicated
spaces.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.340
We see them today as
pretty generic.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:55.890
But in those days, corridors
were actually very special

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.190
places used--

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.340
like a novel types of spaces.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.470
Partly, they were rejected
because they didn't have a

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:05.260
good ventilation.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.140
So you needed to have
very, very tall--

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.440
because there's no
air conditioning,

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.640
and there's no heating.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.460
So they would be very cold, and
then in summer if you put

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.430
bathrooms there, the fumes would
collect and they'd be

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:18.200
sort of stinky, maybe-- right?

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.330
So during the 19th century,
you're going to find few

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.810
buildings actually designing
with corridors.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.170
But they start emerging in the
late 19th century in state

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:31.610
houses, parliament buildings,
as representational places.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:33.940
You know when we say someone
is lobbying--

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.910
right-- because the corridor was
next to these lobbies in

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.680
the parliament building.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.680
So the idea that you could
have these corridors--

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.320
places where people
would hang out--

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.400
was seen as a positive thing.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.430
But that's one of the reasons
these spaces and the building

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:51.370
was so huge, is because the idea
was the ventilation, you

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.700
don't have artificial
ventilation.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.280
So the whole building had to
be circulated through these

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.600
windows and through
the corridors.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.350
But yeah, it was designed with
these corridors in mind.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.680
Initially, the idea was that the
offices would have walls

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.430
out of very thin wood, and he
called them curtain walls,

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.090
which is different from the
technical term today in

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:13.540
architecture.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.600
But they were literally like
curtains, so that if the

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.060
physics professor wanted more
space, he could expand or

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.430
something like that.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.210
Of course, that turned out to
be completely dysfunctional,

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:28.150
because you give a professor
space, he's never going to

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:29.776
give it up.

00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:33.080
I mean, now we have the space
wars at MIT, and it's just

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.630
like to death.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.630
We've been trying to move a one
wall between two offices,

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.070
now, for 10 years in Department
of Architecture,

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:43.040
and it's just not
gonna happen.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.080
So this idea that this was like
a free plan, where the

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.850
corridors are the spine and the
stable part of it, and the

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.860
walls are sort of moving and
expanding and contracting as

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:55.390
disciplines.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.075
Because he knew that disciplines
were moving and

00:50:57.075 --> 00:50:57.340
contracting.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.510
So he wanted a building that
was very flexible.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.000
That's why there are no walls.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:01.130
Right?

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.240
Just slab and columns.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:04.660
Right?

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.620
Then the walls are
all in-filled.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.610
Unfortunately, the walls
became permanent,

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:11.860
as all walls do.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.580
So even that would've been--

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.810
the idea of a building with
no walls was just

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.368
unbelievably modern.

00:51:23.368 --> 00:51:25.748
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about the "V's in

00:51:25.748 --> 00:51:28.128
"Massachusetts" on
the building.

00:51:28.128 --> 00:51:30.032
Why "V's" and not "U's?

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.820
MARK JARZOMBEK: That's because
the Romans didn't have "U's"--

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.110
right?

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:40.550
So they were copying the Roman
script, and so Romans didn't

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:43.530
have "U", so everything
was "V".

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.060
So they didn't have--

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.310
it stuck.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.900
AUDIENCE: Do you know anything
about the design or the

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.300
rationale behind the huge tunnel
system that we have

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.365
between all the buildings.

00:51:53.365 --> 00:51:56.460
It seems to be a unique
feature of the campus.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:56.800
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.670
That, I don't know.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.690
Maybe you guys might have
a little bit more

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.140
of a clue on that.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.100
I think it would have came out
just almost accidentally, is

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.568
what I understand, but--

00:52:05.568 --> 00:52:06.940
DAVID MINDELL: I think so, and
then I think that more

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.800
recently it's been explicit that
there's been connections

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.860
between the new buildings.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.140
But that's a good paper
topic for somewhere.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.610
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Yeah,
that is a good topic.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.105
AUDIENCE: There really aren't
that many more basement

00:52:18.105 --> 00:52:21.685
systems rather than just the
regular systems, anyways.

00:52:21.685 --> 00:52:24.370
I mean, there's a couple extra
hallways in the basement.

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:28.390
But in general, the buildings
are connected above ground

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:31.260
just as much as they
are underneath.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.580
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking that
especially the connection

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.330
between Philips 66 and all the
way across the Kendall Square,

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.880
it seemed to be pretty
deliberate to want to do that.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.450
In any case, I heard it was like
the second longest tunnel

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:43.617
system compared to
the Pentagon or

00:52:43.617 --> 00:52:44.345
something like that.

00:52:44.345 --> 00:52:45.800
I might have been [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.600
But it's pretty big.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:48.940
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Interesting.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.010
MARK JARZOMBEK: The whole
building is designed on field

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.510
because, as you know from your
reading, this was all swamp.

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:57.910
And field is not a good place
to design a building on--

00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:58.550
right?

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.320
Because it basically wants
to be a swamp again.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.040
So the engineering of the
building-- basically you have

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.175
design of gigantic, basically,
bathtub slab--

00:53:09.175 --> 00:53:09.460
right?

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.670
And the building sort of sits
in this huge footprint--

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.990
right?

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.310
Sort of sits down and you're--
and so in other words, you

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:18.365
just put a point in and a point
in it'll start leaning

00:53:18.365 --> 00:53:19.030
and tilting-- right?

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.700
So you put a big platform,
and then you can put

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.930
your building on it.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:27.110
So the engineering of this,
actually was hugely

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:27.800
complicated.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.120
Done by a guy called Stone--

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.080
engineering firm Stone, which
was one of the largest

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.040
engineering firms in the
world at the time.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.760
He was also a [? graduate. ?]

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.950
Freeman was so upset when they
hired Bosworth to take his

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:45.640
plan and basically botch it,
that he took his entire

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.640
research and burned it.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.900
And so all that we have left
in the archives are these

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.380
really bad photographs, some
snapshot that someone took of

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.590
some of these sheets
that are left.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:00.490
And they haven't given a cent
to MIT, ever-- right?

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.450
I mean, still today, if you
talk to the Freeman

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.540
[INAUDIBLE] guys, they go, we're
not coming, we're not

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.070
coming, we hate you guys.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:11.850
Because he felt that he had
really studied this thing

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.500
exhaustively, and was going to
give MIT the best building

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.000
that they could possibly
imagine, and was upset that

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.990
MIT then basically went
for Bosworth.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:23.260
And it's a conflict, as I
write about in my book,

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.660
between two different types
of identities--

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:26.020
right?

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.740
I mean, Freeman was a type of
modern person where he wanted

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.830
concrete, he wanted engineering,
he wants building

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:34.990
to be proud of itself as a civil
engineering expression.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:37.070
And he understood that this
was the moment of history

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:40.220
where an institution
could do that.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.330
And so he's sort of right.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:45.450
But there was another type
of modern movement being

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:48.430
developed, which was the
modern corporation.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.820
And MIT was sort of like trying
to figure out which one

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:51.540
do we want-- right?

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:55.860
And ultimately, they opted for
going with the idea that the

00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.900
modern corporation is what an
institution like this is, as

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.460
opposed to a public
institution-- right?

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.370
So it was shifting from a public
institution, which had

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.835
to be humble and small to
a private institution--

00:55:10.835 --> 00:55:12.340
right-- like it is
now-- right?

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.210
With one fell swoop when
Eastman gave the

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:17.580
$10 million, right?

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.940
Boom, it's a private
institution.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.140
So private institutions operate
on very different

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.410
representational models.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.720
So being in the world--

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.110
having an argument about
your position in the

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.320
world was key to that.

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.370
And for that--

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:33.740
only architects at the time
knew how to do that--

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.550
right?

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.210
I don't know if they still know
how to do it, but that

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:38.460
was the point.

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.620
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Was there
a time prior to the

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:50.080
Freeman-Bosworth divide that
architects and engineers

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.230
considered themselves
one in the same?

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:57.550
Or did that never exist?

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:00.080
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yes, probably
in the 1880s, I think

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.860
architecture and engineering
were a lot closer.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.970
Then, engineering
professionalized itself much

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:08.620
earlier than architecture.

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.710
Engineering was already
professionalized practically

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:17.240
in the 1880s, whereas
architecture started to

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.840
professionalize itself
around 1900.

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.020
And even then, many architects
were going, we don't want to

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.900
be professional,
we are artists.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.860
So really, it was only in
the 1940s, really, that

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.250
architecture as a professional
practice really takes root,

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.210
really with the second
World War.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:35.310
So being a professional practice
gave engineers a

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:37.220
powerful leg to stand on.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:41.240
Because they understood
deliverables, they understood

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:45.050
how buildings operate and
function in the real world,

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:48.770
whereas architects could give
you the appearance--

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:50.980
right-- but not know anything
about how to build it.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.390
And that split begins to emerge
around 1900, between

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:59.070
architecture as a design
project, and engineering.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.620
So in other words, when civil
engineering and architecture

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.280
start two different
fields-- right--

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.080
that's when they have
this antagonism.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.150
But because engineers were so
incredibly competent, they

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:15.300
could build buildings
in their sleep.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.850
I mean, sort of dumb
buildings-- right?

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:19.340
So they thought, that's how
you should be building.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.700
So the engineers had something
to argue for themselves.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.560
They make buildings, they knew
how to make them safe, they

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.400
don't burn, they don't do this,
so that's all you need

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.350
to do-- right?

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:32.130
So that antagonism basically
heats up around 1900, and this

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.750
is an example of that.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.480
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Where does
William Ware stand in this?

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.120
Was he an engineer
slash architect?

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.170
Or was he--

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.090
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah, he was
sort of the gentlemen

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:46.810
architect tradition idea.

00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:49.410
So he's the one who founds the
Department of Architecture

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.020
along the gentleman model--

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:51.790
right?

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.500
And, yes, the engineering is
important, but engineering

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.490
still was something that wasn't
too much of a problem

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:00.910
because if you make these types
of buildings, you make

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:05.150
your walls, you put
in some big beams.

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.000
There's not a big question--
right?

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.850
But if you make MIT out of
concrete, in a million square

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:12.170
feet-- and how do you pour it?

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:13.890
How do you--

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.360
on the swampy soil?

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.512
This is an engineering problem
of mega proportions--

00:58:19.512 --> 00:58:20.720
right?

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.520
And this is not for
an architect .

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.710
So architecture in the mid-20th
century was at a

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:27.280
scale that engineering wasn't
a real problem, because most

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.540
of it was just pretty
easy to do.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.090
But as soon as you make big
buildings like this--

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:33.300
MERRIT ROE SMITH:
Different story.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.440
MARK JARZOMBEK: --engineer has
to be really front and center.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.552
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Interesting.

00:58:37.552 --> 00:58:40.450
AUDIENCE: Isn't the divide
between architecture and

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.865
engineering still a big
problem at MIT?

00:58:42.865 --> 00:58:45.119
Because you look at buildings
like the Stata Center, in a

00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:47.695
sense they both have--

00:58:47.695 --> 00:58:51.784
they're both very artistic,
but have a lot

00:58:51.784 --> 00:58:54.312
of structural problems.

00:58:54.312 --> 00:58:58.110
So isn't that still a pretty
modern problem?

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:07.520
MARK JARZOMBEK: Well my uncle,
who is an architect lawyer,

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:11.260
architects come to him to get
them out of lawsuits.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.960
So he always says, there's no
such thing as a building that

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.230
doesn't leak--

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:17.390
rule one-- and there's no such
thing as a good building that

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:19.780
doesn't have a lawsuit.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.365
And so someone's always suing
something because--

00:59:22.365 --> 00:59:23.080
no one knows.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.950
I mean, my windows in
my Building 10,

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:29.260
they leak, I mean.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.750
And they're rusted shut--

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:31.320
the upper one--

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.940
I just like-- you can't
even move it.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.400
Just-- you know.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:35.350
So that's maybe a question of

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.760
maintenance, rather than design.

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.130
But I'm a little bit more
sympathetic to Gary.

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:47.710
I think some of the lawsuit
anxiety is misplaced a bit.

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:50.380
Because most buildings of that
scale are going to have

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:52.160
mistakes and problems.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.660
And anyway, almost every
Gary project gets sued.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.830
You get sued.

00:59:56.830 --> 00:59:58.510
For every building, he's
got a lawsuit.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.585
So when MIT hired him, they
should have known that.

01:00:00.585 --> 01:00:03.435
It's sort of like, don't they
read the newspapers?

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.160
So it's just a little bit
his fault, a little bit

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.440
everybody's fault.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.490
The client should
of known better.

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:15.110
If they're going to get a
building that is designed at

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:17.140
the cutting edge of a certain
type of technological

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.750
revolution, there might be
problems, and so forth.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.060
If they wanted a simpler
building, they shouldn't have

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.650
done it with Gary.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:26.460
That's the point.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.320
DAVID MINDELL: So in the
Bosworth-Freeman story, would

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.456
you describe the main group that
we ended up with as kind

01:00:35.456 --> 01:00:38.920
of a solution that reflects
some anxiety on the

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.180
institute's part?

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.870
Because they voted for--

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:46.310
and as the corporations had some
anxiety, too, trying to

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:50.060
communicate their permanence and
their established nature,

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:53.100
which clearly indicates it's in
question, as we read with

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.850
all the mergers, and all
this sort of stuff?

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:58.890
As opposed to whether Freeman,
or somebody else, pushing

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:02.940
forward light spaces,
international style, very new,

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.450
very cutting edge, but leaving
open the question of whether

01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:09.995
it was really the establishment
or not.

01:01:09.995 --> 01:01:15.505
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah, one of the
points about the book is

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:21.230
that MIT had to learn how to
find it's patronage voice--

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.910
right?

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:25.110
So when they first say, we want
a building, the guy just

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.195
walked down to the store
somewhere to Central Square

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:29.202
and saw someone that said
"architect" and said , oh, can

01:01:29.202 --> 01:01:29.950
you design this for us?

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:30.300
Right?

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.610
They didn't imagine this to be
anything more complicated than

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:39.750
just going out and getting
box of cereal.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:44.920
Then they had to learn that this
was a historical moment.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.860
So they really didn't see
that at the beginning.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.790
They just thought, we just want
a campus and get some

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.220
buildings up.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:56.690
And what Freeman forced him
to do was to slow down and

01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:59.620
understand the historical
moment.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.750
Once they understood historical
moment, in a way

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:03.670
thanks to Freeman--

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:04.450
right--

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.490
they put everything aside and
waited a year or two for him

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.750
to make his research.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.870
They actually thought more about
the historical moment

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.780
than Freeman wanted them to.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.930
Because they said, the moment
isn't just to do a great

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:22.170
factory-style campus.

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.430
The really historical moment
is our new relationship and

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:29.820
identity as a private
institution, dependent on the

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.920
corporate institution.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.265
And so that's the actual
thing we need--

01:02:35.265 --> 01:02:37.920
right?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.600
So they had to learn how to find
that, thanks to Freeman.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.870
But actually, thanks
to Freeman, then

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.610
they went past Freeman--

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.210
right--

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:48.480
and articulated a different
project.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.160
It was a huge spectacle.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.780
It was a age where a vast public
spectacle-- this one,

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.780
the early 20th century--

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.490
where something happened that
you could do these things.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:05.110
So yeah, there was a searchlight
on top of the

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.560
Rogers building, and there's
a searchlight on top of MIT

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.940
building-- the Dome.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.640
And they got these from some
Navy frigate that was out in

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.380
the dock harbor-- they borrowed
the searchlights.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:19.310
And then everybody left the
procession down from the

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:20.570
Rogers building to the dock.

01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:22.540
And then there was a special
boat, and they all

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.890
piled on to the boat.

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:26.930
And the boat almost sank
because no one had ever

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:31.010
bothered to figure out what
800 people weigh.

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:32.010
And that would have
been interesting--

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.410
right?

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:34.537
It would have been a very
different story today about

01:03:34.537 --> 01:03:37.459
the death of the faculty--

01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:40.000
MERRIT ROE SMITH: The charter
sinks into the Charles.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.660
MARK JARZOMBEK: Students dying
and swimming and--

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.885
DAVID MINDELL: I've heard that
that building's actually in

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:43.620
the Charles.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.880
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Yeah, that's
what I've heard, too.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.407
DAVID MINDELL: Does anybody know
where you walk by that

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:49.140
boat everyday?

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.640
Where you see it everyday?

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.640
There's a huge picture of it
right at the end of the

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.970
Infinite Corridor, right
here on this wall.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:56.946
I just walked by it
this morning.

01:03:56.946 --> 01:04:02.426
And it was also the last one in
this whole little collage

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.823
about that set of events.

01:04:04.823 --> 01:04:07.060
MARK JARZOMBEK: And then they
got on the boat and they went

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.050
off to the dock.

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.820
MIT was supposed to have
a dock, which was

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.840
never actually built.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.640
And then they all got out.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.800
And then every student was
participating, in one way or

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:23.110
other, in an opera that was
custom designed called--

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:23.860
what was the name of this?

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.250
I can't remember--

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:28.690
The Grey World, or something
like that, which featured the

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.260
history of the world
with MIT at the

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.336
culminating piece of that.

01:04:34.336 --> 01:04:34.820
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Of course.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.720
MARK JARZOMBEK: And it featured
this woman called

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.890
Tanner, who was this great
swirly, dirly--

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:47.950
not wearing many clothes and
illuminated with red and

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.345
purple and orange lights
down below.

01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:54.120
It was one of the great first
light show events--

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:54.350
right?

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.900
They would take with lights
going off and on [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.480
But this was one of the
first experiments in

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.860
colored light shows.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.520
And Tanner did her
swirly dance.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.770
And then the big opera came.

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:06.790
And the music came.

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:08.530
And Rockefeller gave a speech.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.860
And everybody gave speeches.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.410
And da, da, da, da.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:15.310
And Cram, who was the head of
the department, was the master

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:15.780
of ceremonies.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:18.680
And then he opened the door.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:26.090
And then the two searchlights
were touching, like this.

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:27.070
And then when you open
the door, the

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:29.880
searchlights went like that.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.100
And the MIT-Roger Williams
searchlight cut off, and you

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.872
only had MIT searchlight on.

01:05:34.872 --> 01:05:37.900
And so that was the great,
heroic moment.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.000
I mean, you could imagine
it was spectacular.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.780
But it was all at night, so
there's only one photograph

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.550
that someone drew in to show a
little bit what it was like.

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.390
But you couldn't photograph
any of that stuff.

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:50.960
MARK JARZOMBEK: The Rogers
building was used until--

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.150
it was only torn down the '20s,
or even later-- right?

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.180
In the 30--

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.100
DAVID MINDELL: The main group
was built in one big swoop

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.200
that was that time.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.440
But then there were various
other pieces filled in until

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.680
the end of the '20s-- right?

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.030
It wasn't really complete
until around 1930--

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:07.770
MARK JARZOMBEK: That's right.

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:10.006
DAVID MINDELL: --when the last
of all what we now know as

01:06:10.006 --> 01:06:10.410
[INAUDIBLE].

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.451
So if you look at them, they
look a little different

01:06:12.451 --> 01:06:13.393
[INAUDIBLE].

01:06:13.393 --> 01:06:14.335
MARK JARZOMBEK: That's
right, yeah.

01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:15.280
That's right.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.090
I mean, I. M. Pei, who
studied here--

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:18.610
DAVID MINDELL: [INAUDIBLE]
stayed over [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.100
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah, see
architecture is over there, so

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.680
I. M. Pei, who studied here when
he was here in the '40s--

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.800
he was in the Rogers
building, still.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.090
He was like the last student
to use that building .

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
MIT building for--

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.550
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah, it was
still-- they rented it, the

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:35.800
various floors at that time.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.870
Then, sadly, it was torn down.

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:42.050
MERRIT ROE SMITH: That's
interesting.

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:43.690
MARK JARZOMBEK: Well, there's
sort of a playfulness about

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:47.960
it, which I think
one has love.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.460
MIT had this incredible--

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.720
you read, also, the skits that
were being performed.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.180
MIT had this tradition of
skits and theater skits.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.160
And in the yearbook you see
these guys will be dressed up

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.870
as god knows what.

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:06.333
And they make some skit
imitating some professors or

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:07.640
doing [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.440
We lost all that.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.970
I mean, somewhere MIT became
very serious, and all that

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:17.220
playful skits and irony
just went somewhere.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.450
I don't know where.

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.085
MERRIT ROE SMITH: It went
to the students.

01:07:20.085 --> 01:07:21.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:21.790
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Isn't
that what you were

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:22.810
saying in your paper?

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:26.669
AUDIENCE: I feel like it's still
around, maybe on the

01:07:26.669 --> 01:07:27.730
undergraduate level.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:32.466
But I feel like MIT is a more
unique place than the other

01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:34.826
college campus, just because
of some of the

01:07:34.826 --> 01:07:36.076
weird stuff we do here.

01:07:38.927 --> 01:07:41.909
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Yeah,
good point.

01:07:41.909 --> 01:07:43.897
DAVID MINDELL: But I think
your point is right.

01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:47.260
The spectacle of that
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.190
was a moment in time when--

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.740
who knows what?

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.272
There was enough technology
to bring a lot of people

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:57.961
together, but people weren't
yet jaded by radio and

01:07:57.961 --> 01:07:58.695
television.

01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:01.629
Where they wouldn't put all of
their effort in to that thing.

01:08:01.629 --> 01:08:08.770
The allegories and all of the
performances was something we

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.730
studied a lot with the 150th.

01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:14.790
And try to figure out what parts
of it are repeatable and

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:15.894
what parts--

01:08:15.894 --> 01:08:16.388
MARK JARZOMBEK: --are goofy.

01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:17.638
DAVID MINDELL: --are not.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.270
MERRIT ROE SMITH: So I take
it, that's not going to be

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:24.580
repeated this spring.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.288
DAVID MINDELL: Well, Professor
Smith is going to dress up as

01:08:25.288 --> 01:08:26.468
Merlin for [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:26.468 --> 01:08:29.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.210
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Well, if you
do-- if you dare do something

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.870
like that, David,
I'll be Merlin.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:38.850
I don't think you dare do it.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:41.800
DAVID MINDELL: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.950
MIT charter in it.

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:43.580
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Oh yeah.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.659
DAVID MINDELL: Across the river,
almost like Raiders of

01:08:46.659 --> 01:08:49.705
the Lost Ark.

01:08:49.705 --> 01:08:51.130
MERRIT ROE SMITH: Wasn't the--

01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:53.500
it was like a Venetian
galley, wasn't it?

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.160
That was built to carry the
stuff across the river?

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.410
MARK JARZOMBEK: That's right,
the Venetian was a theme.

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.970
MERRIT ROE SMITH: And it was
built up in Gloucester or

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:01.520
somewhere, and they had to bring
it down along the coast.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.170
MARK JARZOMBEK:That's right.

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:04.560
MERRIT ROE SMITH: And I think
it's in your book, that you

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.220
talk about how it got damaged
on the way, or something.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.010
And they were worried
about it sinking.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.499
MARK JARZOMBEK: Well, they were
worried about it sinking

01:09:10.499 --> 01:09:12.609
because they'd never really
thought about people in it.

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:14.819
And they'd never tested it.

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:17.149
I mean, it's just a barge,
dressed up with all

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:18.086
that stuff on it.

01:09:18.086 --> 01:09:19.336
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.852
AUDIENCE: When we go to the MIT
Museum, Debbie Douglas has

01:09:23.852 --> 01:09:26.250
a piece of that, a piece
of the plaster.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:26.790
MARK JARZOMBEK: Oh, really?

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:27.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:28.100
AUDIENCE: Really?

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:28.660
Oh, interesting.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.390
AUDIENCE: And she tells
me that it's still out

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:31.223
there on the river.

01:09:31.223 --> 01:09:34.128
And maybe we'll drag sonar
around and see

01:09:34.128 --> 01:09:34.962
if we can find it.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:39.040
AUDIENCE: Well, get that
side-scan sonar.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.834
He's an expert on this stuff.

01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:42.292
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah,
let's go find it.

01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:44.460
Yeah, it was a great
moment for MIT.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.240
There's no doubt.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.609
[? Elliot ?] was at
the ceremony.

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:47.600
AUDIENCE: Was he really?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.674
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah.

01:09:49.674 --> 01:09:51.050
But, I mean, you could--

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:53.970
they were just clearly
probably chafing

01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.304
at the bit on this.

01:09:56.304 --> 01:09:57.370
It was a huge [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:59.460
And it was a great
moment for MIT.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.810
The reality was they were
practically bankrupt again.

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.110
Because they had this
great building.

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:07.320
But the building was vastly
over-expensive, by more

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.100
expensive than the
10 millions.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.520
And so Eastman kept on
dishing out millions

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.910
and millions millions.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.150
And you got to remember, 10
million back then, I mean,

01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:19.570
it's not 10 million even
[INAUDIBLE] today.

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:20.950
But you probably have
to add a zero.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:24.870
So it's something like 100
million, which is a huge

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:30.160
amount as a single gift to
create a building like this.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.280
I mean, it's like an
unbelievable event in the

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.540
history of philanthropy.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.840
American philanthropy is just
one of these great, marvelous

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.140
inventions.

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.725
I mean, one can think
about capitalism in

01:10:40.725 --> 01:10:41.460
all sorts of ways.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.620
But you go around the world
and capitalism does not

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.935
produce philanthropy like it
ever did in the America sense.

01:10:46.935 --> 01:10:50.880
And this is one of the great
moments of that.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.670
AUDIENCE: That's interesting.

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:54.670
AUDIENCE: It said that he's
been donating money as

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:55.170
[INAUDIBLE].

01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:56.170
MARK JARZOMBEK: I'm sorry?

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.170
AUDIENCE: He was known
as Mr. Smith.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:59.022
And he didn't want
to be known.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:01.914
So when did he--

01:11:01.914 --> 01:11:02.878
MARK JARZOMBEK: When
did he come out?

01:11:02.878 --> 01:11:04.806
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when did he
tell everybody that he was

01:11:04.806 --> 01:11:05.300
[INAUDIBLE].

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:10.260
MARK JARZOMBEK: It came out, I
think, when Maclaurin died.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:16.190
I think he leaked it out.

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:19.320
I mean, the whole thing
killed Maclaurin.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.810
I mean, it made him
age overnight.

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:27.060
And within a few years,
he was dead.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:32.060
I mean it's just astonishing,
they type of effort it takes,

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.121
the human and human cost,
to [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:37.121 --> 01:11:39.252
AUDIENCE: It's in the Prescott
book, but not on the part that

01:11:39.252 --> 01:11:42.860
was assigned, I think, where
they revealed the identity of

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.360
Eastman, with Eastman's
permission, once the whole

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.420
thing was done at a
reception for the

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.570
corporation at Gray House.

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:53.615
And Maclaurin basically went
upstairs and keeled over and

01:11:53.615 --> 01:11:59.130
died at the reception at
the president's house.

01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:00.690
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:03.095
AUDIENCE: Up in their
apartment's where [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:03.095 --> 01:12:11.320
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] killed
a lot of presidents.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.790
AUDIENCE: Somebody had a
question in their reflection

01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:25.870
about why did Eastman give
the money to MIT.

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:28.110
He was not an MIT graduate.

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.102
Who asked that question?

01:12:30.102 --> 01:12:32.592
Somebody did.

01:12:32.592 --> 01:12:33.820
No?

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.860
Am I think--

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.590
boy, I'm having a
bad day here.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:37.090
Pardon?

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:39.140
AUDIENCE: --was why he
gave it anonymously.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.850
Why?

01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:44.680
Does anyone know?

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.930
MARK JARZOMBEK: I don't know.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.830
AUDIENCE: Because I think in
Prescott's book, when MIT was

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:58.150
Boston Tech, isn't he the one
that says the reason why

01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:00.550
Eastman gave the money was that
it had to do with the

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:04.870
fact that he employed a lot
of MIT graduates and was

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:05.780
impressed by them.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.850
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.000
But why he remained anonymous,
I have no idea.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.350
AUDIENCE: Eastman was
a strange guy too.

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:12.240
AUDIENCE: Was he?

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.645
AUDIENCE: He was dead by suicide
within a few years

01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:20.650
after all this happened
anyway, I've heard.

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:24.010
I've never seen any
evidence for this.

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:27.210
It's also interesting to look at
was that one of the sources

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:34.840
of MIT's big impact in 20th
century industry was that they

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.070
were so broke after they built
the buildings that they

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:41.080
basically laid off the faculty
one day a week and encouraged

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.510
them to make up their incomes
by consulting.

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.410
And it's still true today that
the faculty are allowed to

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:48.215
consult one day a week.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:51.890
And that, born as a
budget-cutting measure,

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:55.610
actually ended up doing a lot
to diffuse MIT's technology

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:56.460
into [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.340
AUDIENCE: Wow.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:00.238
Cool.

01:14:00.238 --> 01:14:01.687
AUDIENCE: But I've only
heard that as a story.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.110
I've never actually seen any
documents about that.

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:08.150
AUDIENCE: Well, I know that in
the School of Engineering, not

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:11.210
in the School of Humanities
and Social Sciences, as

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:16.850
recently as 1980, assistant
professors were required to

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:20.210
raise I think it was
50% of their salary

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.180
through outside grants.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.070
And associate professors had to
raise a certain percentage.

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:27.330
And even full professors,
although it was a small

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:29.150
percentage at that point.

01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:33.610
And that ended basically when
they started to go--

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:36.580
well, convert over
to a more endowed

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.340
professorships, things like that.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:44.220
It was during a fund-raising
venture in the 1990s perhaps.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:47.290
So that's lasted.

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:49.320
AUDIENCE: Do you think MIT's
relationship to it's

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.595
architecture has stayed
the same?

01:14:50.595 --> 01:14:54.876
Or how has it changed
since 1960?

01:14:54.876 --> 01:14:56.260
A lot has been said in
the last ten years.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.400
MARK JARZOMBEK: As you point
out, MIT, so much went into

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.863
the main building that basically
the rest of the

01:15:01.863 --> 01:15:03.750
campus, apart from the
president's house, the

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:06.265
dormitory [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:06.265 --> 01:15:08.520
just didn't really get built.

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.450
So that, I mean, for better or
for worse, I don't know.

01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:16.290
But the dormitory section was
going to be behind Walker,

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:17.258
that whole area.

01:15:17.258 --> 01:15:20.162
And eventually they built those
two dorms back there.

01:15:20.162 --> 01:15:21.620
But they're absolutely
nothing like what

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.680
Bosworth had really planned.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:27.930
He planned a whole little sort
of community back there.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:31.430
So that opened up sort
of this territorial

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:35.310
problem about expansion.

01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:41.280
So the idea of a mega building
expanding but always be one

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.260
building then also went against
the modernist ethos of

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:48.180
free-standing great buildings
and so forth.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:51.240
So you had the library
building,

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.610
which is a lovely building.

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:56.050
It's '51 or something
like that.

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.590
But that was supposed
to be the library.

01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:02.160
Then where the music hall was
is a little student center.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.550
AUDIENCE: Which building
is this?

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:06.730
MARK JARZOMBEK: The
Hayden Library.

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:07.000
That's right.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.675
So there's a courtyard.

01:16:07.675 --> 01:16:10.220
And the courtyard belonged to
the little student center.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.480
So where the music library is
would be the student center.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.540
The doors would open up.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:18.890
And at night you could have
social life and then

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:19.360
professors.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.190
So it was professors,
books, and students.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:24.000
It was a whole little island.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.120
Well, that lasted for all
of five or six years.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.780
And then the library
wanted more space.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.915
And the professors wanted
more space.

01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:34.310
And to hell with the
student life.

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:35.980
So they got rid of those.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.240
So the courtyard died.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.500
And now no one goes into
the courtyard.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.920
And it's sort of sad.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.200
You know, they put some
statues in there.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:44.780
But that was [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:45.300
experiment.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.770
But it was exactly an
anti-Bosworth world.

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:53.540
Let's build a building like a
little enclave as opposed to

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.880
this sort of connected tissue.

01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:01.340
So that was the beginning of
sort of the mistakes, I think,

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.920
that the campus eventually
made.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.270
Then they built these buildings
which sort of

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:07.590
continue it but don't
really continue.

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:10.910
Whereas these buildings were
designed, obviously, in

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:15.290
continuation of the courtyard
to some degree.

01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:18.600
And I do like these
buildings better.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:23.850
But basically this part of the
campus just got fizzled up and

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:27.960
chewed up with discontinuous
buildings.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.806
The worst building of them all
is building nine on Mass Ave,

01:17:32.806 --> 01:17:35.120
designed by Skidmore,
Owings, and Merrill.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.020
So you know which one.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.910
You have the steps going
up to your left.

01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:39.150
It's sort of a modern thing.

01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:40.800
AUDIENCE: It's also,
like, connected--

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.300
MARK JARZOMBEK: And it
completely disconnected.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.140
AUDIENCE: No--

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.680
MARK JARZOMBEK: It's connected,
but not on the

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:45.420
third floor.

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.740
And the fourth floor, you've
got to go down some steps.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.920
Because they wanted to put five
floors in the space of

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.370
three floors.

01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:51.756
AUDIENCE: It didn't used
to be that way.

01:17:51.756 --> 01:17:53.142
That happened with
the library.

01:17:53.142 --> 01:17:54.530
It used to be connected.

01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:55.740
MARK JARZOMBEK: That's right.

01:17:55.740 --> 01:18:00.180
So the idea of these giant
floors and ceilings was a big

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.260
problem for these modern
buildings because by this time

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:02.855
we had ventilation.

01:18:02.855 --> 01:18:07.400
And we don't need to have
12-foot, 20-foot floors.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.510
You want 8-foot, 9-foot, and
then you're done with it.

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.280
So you can pack much more floor
space that you could in

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.490
these older buildings.

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.650
But it means, of course, that
you're going to ruin any kind

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.070
of continuity of that.

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.940
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.580
MARK JARZOMBEK: And then they
refurbished these buildings.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.200
They weren't too bad.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:31.550
The skins of these buildings
used to be orange and yellow,

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:32.580
which I thought was
really lovely.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.820
And then they painted it this
sort of blah, MIT blah--

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:38.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:39.440
MARK JARZOMBEK: I don't
know, white.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.280
Not white, it's sort
of beige, beige-y.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.870
They painted everything, just
sort of toned everything down

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.210
when they did the big
restoration of these

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:48.510
buildings, which I think
is really sad.

01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:53.640
But yeah, I mean, it
was a problem.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:59.390
I mean, campus design in the
beginning of the '40s through

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:02.780
the war, after the war, into
'70s, was basically big,

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.330
chunky buildings.

01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:06.440
And this went against-- and it
was great for everywhere else.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.790
It was great for
other campuses,

01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:08.860
which had big spaces.

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:09.850
You could put a big
chunky building.

01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:12.980
So we got our student center,
which is the big, ugly chunky

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.950
building designed by the
former dean of MIT.

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:19.570
So that's how you design
buildings.

01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:23.540
And this idea of these sort of
continual flow buildings,

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:26.870
open-ended spaces just wasn't
going to happen.

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.930
And the Gehry building
tries to return a

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:29.480
little bit to that.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.680
I mean, that's the great
thing about it.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:38.030
It tries to actually re-envision
a world where you

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:44.265
can go into space and there's
some flexibility of ownership

01:19:44.265 --> 01:19:45.515
to some degree.

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:51.850
AUDIENCE: The student center
and the Dewey Library,

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:56.050
Political Science Building
remind me of--

01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:58.140
I don't know if they were
designed by the same person.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.690
But were they built during
the Vietnam War period?

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:02.050
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah.

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:02.470
Well, '68.

01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:03.760
AUDIENCE: They remind me
of being-- they're

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.890
like frontier garrisons.

01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:11.200
They're like stockades, and
walled-off, and very

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.550
defensible looking.

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:13.260
MARK JARZOMBEK: You
can date these

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.810
buildings 1968 to '72 usually.

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.700
The University's basically
decided students are bad.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.840
We're going to make buildings
that look like fortresses--

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.550
they're made out of concrete--
that they can't ruin, destroy,

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:26.580
beat up, or do anything with.

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.700
The student center
has a certain

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:31.370
elegance to it's design.

01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:34.750
And look at it at night, it's
actually quite spectacular.

01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:37.490
But basically it is a fortress,
I mean, literally.

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:40.440
It's got the shooting
arrows up there.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.250
MARK JARZOMBEK: I mean,
[MAKES SHOOTING NOISES].

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.110
Like, what kind of a message
does that send?

01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:48.080
I mean, that is like not good.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.940
But every university
in America has one.

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:55.186
This is very popular among-- you
know, the administrators

01:20:55.186 --> 01:20:58.312
want mean-looking buildings.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:01.276
AUDIENCE: Why do the interesting
buildings like

01:21:01.276 --> 01:21:05.228
Kresge, which is kind of not
normal, and the chapel, and

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:07.210
the Stata Center [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:08.230
MARK JARZOMBEK: In the '50s.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:12.860
And after the '50s, MIT
had this process--

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:15.270
you might know more about it--

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.990
the new man type thing.

01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:19.990
Which they were afraid that MIT
students were going to be

01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:21.880
too engineering oriented.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.630
And they wanted MIT students
to have culture, so be

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:28.190
cultural representatives.

01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:33.310
So the idea of the Kresge
Auditorium was where

01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.370
symphonies could be held.

01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:35.700
And people could
learn something

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:39.020
about symphonies, music.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.400
And the nondenominational chapel
was a place where we

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:42.970
sort of think.

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:45.263
You know, after the war, and
after the atom bomb, MIT felt

01:21:45.263 --> 01:21:48.300
a little guilty about
all that stuff.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.330
So this was where we're
going to try to heal.

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:54.080
And so we need scientists who
are healing agents and who are

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.890
sophisticated people, not just
going to go out and make bombs

01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:58.510
and whatever.

01:21:58.510 --> 01:22:03.010
So this was part
of that thing.

01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:06.150
Yeah, so that was a very
sliver of a moment.

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:10.580
And that's when the [INAUDIBLE]
gets formed.

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:17.160
So it's part of the emergence
of humanities departments.

01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:27.470
AUDIENCE: I loved what you said
in your lecture when you

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.900
were describing the emergence
of different

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.480
schools, 1873, 1900.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.220
You said--

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.760
I don't know if you purposely
said it, but you said it.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.750
And you said here we see
modernity being formed.

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:42.774
I thought that is a very
interesting comment.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.090
To see these departments
changing and shifting, that's

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.860
a very interesting comment.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.050
AUDIENCE: Another good student
project would be to make a

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:59.520
family tree of the MIT
department's over time.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.610
People have done these trees
with other kinds

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.240
of knowledge systems.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.607
And sort of show how each
department either morphed or

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.650
got substituted over
time coming down.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:12.190
Because we talked a lot about
or a little bit about that

01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:12.680
[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.130
AUDIENCE: This was actually
something I found online.

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:21.010
The San Diego Club of MIT
has a list of all of the

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:23.460
departments course numbers
corresponding

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.420
with things in history.

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:28.610
AUDIENCE: How do you find it?

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:30.310
Do you just Google it?

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:31.780
AUDIENCE: I can send
it to you.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah, great.

01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:35.270
MARK JARZOMBEK: Yeah, the point
is to understand that

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:37.815
all these shifts reflect things
that are happening in

01:23:37.815 --> 01:23:39.690
the outside world.

01:23:39.690 --> 01:23:44.330
So in what way does this map,
which is what this is, give us

01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:46.170
the topography of the world?

01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:50.740
We don't see what's happening
in the outside world.

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:54.150
I can't remember when it was,
but in 1943 there's a

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:56.230
psychology department.

01:23:56.230 --> 01:23:57.625
And it lasts about 10 years.

01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:59.946
And then it disappears.

01:23:59.946 --> 01:24:01.230
And you sort of scratch
your head.

01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:02.745
You know, what was that about?

01:24:02.745 --> 01:24:06.760
Well, a lot to do with
military psychology.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.490
And things like that.

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:11.160
So all of the shifting
signifiers of these

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.680
departments are really sort of
traces of energies that are

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.780
taking place.

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:21.295
And MIT, in an odd way, is
really-- you know, something

01:24:21.295 --> 01:24:23.720
could happen and you
can sort of see it.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.340
I mean, it doesn't take 20 years
or 30 years for these

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:26.990
departments.

01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:30.510
What's beautiful about [? MIT ?]
is the really rapid

01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:32.370
elasticity of these departments

01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:34.540
in coming and going.

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:39.320
So in the 1880s, when it was
the great evolution, if you

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.040
will, of the idea of a
professional class--

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.390
it happened very rapidly in the
1880s, the emergence of a

01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:49.810
professional class, politically,
in so many ways--

01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:52.290
you just sort of see
that in the MIT

01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:55.470
departmental structure.

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:57.670
From a gentlemanly class to a
professional class, and it

01:24:57.670 --> 01:25:00.760
just happens right there.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:05.130
And all of these changes are
mapping these forces.

01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:08.920
And it's a great way, it would
be certainly a great thesis to

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.670
use that as indicators.

01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:13.100
AUDIENCE: It would
be, definitely.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:15.773
AUDIENCE: When did people start
referring to the courses

01:25:15.773 --> 01:25:17.960
by their number?

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.632
So, like, was it confusing for
a while when they were making

01:25:20.632 --> 01:25:21.362
all these changes?

01:25:21.362 --> 01:25:24.278
Or did no one say, like,
oh, [INAUDIBLE]

01:25:24.278 --> 01:25:26.222
use that terminology?

01:25:26.222 --> 01:25:26.708
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:28.680
AUDIENCE: Good question.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.250
Debbie Douglas, when she comes,
we should ask her.

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:34.250
Because I know she has a
particular way of thinking

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:35.240
about that.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.480
There are lots of suppositions,
I guess.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.540
And I don't know that anyone
has the answer.

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.800
But she has some pretty
interesting things to say

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.400
about how the numbering
system came about.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.750
AUDIENCE: Anybody hear of the
Engineering Systems Division?

01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:50.640
It's a big thing on
campus today.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.260
And I've been very involved
with them.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:56.221
And 10 years ago when it was
just forming, we used to have

01:25:56.221 --> 01:26:00.000
these off-campus retreats a
couple times a year to talk

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.380
about what this department or
division was going to be.

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.040
And it was sort of a lot
of hand-wringing.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.520
But there were people in the
room from six or eight

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.250
different schools of engineering
and the management

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:15.090
school and humanities and all
kinds of different places, and

01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:16.210
they were all talking
together.

01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:19.590
And at the time, MIT had a big
relationship with Cambridge

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:20.805
University in the UK.

01:26:20.805 --> 01:26:22.610
Still have a little
bit of that, the

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:23.920
Cambridge MIT Institute.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.220
And there were a couple
of guests there

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.910
one year from Cambridge.

01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:30.360
And we spent a whole day sort
of with this kind of

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.610
conversation, and a little
bit anxious about

01:26:32.610 --> 01:26:33.520
what's it going to be?

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.605
How's it going to
define itself?

01:26:34.605 --> 01:26:35.700
Where are all these people?

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.340
And at the end of the day, the
people from Cambridge raised

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.540
their hand and they said, I
just have to tell you, as

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.820
worried as you all are about how
you're going to make this

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.100
thing work, from where
we come from it looks

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.640
just totally amazing.

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.440
Because at Cambridge, a
department gets formed.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.400
And then for 600 years nobody
talks to anybody else in any

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:54.512
of the other departments.

01:26:54.512 --> 01:26:56.770
And you can't even get people
in the same room together to

01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:57.725
talk about this issue.

01:26:57.725 --> 01:26:59.720
And here there are people from
ten different departments

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.150
talking about this.

01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:03.210
And that was just one of those
moments that sort of puts into

01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:05.810
relief what's so fluid
about this place.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.220
MARK JARZOMBEK: I mean,
civil engineering is

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:18.300
now subsumed, right?

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.162
What happened to civil
engineering?

01:27:20.162 --> 01:27:20.890
It's one.

01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:22.840
It's still one?

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think it is.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.030
I was going to--

01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:31.940
I wanted to say something
about I call it boundary

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:34.530
crossing that takes
place here at MIT.

01:27:34.530 --> 01:27:38.830
It has surely picked up here
in the last 10 years.

01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:42.270
I mean, you see it when
students that major in

01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:46.280
mechanical engineering end up
doing what I would identify as

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:46.870
electrical engineering.

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.260
You know, there's just
lots of crossing

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.330
over in research groups.

01:27:51.330 --> 01:27:56.900
And had that existed
since when?

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.530
Were there more--

01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:03.270
there must have been stricter
disciplinary divides between

01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:06.800
these departments as you
go back in time.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.250
But I don't know exactly when
do you identify the end of

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:15.060
that and the beginning of more
of these interdisciplinary

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:15.476
collaborations?

01:28:15.476 --> 01:28:18.350
Is it World War II,
[? NORAD ?] lab or

01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:19.524
something like that?

01:28:19.524 --> 01:28:22.590
AUDIENCE: I mean, I saw, like,
in the MIT Museum, that little

01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:24.826
place where they
had like the--

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:30.760
something about, like,
electrical engineering and

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.710
basically or Psychology.

01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:35.988
So that was in the 1940s.

01:28:35.988 --> 01:28:39.342
And they show up as one of the
first interdisciplinary

01:28:39.342 --> 01:28:42.110
projects at MIT where they
combined electrical

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:46.764
engineering and, like,
proto-computers.

01:28:46.764 --> 01:28:50.469
AUDIENCE: So it's World
War II-ish anyway.

01:28:50.469 --> 01:28:53.400
AUDIENCE: I think it also
relates to, like you saw from

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.950
Mark's chart, if you're talking
about English, and

01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:59.600
history, and law, and theology,
you really do have

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.570
these 600-year traditions.

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:05.670
But beginning with the sciences
and certainly in

01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:10.680
engineering, there's no field
of engineering that's older

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.290
than 200 years.

01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:14.110
And most of them are less
than 100 years old.

01:29:14.110 --> 01:29:18.290
So any time you're in that
game-- and the same is true,

01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:20.210
to some degree, of
the sciences--

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:22.310
and things are professionalizing
over the

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:23.630
course of--

01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:25.310
the boundaries are not
particularly hard.

01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:28.171
I mean, electrical engineering
is this funny combination of

01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:31.130
physics and other kinds
of engineering that

01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:32.460
comes out in the 1880s.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.360
And computer science, that's
also a strange hybrid of

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.350
psychology, and mathematics,
and electrical engineering.

01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:45.280
So at any given point, the
disciplines that we have in a

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.910
technical school are only ever
going to be 40 or 50 years old

01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:50.100
in a certain way.

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.040
AUDIENCE: But it seems to have
really increased in the last

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.080
15 years or so around
here anyway.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.500
There's a lot going on.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.960
AUDIENCE: Well, I think when Roz
Williams comes in, she'll

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.680
talk about the sort of anxieties
about are the

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.830
engineering disciplines worth
anything at all anymore.

01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:08.960
I actually think they are.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.130
But that's another
conversation.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:17.100
MARK JARZOMBEK: Well,
engineering strikes me, from

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.850
the architect, as going downhill
in the United States,

01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:19.990
going uphill in Europe.

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:23.090
I don't know why there's
a bit difference.

01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:26.760
But the crossover issue, I
think, at MIT is, I mean, when

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.110
I leave my office, I pass
a colleague's office.

01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:32.200
I pass the skin lab.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.520
I don't know what the hell
goes on in there.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.690
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:37.190
MARK JARZOMBEK: That's where,
someone told me, they invented

01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:40.100
artificial skin.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.820
And then I pass a lab that built
a room with a lot of

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:45.340
nitrogen tanks sticking
out in the hall.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.090
I don't know what the
hell is in there.

01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:50.740
Then I pass a part
of a library.

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:54.810
Then I pass a student center.

01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:59.080
I mean, if I go from my office
to the dean's office, down the

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.870
hall, I'm walking past three
or four departments who own

01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:05.370
bits and pieces of
this landscape.

01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:07.150
And it's very irritating.

01:31:07.150 --> 01:31:10.230
Because to us, in the dean's
office, we're going God.

01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:12.770
I mean why do we have to walk
all the way around.

01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:15.080
But on the other hand,
it's very MIT.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.540
This sort of odd, gerrymandering
of space that

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:23.980
we have, as frustrating as it
is, is actually interesting.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.880
It's sort of unique.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.380
You can go to Harvard to the
architecture school.

01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:30.830
And there are only a whole
building filled with

01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:32.180
architects.

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.750
I'm not going to see people
making skin lab or see big

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:38.460
hydrogen tanks sitting out in
the hallway with smoke coming

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.710
out of them.

01:31:42.370 --> 01:31:46.450
And I think that this is part
of MIT culture and should be

01:31:46.450 --> 01:31:46.980
maintained.

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I agree.

01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:50.205
It makes it interesting.

01:31:50.205 --> 01:31:53.040
AUDIENCE: OK, on that note,
I think we can--

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:53.560
MARK JARZOMBEK: All
right, guys.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank
you very much.

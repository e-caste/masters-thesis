WEBVTT

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.690
Mujtaba: Today, we're going
to learn about Ohm's Law.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.083
Mujtaba: I'm curious how
many of you have heard of

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.780
or know about Ohm's Law?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.309
Student: I know.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.630
Student: I do.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.390
Student: I've yeah, yeah.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.090
I've heard about it.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.590
Yeah.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.671
Mujtaba: So the simplest way it
is represented is V equals IR.

00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:30.461
That is, the voltage drop,
or the potential drop

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:33.389
across a resistor
in this case is

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:36.418
just the current that
passes through the resistor

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:37.357
times its current.

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.520
So if we were to draw a resistor
right here with a value R,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.682
and this is the current,
then the voltage drop

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:53.437
across this resistor, this V
is equal to the current times

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:58.250
that resistor value that the
resistor has so the resistance

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.414
value of the resistor
and the current path

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:01.496
that passes through it.

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:07.166
Current is the flow of electrons
and V is the potential.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:12.409
So think of it as a
force essentially,

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.542
that allows or enables
these electrons

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:19.187
to move from an area
of higher potential

00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:21.010
to low lower potential.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.521
So if you guys have drunk
boba bubble tea before,

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:29.130
what happens is in
the cup, you guys

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.060
have these bubbles
at the bottom.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.276
And when you try to at
the end, once you're

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:37.567
done with your
drink, you're trying

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:40.875
to suck these bubbles up.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:46.479
The when you're trying
to suck these bubbles out

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.882
of this straw, the pressure
that you're putting on to it

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:51.912
is essentially analogous
to this voltage

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.221
and the flow of these
bubbles in this straw

00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.170
is essentially like the
current and the resistance

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.870
is essentially the friction of
these bubbles with this straw.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.228
And that is the
pressure you will

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:06.816
need to overcome the
flow of these bubbles

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:09.853
in this straw against this
friction to to get it.

00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:11.597
This is essentially
analogous to that.

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.138
So what we're doing
is essentially this.

00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:16.315
Oh, sorry about that.

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:19.581
This concept is
pretty much described

00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.706
in almost every high school
and high school physics

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:25.441
and early college physics.

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:30.528
But a lot of people have a hard
time using this in real life.

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:36.920
So one of the ways we can use it
is if we have a simple circuit.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.986
Mujtaba: So if we
have a simple circuit,

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:45.280
and we have an LED here.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.317
Mujtaba: So
essentially, these are

00:02:48.317 --> 00:02:51.355
little light
bulb-looking things that

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:56.840
emit light when you drive a
current through them so they

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.788
light up.

00:02:57.788 --> 00:03:01.622
So in a circuit like
this, what happens

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:07.263
is we have a potential drop
or voltage source right here.

00:03:07.263 --> 00:03:10.340
Let's say it is two volts.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.390
And there's a
resistor right here.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.808
And we need a current
to flow through this LED

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:17.052
to light it up.

00:03:17.052 --> 00:03:20.062
So right here I have
a red LED that I'll

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:21.868
show you guys in a minute.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:28.301
But red LEDs have a current
rating of 20 milliamps.

00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:36.438
And in order to make a
circuit where we can light up

00:03:36.438 --> 00:03:39.834
this red LED, we
need to know what

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:44.349
should be this resistor value
for the current in the circuit

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.829
to be exactly this current
that this LED needs to turn on.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.989
Mujtaba: Okay, so we will
be finding this resistor

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.407
value to do this, and this
is a real-life application.

00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:59.985
For example, if you want
to turn on this LED,

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:05.100
so we will need to use Ohm's Law
right here--V equals IR to do

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.600
this.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.340
And we know the voltage--two
volts--and we know the current

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.200
that is 20 milliamps.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:25.824
Mujtaba: So if the current
is 20 milliamps what

00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:28.810
would the resistor value be?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.760
Student: 100.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.038
Mujtaba: Exactly.

00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:39.793
So, now we will use
this in a circuit

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:44.270
and see if our LED turns on.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:53.840
So I'll share my camera with
you guys and see if this works.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.450
Mujtaba: Can you
guys see me now?

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.085
Students: Yes.

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:04.720
Uh huh.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.483
Mujtaba: So now.

00:05:09.483 --> 00:05:16.800
Okay, so now what we
have is the circuit.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.650
Mujtaba: Can you guys
see this circuit?

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.305
Students: Yeah.

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:20.960
Mmm hmm.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.615
Mujtaba: We will be not
worrying about this part

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.090
of the circuit for now.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.510
So the only thing we worry--we
worry about is so there is

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.897
a two volts input right here
in this port and we found that

00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:40.523
a resistor value of 100
ohms will do the job,

00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:46.341
so this is 100 ohms resistor and
we will plug this in from a two

00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:50.389
volt source in this breadboard,
so this is a breadboard.

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.918
If you guys have dealt with
prototyping electronics

00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:56.124
you might have used this.

00:05:56.124 --> 00:06:00.391
It's just a bunch of holes that
are connected to each other.

00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:04.346
So all these five holes in a
row are connected to each other

00:06:04.346 --> 00:06:05.999
and the columns
are not connected

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.828
so you can use them to
essentially make your circuit.

00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:12.323
So we will be connecting
that there and we will

00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:14.071
be using a red LED.

00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:18.774
This is an LED, and
this one is a red one.

00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:21.515
And LEDs have two
legs, essentially.

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.433
The longer one is
the positive one

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:25.600
because they're directional.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.480
And if you connect
them the opposite way

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.852
they don't turn on.

00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:32.554
So the longer leg
will go to positive

00:06:32.554 --> 00:06:34.882
which is connected to
the resistor essentially,

00:06:34.882 --> 00:06:37.605
and then the negative
one will go to ground.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:40.470
So we will connect
this right here.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.650
Mujtaba: And we will
connect the other leg to

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.740
Student: I can't see it.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.106
Mujtaba: Oh sorry.

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:49.606
Yeah.

00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:54.740
So we will connect the other
leg to ground over here.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.778
Mujtaba: So yeah, so
ground right here.

00:06:58.778 --> 00:07:05.191
So in this breadboard, I've
set up this rail at the bottom.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:10.078
So this negative the blue rail
is ground and the positive rail

00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:13.581
is the positive volts that
I'll connect the battery to.

00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:16.840
And I have a voltage
divider set up right here

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.536
that I'll explain in a minute.

00:07:19.536 --> 00:07:23.580
But this essentially takes
my battery which is nine

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.555
volts--this is a nine volt
battery and divides this

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:31.866
into essentially the required
voltage that I need and that is

00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:34.488
two volts right here that
will go into the resistor.

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:43.270
So we will connect this battery
now and see if it works.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.120
Mujtaba: Can you guys see?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.450
Mujtaba: There we go.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.947
So we will have a closer.

00:07:52.947 --> 00:07:55.861
I will connect the battery...

00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:59.930
Mujtaba: battery pin

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:09.340
Mujtaba: Do you see that?.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.040
Student: Yes.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.521
Mujtaba: The red LED turns on.

00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:16.830
So this is a real-life
application of this.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.335
Mujtaba: So, of Ohm's Law.

00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:20.743
You can use it to turn on LEDs.

00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:24.788
You can use it for your personal
projects or anything like that.

00:08:24.788 --> 00:08:27.501
You can buy LEDs,
they're very cheap

00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:31.622
and you can set up the
circuitry on your own

00:08:31.622 --> 00:08:36.469
and make an LED turn on and
do a lot of other cool things

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:37.099
with it.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.559
Mujtaba: Now, LEDs
have--any questions so far?

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.709
Student: No.

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:46.964
Mujtaba: Okay, so now LEDs
have different current ratings.

00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:50.168
Essentially, if you're
turning on a red one,

00:08:50.168 --> 00:08:52.123
you need a different
current to go through it.

00:08:52.123 --> 00:08:54.118
And if you're turning
on a blue one,

00:08:54.118 --> 00:08:57.149
you would need a different
current to go through it.

00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:01.194
Mujtaba: So a blue one, so
this one needs 20 milliamps

00:09:01.194 --> 00:09:03.769
to go through it to turn on.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:05.859
A blue one will
need 30 milliamps

00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:07.949
to go through it to turn on.

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:12.430
Do you guys think if I switch
this red LED with a blue one,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.480
will it turn on right now?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.430
Student: Probably not.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.544
Mujtaba: Exactly.

00:09:20.544 --> 00:09:25.939
It will not turn on
because because we set up

00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:29.219
this circuit for a 20
milliamp current, which

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:31.982
is lower than the
30 milliamp current

00:09:31.982 --> 00:09:35.816
and that's why the blue
one will not turn on.

00:09:35.816 --> 00:09:40.640
We can test this and
here I have a blue LED.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.050
And we can--

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:47.459
Mujtaba: we can plug
in the blue LED.

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:55.983
Mujtaba: Okay, now I
can plug in the battery

00:09:55.983 --> 00:10:00.720
and see if it works.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.858
Mujtaba: Oh, battery
is connected,

00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:14.790
but the blue LED does not
turn on, or it's very dim.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.673
No, I don't think
it's on at all.

00:10:17.673 --> 00:10:22.466
So, in order to do this--to make
the blue LED turn on--what do

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:26.209
you guys think the
resistor value should be?

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.484
We know the voltage
is two volts.

00:10:29.484 --> 00:10:32.745
We know the current
to be 30 milliamps.

00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:35.070
What should the
resistor value be?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.740
Student: Lower than
this one by two thirds.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.803
Mujtaba: Exactly.

00:10:40.803 --> 00:10:42.929
Something like 67 ohms.

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.599
Mujtaba: So, if
you plug in that,

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:48.269
we can turn on the blue LED.

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:53.651
Mujtaba: So now I will
go on to the concept

00:10:53.651 --> 00:10:56.881
of the voltage divider
which essentially

00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:59.685
is the reason we can take
the nine volt battery

00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:02.064
and connect it to it without
burning anything down.

00:11:02.064 --> 00:11:05.353
And that is essentially when
resistors are in series,

00:11:05.353 --> 00:11:08.142
that is they're
connected to each other

00:11:08.142 --> 00:11:12.472
and they divide the voltage
that goes through them.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:16.578
Think of it as having two
bubbles in your straw.

00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:19.016
When you're trying to
pull out the bubbles

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:21.184
at the bottom of
your boba drink,

00:11:21.184 --> 00:11:23.761
if you have two
bubbles in the straw,

00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:27.393
you need to suck on it a
little harder or essentially

00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:29.594
the pressure drop
across the pipe

00:11:29.594 --> 00:11:34.181
needs to be higher for both
of those bubbles to come up.

00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.073
And that is essentially
what happens here.

00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:41.431
So two resistors in series,
divide the voltage across them

00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:46.209
depending on the
resistor value they have.

00:11:46.209 --> 00:11:50.818
Mujtaba: So without
going to my screen,

00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:54.769
I can just use paper here.

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:56.319
Mujtaba: So that is

00:11:56.319 --> 00:12:01.100
Mujtaba: Can you guys see this?

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.179
Students: Yes.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:05.922
Mujtaba: Okay.

00:12:05.922 --> 00:12:15.513
So if we have one resistor
in series with other resistor

00:12:15.513 --> 00:12:20.339
and if they're--so, the sum of
them the voltage drop across

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:24.492
one of them, so say there is a
voltage drop across the whole

00:12:24.492 --> 00:12:28.156
thing, this goes the
opposite direction, okay.

00:12:28.156 --> 00:12:35.564
So the voltage drop across
one of them--this is R1,

00:12:35.564 --> 00:12:44.576
this is R2--will be the resistor
value of one over the sum

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:50.850
of both of them times
the voltage okay?

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:56.013
Mujtaba: So, essentially the
voltage drop across one of them

00:12:56.013 --> 00:12:59.137
will be the
resistance of that one

00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:03.019
over the sum of both of them
times the total voltage.

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:05.245
Mujtaba: So, that
is essentially what

00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:08.738
we are using here to do this.

00:13:08.738 --> 00:13:14.269
So in order to get
two volts out of this,

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:19.376
what do you guys think the
ratio of these resistors

00:13:19.376 --> 00:13:21.419
is supposed to be?

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:25.816
Essentially, this one resistor
over the sum of resistances

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:28.731
times nine should give us two.

00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:32.799
And that way we can
find two divided by nine

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.410
should be the ratio
of these resistors.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.586
And that is essentially
the resistor value that I

00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:39.419
picked--it's random.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:44.004
So you can pick many different
combinations that gives you

00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:48.799
that ratio, which is
I think 0.2--0.22.

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:56.425
So to get that I chose 1.6
kiloohms resistor and a 5.6

00:13:56.425 --> 00:13:57.499
kiloohm resistor.

00:13:57.499 --> 00:14:04.838
And as you guys can do the
math, 1.6 over the sum of both,

00:14:04.838 --> 00:14:07.984
which is seven
point two will be...

00:14:07.984 --> 00:14:12.480
it's a little odd ratio
but it will be 0.22.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.834
So that times nine gives us
the two volts that we need.

00:14:16.834 --> 00:14:21.009
And that is essentially what
I'm doing in this circuit right

00:14:21.009 --> 00:14:21.509
here.

00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:26.589
Mujtaba: In here.

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:34.810
Mujtaba: So you guys can see
the two yellow resistors.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:41.373
Those two yellow resistors,
one of them is 1.6.

00:14:41.373 --> 00:14:45.664
The one that is
horizontal is 1.6.

00:14:45.664 --> 00:14:49.342
And the other one is 5.6.

00:14:49.342 --> 00:14:52.404
And 1.6 over the
sum of both of them

00:14:52.404 --> 00:14:54.240
gives us the ratio
and that connected

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.279
to the battery which is the
blue and red rail at the bottom.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:00.499
Mujtaba: Right here.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:04.691
Mujtaba: This rail is nine volts
and that divides it and make

00:15:04.691 --> 00:15:05.740
to two volts.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.939
And that's how we find the two
volt from nine volt battery.

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:10.904
Mujtaba: Okay.

00:15:10.904 --> 00:15:11.870
Any questions

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:17.819
Student: Hmm I have a question.

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:18.819
Mujtaba: Yeah.

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:23.075
Student: Like when
we connect something.

00:15:23.075 --> 00:15:28.041
So, in in the
voltage divider, we

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:32.803
can add something that has
like finite resistance.

00:15:32.803 --> 00:15:36.489
So, we change effective
resistance of one

00:15:36.489 --> 00:15:39.687
of the resistors
in voltage divider.

00:15:39.687 --> 00:15:45.620
How like how can how do we
need to pick resistances

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.720
of voltage divider by the
resistance to make this more--

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.275
Mujtaba: Which affects lower?

00:15:52.275 --> 00:15:57.329
So you are you talking about
the two volts that at the end

00:15:57.329 --> 00:16:00.639
we are getting you want
to make that lower?

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.656
Student: No.

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:07.254
I mean like there are two
volts in the voltage voltage

00:16:07.254 --> 00:16:11.461
divider if you don't
connect anything to it,

00:16:11.461 --> 00:16:15.803
but if you connect something
the effective resistance

00:16:15.803 --> 00:16:18.401
of something we
connect and resist.

00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:20.671
And there's a
resistance too, which

00:16:20.671 --> 00:16:23.672
we connect with the scheme
in parallel, changes.

00:16:23.672 --> 00:16:27.209
And we want to have two
volts, exactly two volts.

00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:29.566
Mujtaba: That is,
that is correct.

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:30.745
That is correct.

00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:35.031
If you connect it in series, it
changes the effective voltage

00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:37.696
drop or the effective
resistance and therefore

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:40.744
the effective voltage
drop across one resistor.

00:16:40.744 --> 00:16:45.506
But, so the way it is
connected to this circuit,

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:49.307
and this diagram or in
any other situation when

00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:50.935
you're connecting
something, you're

00:16:50.935 --> 00:16:52.522
usually connected in parallel.

00:16:52.522 --> 00:16:56.004
So in parallel, the
voltage drop stays the same

00:16:56.004 --> 00:16:58.342
across both of those
parallel things.

00:16:58.342 --> 00:17:02.785
Ideally, that would be the ideal
scenario, but in real life,

00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:06.476
there is a slight drop across
the parallel setup because

00:17:06.476 --> 00:17:09.963
of the losses in the circuitry
and all the other things,

00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:12.890
but in in theory, when you
connect things in parallel,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.272
the voltage drop across both
of them will stay the same.

00:17:17.272 --> 00:17:24.149
And that's why the LED circuit
is connected in parallel

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:28.514
to the 1.6 volts or
1.6 kiloohm resistor

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:31.742
and therefore the voltage
drop across that resistor

00:17:31.742 --> 00:17:34.160
stays two volts only.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.276
Student: What would happen if
too much current run through,

00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:41.500
yeah, LED.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.856
Mujtaba: So the
LED is essentially

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:50.352
a piece of material that has
electrons at certain transition

00:17:50.352 --> 00:17:50.852
states.

00:17:50.852 --> 00:17:55.666
So the way it emits emit
light or emits light

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:58.640
is essentially activation
of those electrons.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.720
And that's how it
emits light and it

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.860
requires certain energy level to
cause the activation to happen.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.648
If there's too much energy, and
most of the commercial ones,

00:18:10.648 --> 00:18:11.513
they just break.

00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:14.974
So the LED just breaks and
if you put too much current

00:18:14.974 --> 00:18:17.884
through it, it just breaks
and they will not work again,

00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:20.317
which essentially means that
the material whatever they're

00:18:20.317 --> 00:18:25.144
using in there just melts
down or the energy for it

00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:26.461
is too much.

00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:32.872
And some of the other cases,
if you put too much current

00:18:32.872 --> 00:18:36.885
through a thin wire,
especially when it's it

00:18:36.885 --> 00:18:39.908
doesn't have a heatsink
in any other way.

00:18:39.908 --> 00:18:41.798
It will just melt down.

00:18:41.798 --> 00:18:44.159
So in short answer
LED just breaks

00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:46.990
and you will not be
able to use it again.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.870
Mujtaba: Yeah.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.070
I hope that was clear.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.590
You can use it in
your own projects.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.780
One of the projects I
actually made was a clock.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.650
I made a clock for my room.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.334
I don't have it here
right now but it

00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:08.832
was a clock that was controlled
by by an Arduino which

00:19:08.832 --> 00:19:10.602
is just a microprocessor.

00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:15.844
And each of the twelve numbers
on the clock were LEDs.

00:19:15.844 --> 00:19:19.132
And it would turn on
depending on the hour

00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:21.897
and the minute of
the day it was so you

00:19:21.897 --> 00:19:25.336
can use a simple calculations
like this like ohms law

00:19:25.336 --> 00:19:27.803
and practice to
find the resistor

00:19:27.803 --> 00:19:30.728
values for the
different LEDs that you

00:19:30.728 --> 00:19:35.885
will be using in that case,
the clock for example.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.980
PROFESSOR: And today I'm going
to talk about DNA sequencing.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
And I want to start by
just sort of illustrating

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.830
an example of how knowing the
DNA sequence can be helpful.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.310
So you remember in
the last lecture,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.050
we talked about how
one might identify

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730
a gene through functional
complementation.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.950
And this process involved
making a DNA library that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.750
had different fragments of DNA
cloned into different plasmids

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.770
and then involved finding the
needle in the haystack where

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.200
you find the gene that can
rescue a defect in a mutant

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.920
that you have.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:15.500
So if this line that I'm
drawing here is genomic DNA,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.820
and it could be
genomic DNA from,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.700
let's say, a prototroph
for LEU2, the leucine gene.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.380
So this is from a prototroph.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.140
Then you could cut up
the DNA with EcoRI.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.460
And if there is not a
restriction site in this LEU2

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.710
gene, you get a fragment
that contains the LEU2 gene.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.100
And then you could clone this
into some type of plasmid

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.750
that replicates in the organism
that you're introducing

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.910
it and propagating it in.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.590
And so that would allow you
to then test whether or not

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.750
this piece of DNA that you have
compliments a LEU2 auxotroph,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.250
OK?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.310
Now one thing I
want to point out

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:23.190
is that because these EcoR1
sites, these sticky ends,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.230
would recognize this EcoR1
one end or this EcoR1 end,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.780
you can imagine that this gene--

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.330
if the gene reads
this way to this way--

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.420
it could insert this
way into the plasmid.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.340
Or it could insert in
the opposite direction.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.120
So it could be inverted.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.270
So this would have some sort
of origin of replication

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.960
and some type of
selectable marker.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.540
But if you have the
same restriction site

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.210
it can insert one way
or the opposite way.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.680
That's just one thing
I wanted to point out.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.290
Now let's say
rather than leucine,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.160
you're interested in
cycling dependent kinase,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.000
and you had a mutant end CDK
and you had this sequence

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.880
of your yeast CDK gene.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.240
Well, rather than having to
dig through a whole library

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.530
of pieces of DNA
for the CDK gene,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.930
basically you're sort of
fishing for that needle

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.190
in the haystack.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.010
If you knew the sequence
of the human genome,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.850
you'd be able to identify
similar genes by sequence

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.980
homology.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.860
And you could then take
a more direct approach,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.600
where you take--

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.360
let's say you have
a piece of human DNA

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.930
now, double stranded DNA,
and it has the CDK gene.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.160
You could take human
DNA with this CDK gene.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.520
And you have unique
sequence around the CDK

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.885
gene, which would allow
you to denature this DNA.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.010
And if you denature
the DNA, you'd

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.915
get two single strands of DNA.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.240
And you could then
design primers

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.350
that recognize unique sequences
flanking the CDK gene.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.700
So you could imagine
you'd have a primer here

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.590
and a primer here.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.670
And then you could use PCR
to amplify specifically

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.730
CDK gene from, it could be the
genome or from some library.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.960
And then you get this fragment
here, which includes CDK.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.230
So knowing the
sequence of the genome

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.390
would allow you to more
rapidly go from maybe a gene

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.720
that you've identified as being
important in one organism,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.650
and find the human equivalent
that might be doing something

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.280
similar in humans.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.230
So this step here
is basically PCR.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.820
And let's say the CDK gene
had restriction sites.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.350
Let's see, we'll say
restriction site K and A here.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.420
Then if you have these
restriction sites

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.360
in your fragment of
DNA, you can then

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200
digest or cut that piece of
DNA with these restriction

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.570
endonucleases.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.740
And then you'd get
a fragment of CDK

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.820
that has K and A sticky ends.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.420
We'll pretend that both
of these have sticky ends.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.935
And now you have unique
sticky ends between K and A.

00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:58.740
And you might have a vector
that also has these two sites.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.510
And you could digest this
vector with these two enzymes.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.890
And that would allow you
to insert the specific gene

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.920
in this plasmid.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.350
And if you have
two unique sites,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.830
because K only recognizes K
here and A only recognizes A,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.690
then it will ligate in.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.540
But you can do it with
a specific orientation

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.810
because you have two
different restriction sites.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.360
So I hope you all see how
it's with one restriction

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.590
site versus two.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.680
All right.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.230
Now let's say you want to do
something more complicated

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.270
than this.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.310
Let's say rather than just
identifying the gene that's

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.500
involved in cell division, you
want to engineer a new gene,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.210
in order to determine where
this particular protein, CDK,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.140
localizes in the cell.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:09.470
So we have CDK, which could
be from yeast or human,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.290
it doesn't matter.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.090
And you want to engineer
a new protein, basically,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.790
that you can see.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.670
So remember Professor
Imperiali introduced

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.360
green fluorescent protein
earlier in the year.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.700
And this green
fluorescent protein

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.050
is from a gene from jellyfish.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.700
So now we could, using
what I've told you,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.580
reconstruct or
engineer a gene that

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.130
has DNA from three
different organisms,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.910
in order to make a
CDK variant that we

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.650
are able to see in the cell.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.750
So remember, a green fluorescent
protein is like a beacon,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.700
if it's attached to a protein.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.460
If you shine blue light on
it, it emits green light.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:04.220
And so you can use a fluorescent
microscope in order to see it.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.240
In this case, let's say there's
also another restriction site

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.730
here, R. And let's say you
have a fragment of GFP that

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.630
has two restriction sites,
A and R. You could then

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.990
cut this fragment
and this fragment

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.050
with these restriction
enzymes A and R.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:30.500
And you could insert GFP at
the C terminus of the CDK gene.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:38.720
So you could go and have a
gene that has CDK GFP inserted

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.169
inside a bacterial vector.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.680
Now which one of
these junction sites

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.840
do you think would be
most sensitive in doing

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.130
this type of experiment?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.060
So there are three
junction sites.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.447
There's this one, this
one, and this one.

00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:58.030
Which is the one
you're probably going

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.870
to put the most
thought into when

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.000
you're doing this experiment?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.676
Yes, Miles.

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:06.450
AUDIENCE: The A?

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.000
ADAM MARTIN: The A site.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.160
Miles is exactly right.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.750
This one is going
to be important.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.744
And why did you
choose that site?

00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:18.100
AUDIENCE: Of the
three sites, two

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:24.874
are half insert, half
originals [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:24.874 --> 00:09:29.360
But at A, both sides
of it are inserts.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.825
So [INAUDIBLE] carefully.

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:33.200
ADAM MARTIN: And
if you're trying

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.540
to make a fusion
protein, what's going

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.900
to be an important
quality of this?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.920
Malik, DID you have a point?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:49.435
AUDIENCE: Well, they
try to [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:52.369
we'd have to make sure
that the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:56.935 --> 00:09:58.060
ADAM MARTIN: Excellent job.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.450
So Malik just pointed out
two really important things.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.330
To make this a
fusion protein, you

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.940
have two different
open reading frames.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.920
These two open
reading frames have

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.410
to be in frame with each other.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.850
So this junction here
has to be in frame where

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.060
GFP is in frame
with CDK, meaning

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:26.080
that you're reading the
same triplet codons for GFP,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.450
there in the same frame as CDK.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.090
Also, you want to make sure
there's no stop codon here.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.310
Because if you had
a stop codon here,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.650
you're just going to
make a CDK protein.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.510
And then it's going
to stop and then

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.260
you won't have it fused to GFP.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.080
And you guys will work through
more of these in the homework.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.200
So you'll be able to
get a sense of it.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.870
So now for the remainder
of this lecture

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.750
and also for Monday's
lecture, I want

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.840
to go through a
problem with you.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.580
Basically, if you have a given
disease that's heritable,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.380
how might you go from
knowing that disease

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.640
is heritable to
finding out what gene

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.940
is responsible for
that given disease?

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.740
And this is going
to involve thinking

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.820
about different levels of
resolution, in terms of maps.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.480
So the highest resolution
map you can have

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.780
for a genome is the sequence.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:37.120
You can have the full
nucleotide sequence of a genome.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.220
And that's the highest
possible resolution

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.960
because you have
single nucleotide

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.540
resolution as to what
every single base pair is.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.320
But that's like knowing
like your apartment

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.010
number and your street
number and basically knowing

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.300
everything.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.080
But starting out, you might want
to know what continent it's on,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.050
or what country is it in.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:07.300
And so you first have to narrow
down the possible locations

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.520
for a given disease gene.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.080
And that will, at first, involve
establishing what chromosome

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.970
and what region of a
chromosome a given disease

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.710
allele is linked to.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:29.860
And that involves making
essentially a linkage map,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.290
where you establish where a
disease gene is located based

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:40.960
on its linkage to known markers
that are present in the genome.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.930
Now this is going to require
that you remember back

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.600
two weeks ago, to when
we talked about linkage

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.280
and recombination.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.970
And you'll recall
that we were looking

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:05.110
at the linkage between genes
and flies and genes and yeast.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.640
One difference between that
type of linkage mapping

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.100
and human linkage
mapping is we don't

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.950
have really clear traits that
are defined by single genes.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.660
You can't just take hair color
and map the hair color gene

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.180
to link it to a disease gene.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.740
Because hair color is determined
by many, many different genes.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.740
So in fruit flies, you
can take white eyes

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.620
and see if it's connected
with yellow body color

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.790
because both of those are
determined by single genes.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.590
So we need something other than
just having phenotypic traits

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.150
that we can track.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.330
We need what are known
as molecular markers

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.760
to be able to perform
linkage mapping.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.070
And so what we need in
these molecular markers--

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.530
well, if we just
think about if we

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:09.490
wanted to determine the linkage
between the A and B genes.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.290
And if you did this
cross, would you

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.655
be able to determine linkage?

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.050
Georgia, you made a
motion that was correct.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.030
Tell me.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.030
Why did you shake your head no?

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.110
AUDIENCE: They'd
all be heterozygous.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.100
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah they'd
all be heterozygous.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.420
Because this individual
has the same allele

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.460
on both chromosomes,
you're not going

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.690
to be able to differentiate
one chromosome from the other.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.610
And so the point
I want to make is

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.450
that in order to see linkage,
what you need is variation.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.850
So we need to have variation.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.650
And another term for genetic
variation is polymorphism.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:11.310
So we need polymorphism,
or genetic variation,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.320
between these molecular markers.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.150
We also need genetic
variation in the disease.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.380
But we have that.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.560
We have individuals
that are affected

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.180
by a disease and
individuals that

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.590
are not affected by a disease.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.740
So we have variation
in alleles there.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.480
But in order to map it
with a molecular marker,

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.850
to map linkage to
a molecular marker,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.520
you also need variation here.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.890
So the problem with
this cross is here

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.370
you need to have heterozygote.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:53.160
There needs to be variation
in this individual, where

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.930
both of these alleles
are heterozygous.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.680
So now I want to talk about
some of these molecular markers

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.700
that we can use, and how
they vary between individuals

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.050
and between chromosomes.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.450
Now this is going to be maybe
the lowest resolution map.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.990
But I'm talking about
this linkage map here.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.780
And you can see highlighted
that the bottom here

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.450
are various types
of polymorphisms

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.380
that we can use to
link a given disease

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.340
allele to a specific
chromosome and a specific place

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.280
on chromosome.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:45.310
So I'll start with the first
one, which is a simple sequence

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.510
repeat.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.860
It goes by many names.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.035
But I will stick with
what's on the slide.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:17:00.280
So a simple sequence repeat is
also known as a microsatellite.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.690
So you might see that
term floating around,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.880
if you're reading about this.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.290
And what a simple sequence
repeat is, as the name implies,

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.230
it's a simple sequence.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.560
It could be a
dinucleotide, like CA.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.390
And it's just a
dinucleotide that's

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.050
repeated over and over again.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.560
So on a chromosome, you
might have a unique sequence,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.900
which I'll just
draw as a line. ,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.160
And then you could have a CA
dinucleotide that's repeated

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.570
some number of times, N. And
then that's followed by another

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.480
unique sequence.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.900
And that's what's present in it.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.870
So that would be one strand.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.850
And then in the
opposite strand, you'd

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.360
have a unique sequence,
the complement of CA,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.140
which is GT, and then,
again, unique sequence.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:18:00.040
And so there's variation in the
number of repeats of the CA.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.530
And so there's polymorphism.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.980
So we can use this
to establish linkage

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.890
between this marker
and a phenotype,

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.250
like a disease phenotype.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.820
So how might you detect
the number of repeats

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.440
that are present here?

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.140
Anyone have an idea of a
tool that we've discussed

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.280
that could be used here?

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.340
So one hint that I gave you
is that the sequence here

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.930
is unique and the
sequence here is unique.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.160
So is there a way we can
leverage that unique sequence

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.058
to determine whether
there's a difference

00:18:36.058 --> 00:18:37.100
in the number of repeats?

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.860
What's a technique we
discussed that involves

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.530
some component of the technique
recognizing a unique sequence?

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.140
Yeah, Natalie?

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.790
AUDIENCE: CRISPR Cas9.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.720
ADAM MARTIN: Well, CRISPR
Cas9 is a possibility.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.860
Jeremy, did you have an idea?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.740
AUDIENCE: PCR?

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.510
ADAM MARTIN: PCR-- so it's true.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.770
You could get it
to recognize that.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.520
But then you have to
detect it, somehow.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.510
So what's more
commonly used is PCR.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.090
Those are both good ideas.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.780
But using PCR, you could
design a primer here

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.460
and a primer here.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.000
And you could amplify
this repeat sequence.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.430
And the number of
repeats would determine

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.000
the size of your PCR fragment.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.970
So if you did PCR, then
you'd get a PCR fragment that

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:41.130
has the primers on each end,
but then has this certain size

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.130
based on the number of repeats.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.680
So in that case, we
need some sort of tool

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.380
that enables us to determine
the size of a particular DNA

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.090
fragment.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.270
And so I'm going to just
introduce to you one such tool,

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.870
which is gel electrophoresis.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.110
And gel electrophoresis
involves taking DNA

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.400
that you've generated, by
either PCR or by cutting up

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.320
DNA with a restriction
enzyme, and loading it

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.680
in a gel that has agarose.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.150
Maybe it's composed of agarose.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.970
It could be composed
of polyacrylamide.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.360
And then because DNA
is negatively charged,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.380
the backbone, if you run
a current through it,

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.290
such as the positive
electrode is at the bottom,

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:36.540
then the DNA is going to
snake through this gel.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.460
Now we'll do a
quick demonstration,

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.510
if you two could come up.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.520
I need one volunteer.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.580
Ori, find 10 of your
friends and bring them down.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.730
All right.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.670
That's probably good.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.250
Yeah.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.680
All right, Hannah,
why don't you--

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.260
you guys have to link up, OK?

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:08.950
Stay over here.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:09.950
We'll start at this end.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.800
This is the negative
electrode over here.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.950
The positive electrode is
going to be down there.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.550
And Jackie is going to
be our single nucleotide.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.220
You guys link like--

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.580
yeah.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.080
You don't have to do-si-do,
or anything like that.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.010
All right.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.750
Now what I want
you guys to do is

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.570
I want you to slalom
through these cones

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.250
like it's all agarose gel.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.430
So that you're going
towards the other side.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.680
And I'm going to turn
on the current now.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.220
So go.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.590
All right, stop.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.090
All right.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.090
See how the shorter
DNA fragment is

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.790
able to more easily
navigate through the cones

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.370
and get farther.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.770
So it was somewhat rigged.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:02.270
I know.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.900
But I just needed some way
to make sure you always

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.050
remember that the shorter
nucleotide, or the shorter

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.480
fragment, is going
to migrate faster.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.830
You guys can go back up.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.120
Thank you for your
participation.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.610
Let's give them
round of applause.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.068
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.540
All right.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.660
So what you just saw is that
the longer DNA fragments,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.540
they're going to be
more inhibited by moving

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.710
through the gel.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.960
And so they're going to
move slower and thus,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.827
not move as far in the gel.

00:22:36.827 --> 00:22:38.410
Whereas, the small
fragments are going

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.600
to move much faster
because they're

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.870
able to maneuver their
way through this gel

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.710
much more quickly.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.060
So there's going to be an
inverse proportionality

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:55.840
between the size of the DNA
chain and its rate of movement.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.240
You're always going
to see the shorter DNA

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.190
fragment moving faster.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.990
So what one of
these gels actually

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.120
looks like is shown here.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.260
So this is a DNA
gel that's agarose.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.890
And DNA has been run in
these different samples.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.140
And what you're
seeing is this gel

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.480
is subsequently
stained with a dye,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.080
like ethidium bromide, which
allows you to visualize

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.690
the individual DNA fragments.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.080
And so a band on this gel
indicates a whole bunch

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.100
of DNA fragments that are
all roughly the same length.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.740
So essentially, you
can measure DNA length

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.270
using this technique.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.530
What's over here at
the end of the gel,

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.010
this is probably some
sort of DNA ladder,

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.470
where you have DNA
fragments of known length

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.230
that you can use to
calibrate the length

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.980
of these bands over here.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.520
So this is how you
measure DNA length.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.540
And we're going to use
it over and over again,

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.440
as we talk about
DNA and sequencing.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.360
So now, let's think
about how this

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.480
is going to help us
establish linkage

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.880
between a particular
marker in the genome

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.920
and a genetic disease.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.330
So if we think about these
microsatellite repeats,

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.890
I told you they're polymorphic.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.400
They exhibit a lot
of variation in size.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.590
And so here's an
example showing you

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.940
a female who has two
intermediate sized

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.500
microsatellites.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.540
And if you look at this--

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.660
if you did PCR and
measured the size of these,

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.660
you get two different
bands because there

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.690
are two different alleles
of different length here.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:40.120
So you can see this individual
has two intermediate length

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.420
repeats.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.100
And this person has had
children with an individual

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.490
that has a short and
a long microsatellite.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.640
And you can see that
on the gel, here.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.750
Now this female is
affected by some disease.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.690
And these two individuals
have children.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.500
And you can see that a
number of those children

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.460
are affected by the disease.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.820
So what mode of inheritance
does this look like?

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.000
If you had your choice
between autosomal recessive,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.690
autosomal dominant,
sex linked dominant,

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:22.460
and sex linked recessive,
what mode of inheritance

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.480
is this looking like?

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.080
Oh, Carmen.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.200
AUDIENCE: Autosomal recessive.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.550
ADAM MARTIN:
Autosomal recessive?

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.900
Why do you go with recessive?

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.010
Yeah, go ahead.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.490
AUDIENCE: Because there
is a male that's affected.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.895
But not both of the
parents are affected.

00:25:47.895 --> 00:25:55.220
So it seems like the
father is heterozygous

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.232
and the mother is
homozygous recessive.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.730
ADAM MARTIN: That's possible.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.180
That's exactly the
logic I want to see.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.488
Is there another possibility?

00:26:08.488 --> 00:26:09.030
Yeah, Jeremy.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.238
AUDIENCE: Autosomal dominant.

00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:13.380
ADAM MARTIN: It could also
be autosomal dominant.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.488
So you're right.

00:26:14.488 --> 00:26:15.030
You're right.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:19.890
If this was not a rare
disease, then that male

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.790
could care be a carrier
and could be passing it

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.520
on to half the children.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.720
So that's good.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.550
You'd essentially
need more information

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.760
to differentiate between
autosomal recessive

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.620
and autosomal dominant.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.210
For the purposes of
this, we're going

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:40.500
to go with autosomal dominant.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.890
And what you see
is that you want

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.260
to look at the
affected individuals

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.000
and see if the disease phenotype
is linked, or connected,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.480
with one of these
microsatellite alleles.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.530
So if we look at--

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.750
we basically PCR DNA from
all these individuals.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.700
And if you look at
who is affected,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.500
each one of the individuals
has this M double prime band.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.570
And none of the unaffected
individuals has it.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.970
So obviously, it would be better
to have more pedigrees and more

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.370
data to really
establish significance

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.870
between this linkage.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.390
But this is just
a simple example,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.090
showing what you
could possibly see

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.120
if you have one of these
molecular markers linked

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.860
to a particular disease allele.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.910
So that kind of
establishes the principle.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.540
Now let's think about what are
some other molecular markers

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.290
that are possible?

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.850
So another type of
marker, and this

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.210
is one that's the most
common one, if I go here.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.110
So here, you see here's
is a linkage map, here.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.350
And you see most of
these bands are green.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.080
And the green markers,
here, are what

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.610
are known as Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms, or SNPs.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.780
So single nucleotide
polymorphisms--

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.630
and this is abbreviated SNP.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.730
And what a single nucleotide
polymorphism is, is it's

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:37.680
a variation of a nucleotide at
a single position in the genome.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.880
So it's just a one base pair
difference at a position.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:54.300
So there's variation of single
nucleotide at a given position,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.380
at a position in the genome.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.970
And because that's a
pretty general definition,

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.780
there are tons of
these in the genome.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.640
Now one thing to
think about is you

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.110
could have a mutation in an
individual that creates a SNP.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.710
So you could have a de
novo formation of a SNP.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.580
But if you have
a SNP and it gets

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.580
incorporated to the
gametes of an individual,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.710
then that variant is
going to be passed

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.260
on to the next generation.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.110
So this is something
that could occur de novo.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.540
But it is also heritable.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.810
And if it's heritable,
then you can follow it

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.630
and use it to
determine if a given

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.155
variant is linked to a given
phenotype, like a disease.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.980
So to identify a single
nucleotide polymorphism,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.190
it's helpful to be able
to sequence the DNA.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.830
And I'll talk about how we
could do that in just a minute.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:04.060
But before I go on, I
just want to point out

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:10.000
a subclass of SNPs that can be
visualized without sequencing.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.490
And these are called restriction
fragment length polymorphisms.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.640
So restriction
fragment-- so it's

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.980
going to involve some
type of restriction

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:26.890
enzyme digest
length polymorphism.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.630
It's a long word.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.100
But it's abbreviated RFLP.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.160
And what this is,
is it's a variation

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.960
of a single nucleotide.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.720
But this is a subclass of SNP.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.810
Because this is when
the variation occurs

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.080
in a restriction site
for a restriction enzyme.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.250
So if you remember
your good friend EcoR1,

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.270
EcoR1 recognizes the
nucleotide sequence GAATTC.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:04.270
And EcoR1 only cleaves DNA
sequence that has GAATTC.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:13.000
So if there was a single
nucleotide variation

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.370
in the sequence,
such that it's now

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:24.190
GATTTC, or something like that,
that destroys the EcoR1 site.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:28.300
And so EcoR1 will no longer
be able to recognize this site

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.340
in the genome and cut it.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.010
So you could imagine
that if you had

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:41.980
one individual in the genome
having three EcoR1 sites,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.700
if you digest this region,
you'd get two fragments.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.720
But if you destroyed
the one in the middle,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.250
then if you digested
this piece of DNA,

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.825
then you'd only
get one fragment.

00:31:57.825 --> 00:31:58.700
And that's something.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.000
Because it results in
different sizes of fragments,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.560
that's something
you can see just

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.500
by doing DNA electrophoresis.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.660
And maybe you would
use some method

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.600
to detect this specific
region, so that you're not

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.820
looking at all the
DNA in the genome,

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.080
but you're establishing
linkage to this specific area.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.090
You could use PCR.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.330
You can have PCR
primers here and here.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.160
And you could then
cut with EcoR1.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.560
In one case, you'd
get two fragments.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.690
In this case, you'd
get two fragments.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.960
In this case, if you amplified
this region of the genome

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.140
and cut with EcoR1, you'd
only get one fragment.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.580
So you'd be able
to differentiate

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.530
between those possibilities.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.700
Yes, Malik.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.490
AUDIENCE: When you use
PCR, are there [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:45.658 --> 00:32:46.700
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.373
AUDIENCE: Are there [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:48.373 --> 00:32:49.040
ADAM MARTIN: Oh.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.500
You're saying what
causes it to stop?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.820
That's a great question, Malik.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.320
Yeah.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.620
So initially, it's
not going to stop.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.360
That's absolutely right.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.540
But because every step,
each time you replicate,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.350
it's then primed
with another primer.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:10.940
So you'd replicate something
like this that's too long.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.700
But then the reverse primer
would replicate like this.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.650
And it would stop.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.130
So if you go back to my
slide from last lecture,

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.270
look through that and see if
it makes sense how it's ending.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.730
Because if you do this
30 times, you really

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:30.590
will enrich for a fragment
that stops and ends at the two

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:35.900
primers, or begins and ends at
the two primers, I should say.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.800
Good question.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.120
Thank you.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.620
All right.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.160
Now, let's talk
about DNA sequencing.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.880
Because as I showed
you, obviously,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.280
these SNPs, because there
are so many of them,

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.080
are probably the most useful
of these markers to narrow in

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.690
on where your disease gene is.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:58.160
And to detect a SNP, we need
to be able to sequence DNA.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.810
So I'm going to
start with an older

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.530
method for DNA sequencing,
which conceptually,

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.250
is very similar to how we
do DNA sequencing today.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.139
And so it will
illustrate my point.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:19.550
And then at the end, I'll talk
about more modern techniques

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.600
to sequencing.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.570
So the technique I'm
going to introduce to you

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.639
is called Sanger sequencing.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.230
And that's because it was
identified by an individual

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.130
named Fred Sanger.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:43.429
And I'm going to just take
a very simple DNA sequence,

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.600
in order to illustrate how
Sanger sequencing works.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.130
So let's take a sequence
that's really simple.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.810
This is very, very simple,
and then more sequence here.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.800
So let's say we want to
determine the nucleotide that's

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.120
at every position of
this DNA fragment.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.790
So one way we could
maybe conceptually

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.950
think about doing
this, is to try

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:28.440
to let DNA polymerase tell us
where given nucleotides are.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.690
And if we're going to
use DNA polymerase, what

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.780
are we going to need, in order
to facilitate this process?

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:37.970
Yes, Rachel.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.560
ADAM MARTIN: You're going to
need nucleotides, definitely.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.660
So we're going to
need nucleotides.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.130
What else?

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:49.080
To start, what are
you going to need?

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.916
Miles?

00:35:49.916 --> 00:35:50.770
AUDIENCE: Primer.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.937
ADAM MARTIN: You're going
to need a primer, exactly.

00:35:52.937 --> 00:35:53.920
Good job.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.680
So you need a primer.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.660
So here's a primer.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.130
And now, we're going to try to
get DNA polymerase to tell us

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.560
whenever there is a given
nucleotide in this DNA

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.060
sequence.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.540
And so think with me.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:19.860
Let's say we were able to get
DNA polymerase to stop whenever

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.770
there was a certain nucleotide.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.980
So if we go through just
a couple nucleotides,

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:32.310
let's say, at first, we want
DNA polymerase to stop whenever

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:37.350
there's an A. So
let's say there was

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.400
a possibility it would
stop at this A. If it's

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.360
stopped at this
A, you'd generate

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.270
a fragment of this length.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.860
But if it read on
through that A,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:53.160
there's another possibility
that it would stop at this A.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.730
So we're kind of looking
at when these are stopping.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:04.200
And the final possibility is
it goes on and stops at this A.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.740
So if this DNA polymerase
stopped only at As,

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.580
you'd get fragments that are
these three discrete lengths.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.050
Now let's consider
another possibility.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:24.160
So pink here is stop
at A. And in blue, I'm

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.670
going to draw what would
happen if it stopped at T.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.040
So they all start
from the same place.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.260
If it stopped at
T, it would just

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.895
stop one nucleotide beyond
this A in this simple sequence.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.920
So in blue here,
this is stop at T.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.420
But if it's just a
possibility, it stops.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.170
And some of the polymerases
could go beyond this T

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:57.730
and go to the next
T and stop here.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.210
And again, this would be
one nucleotide length longer

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.450
than this pink one, here.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.420
And the final one would--

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.920
I'll just draw it down here--

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.380
would get out to
this last T, here.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.130
So what you see is if we could
get DNA polymerase to stop

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.480
at these discrete
positions, we'd

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.230
get a different sized
fragments, whether it

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:27.730
was stopping at one nucleotide
versus the other nucleotide.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.490
You all see how this is
resulting in different fragment

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.780
lengths.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.820
Yes, Andrew.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.870
AUDIENCE: How would you
create a pattern [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.990
ADAM MARTIN: There
are companies now.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.670
You can basically
take nucleotides

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.420
and synthesize these
primers chemically,

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.210
not using DNA polymerase.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.844
AUDIENCE: I'm saying how would
you know what primer to use,

00:38:50.844 --> 00:38:52.330
if you don't know the sequence?

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.830
ADAM MARTIN: Oh,
in this case, you'd

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:58.030
have to start with some
sequence that you know.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.150
So in most sequencing
technologies,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.720
you kind of make a DNA
library, where you know

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.070
the sequence of the vector.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.590
And then you'd use the
vector sequence as a primer

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.770
to sequence into the
unknown sequence.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.670
Great question.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.740
Good job.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.110
All right.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:21.190
So what we need now then is
some sort of tool or ability

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:26.080
to stop DNA polymerase when
there's a certain nucleotide

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.540
base.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.200
And to do that, we can
use this type of molecule,

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.670
here, which is known
as a dideoxynucleotide.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:42.070
Remember, for DNA polymerase
to elongate a chain,

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.500
it requires that the last base
have a three prime hydroxyl.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:53.110
And so what this
dideoxynucleoside triphosphate

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.040
is, is it's a nucleoside
triphosphate that

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.840
lacks a three prime hydroxyl.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.680
Here, I'll highlight that.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.820
So you see this guy?

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.150
You see it bolt the highlight H?

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.220
There's a hydrogen there
on the three prime carbon,

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:13.930
rather than the
normal hydroxyl group.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:20.620
So if this base gets
incorporated into a elongating

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:26.080
chain, DNA polymerase is not
going to be able to move on.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:34.570
So this method where you can
add a certain dideoxynucleoside

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.770
triphosphate to stop
chain elongation

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.430
is known as a chain
termination method.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:46.030
So you're getting
chain termination.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.430
And you're getting
this chain termination

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:52.120
with a specific
dideoxynucleoside triphosphate.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.990
So these dideoxynucleotide
triphosphates,

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.770
if they get incorporated
into the DNA,

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.590
are going to halt the
synthesis of that DNA strand.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:08.860
So if we take our
example, here, this

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:14.350
might be a reaction that has
dideoxythymidine triphosphate.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:21.520
So if we had dideoxythymidine
triphosphate in this sample

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.850
and it's elongating, then
when the polymerase reaches

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.890
this point, there's
a possibility

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:33.490
that it will incorporate the
dideoxynucleoside triphosphate.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.870
And if this is a
dideoxynucleoside triphosphate,

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:42.070
then there won't be a
three prime hydroxyl.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:48.340
And DNA polymerase will just
be like, oh, I can't go on!

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.420
Because it's not going to
have a three prime hydroxyl.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.010
So it's not going to
be able to continue

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.830
with the next nucleotide.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:00.040
So this is known as
chain termination.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.415
So let me take you
through an example, here.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.520
All right.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.330
So here's an example
that you have a slide of.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.520
And again, there's
a template strand,

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.520
which is the top strand.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.330
And this method requires
that you have a primer.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.535
And what's often done
is you label the primer.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:28.690
So the first step is you
have to denature your DNA.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.820
So you have to go from
double stranded DNA

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.050
to a single stranded DNA.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:41.000
And then you mix the
double stranded DNA

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.110
with first, this
labeled primer, such

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:49.940
that the primer can then yield
to the single stranded DNA.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.846
You need DNA polymerase,
as I've mentioned.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.990
And as, I believe,
Rachel mentioned

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.650
before, you need the
building blocks of DNA.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.680
So you need the four
dideoxynucleoside

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.450
triphosphates.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.330
So you always have the
four dideoxynucleotide

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.030
triphosphates.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.100
But what's special
here is you're

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.480
going to spike several
reactions with one

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.630
of the dideoxynucleoside
triphosphates.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:28.400
So you spike the reaction
with a tiny amount

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.190
of one of your
dideoxynucleoside triphosphates.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.770
So let's say you have
a reaction, here.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:45.970
And this this one here has
dideoxyadenosine triphosphate.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.800
Then polymerase will
along get this strand

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.040
until there's a thymidine
on the template.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.870
And then there's a
possibility that it will

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:57.170
incorporate this dideoxy NTP.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.480
And if it does, then you
get chain termination.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.760
And you get a fragment
of this length.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.460
But the other possibility,
because there is still

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.420
the deoxy form of
the NTP present,

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.550
it's possible that
it incorporates

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.760
a deoxyadenosine
triphosphate there.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.050
And keeps going, and then
incorporates a dideoxy ATP

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.890
later on, where
you have another T.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.800
And so the polymerase
will essentially randomly

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.410
stop at these different
thymidine residues,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.070
depending on whether or not a
dideoxynucleoside triphosphate

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:35.690
is incorporated.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.480
And that means for a given
reaction, one in which

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.230
you have dideoxy ATP,
you get a certain pattern

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:46.640
of bands that represent
the length of fragments,

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:52.130
where you have, in this
case, a thymidine base.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:55.790
And then you do this for
all four bases, where

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.410
you have four reactions, each
with a different base that's

00:44:59.410 --> 00:44:59.910
dideoxy.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.700
So when you're
adding these, you're

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:10.820
going to do four reactions,
one with dideoxy ATP spiked in,

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:15.860
one with dideoxy TTP,
one with dideoxy CTP,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.280
and the last with dideoxy GTP.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.280
And because these
nucleotides are

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.360
present in different
positions along the sequence,

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.080
you're going to get distinct
banding pattern for each

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.700
of these reactions.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.500
But using that
banding pattern, you

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.200
can then read off the
sequence of DNA that's

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.850
present on the template strand.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.590
So this is how sequencing was
done for many, many years.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:50.030
These days, it's been
made cheaper and faster.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:54.750
And now what's often used is
next generation sequencing.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.090
And one the pain in the
ass about sequencing before

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.000
is you'd use a lot
of radioactivity.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.020
Your primer would
be radioactive,

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.280
so that you could
detect these bands.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.680
Right now, everything's done
using fluorescence, which

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.810
makes it much nicer, I think.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.940
And so in next
generation sequencing,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:18.140
your template DNA is attached
to a solid substrate, such

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.880
that it's immobilized on
some type of substrate.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:29.840
And then you add each of the
four nucleoside triphosphates.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.290
In this case, they're
labeled with a dye, such

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.660
that each one is
a different color.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.530
But the dye also functions
to prevent elongation,

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.500
such that, again, it's
this chain termination.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.330
When you incorporate
one of these,

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.150
the polymerase just
can't run along the DNA.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:50.300
It incorporates
one and then stops.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.720
So if you get your first
nucleotide incorporated,

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.060
it will incorporate
one of these four.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.330
And it will be fluorescent at
a certain wavelength, which

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:04.880
you can see using a
device or microscope.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.900
And then what you then do is
chemically modify this base,

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.300
such that you remove
the dye and allow it

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.910
to extend one more base pair.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.490
And so you go one
nucleotide at a time.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:20.480
And you read out the pattern
of fluorescence that appears.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.450
And that gives you
the sequence of DNA

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:27.230
on this molecule that's
stuck to your substrate.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.580
And you can do this in parallel.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:32.120
You can have tons, many
different strands of DNA.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.430
And you can be reading out
the sequence of each one

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:36.200
of these strands in parallel.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:39.560
Great.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.480
Any questions about
DNA sequencing?

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.700
OK.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.420
Very good.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.630
I will see you on Monday.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.620
Have a great weekend.

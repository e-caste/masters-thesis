00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:23.660
DUANE BONING: So
what I'm going to do

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.180
is pick up a little bit where
we left off from last time.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.210
Last time we were
talking, primarily,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.830
about full factorial models.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.650
And then we dealt with a few
important additional issues

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.730
in experimental design.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.320
So we were talking
about issues of blocking

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.470
against nuisance factors,
kind of a practical issue,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.030
but that also got us into
a generic issue that's

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.200
actually much more fundamental
and important of confounding.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.220
And I want to pick up on this
issue of confounding today

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.680
because very often you will
want to do fewer experiments

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.410
than a full factorial.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.160
That 2 to the k
grows very fast--

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.860
grows exponentially fast with a
number of factors, for example.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340
And so very often you
might ask the question,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.830
can I reduce the
number of experiments

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.490
and still get the key
information that I want to?

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.920
And so that's where
we'll really pick up

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.780
with fractional factorial
designs today and understanding

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.870
confounding and
aliasing patterns

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.410
that come with different subsets
of a full factorial design.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.000
Then we'll touch on
some implications

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.630
for model construction that fall
out pretty naturally from that.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050
And then start talking
a little bit, hopefully

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.920
if we have time, on process
optimization using some

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.190
of these kinds of
design of experiments

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.590
techniques and the models
that we're building.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650
So as I was saying,
very often we

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.120
want to run fewer than that
exponentially growing number

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.990
of experiments, even if
it's just to level, building

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.150
simple linear models.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.870
Again, we've got a 2 to
the k exponential growth.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.660
And, as an example,
imagine we said

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.380
we wanted to run less
than the full 2 to the k,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.850
say, for three inputs--

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.240
so for three inputs, if we
run the full 2 to the k.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.940
And we wanted to form a
full linear regression

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.300
model with interactions--
so it's still on quadratic,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.620
but it does have all
the interactions.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.740
This is what the
model looks like.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.630
And it's got, if
you count them up--

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.150
it's got eight coefficients.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.000
So if we were to do less
than the full 2 to 3

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.670
or 8 experiments, we
obviously would not

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.640
have enough data points to
uniquely fit every coefficient.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.000
So that's already giving
us the biggest clue.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.610
Is if you do less than
a full factorial model,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.130
then even for
linear experiments,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.220
you won't be able to fit
all of the coefficients.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.060
So what you end up having to do
is make a decision, a priori,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.660
that some of these factor
effects are going to be small.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.870
That is to say, we're going
to treat the coefficient

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.630
as essentially zero.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.370
But then what's
happening with the data?

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.840
What impact does that have
on other coefficients?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.660
So we can explore that slightly.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.850
Here's an example.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.560
We'll call this a 2 to
the 3 minus 1 experiment.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.790
And I'll talk about these half
fractions a little bit more.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.850
But instead of the full 2
to the 3 or 8 experiments,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.000
we'll do a half fraction here.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.210
We'll just do 4 experiments
instead of the 8.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.520
And so if I were to pick my
factor levels on x1 and x2

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.800
and then think about what the--

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.560
so I'm just doing--

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.460
in my mind, I might think if
I were just doing 2 factors,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:16.400
I would have a full
factorial on to 2 factors.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.980
And I also could calculate what
an interaction term would be.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.410
That's fine, that works well.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.660
I've got 4 coefficients
and a 2 factor experiment.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.950
And that I could uniquely fit
all of those coefficients.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.910
However, what if I were
to simply relabel that.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.180
And instead of thinking
of that as an interaction,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.710
what if instead I labeled
that an x3 column?

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.850
Then I could fit the linear
term for an x3 model.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.620
So imagine I was
doing a 3 factor,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.470
but only worried
about main effects.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.150
I wasn't looking
for interaction.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.150
I didn't care about
the x1, x2 interaction.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.710
If I did that, and just defined
x3 as if it were that column,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.670
then I've got a 3
factor experiment,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.630
but I can only see main effects.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.520
But you see what's
going on here,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.010
I still have that
interaction term.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.680
I still have an
x1 x2 interaction.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.040
So the key idea of confounding,
that we saw before,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.670
is lurking in here.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.360
If I were to do
truly a third factor

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.890
and set on my control knobs
for that experiment, my x3

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.830
according to these
high-low settings,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.390
those would also give
me the same information,

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.410
if you will, the same
combination settings for x1

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.350
and x2, that I would
have used to help

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.490
me detect an the interaction
between x1 and x2.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.010
That is to say, the
x1, x2 interaction is

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.900
confounded with a third
factor, if I were to do it.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.560
Just expanding on that a
little bit, if I were--

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.790
this should be a hat.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.610
There's another little
weird font thing going on.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.530
If I were doing a 3 factor
experiment, truly a 3 factor,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.100
I could build up to a
linear model OK with those 4

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.460
experimental parameters,
but I could not

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.590
fit any interaction terms.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.790
So I have a choice
in my model building.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.410
Do I take my three factors and
look for just main effects?

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.140
Or do I stick with
my two factors

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.860
and look for an interaction
effect and not model at all--

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.810
pretend the third
factor doesn't matter

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.320
or try to keep that constant
and not let that enter into it?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.630
Question--

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.486
AUDIENCE: If you
computed this [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:05.970
you still can't say
for sure that it

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.660
was x3 or [? x on ?] x2.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.466
So you describe it
[INAUDIBLE] you really

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.840
have no way of knowing, right?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.220
DUANE BONING: So if--

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.840
so the question-- by the way,
could we put the back screen

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.720
also to the slides?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.490
Great, thanks.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.730
So the question is, we
can still distinguish

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.375
x1, x2, and x3 or not?

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:34.070
AUDIENCE: No-- x3--

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.980
the effect that
we ascribe to x3--

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.560
x1, x2.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.803
So we cannot differentiate
between the two.

00:07:42.803 --> 00:07:46.100
Or [INAUDIBLE] might tell
us we have a huge effect

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.275
because of x3--

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:49.932
a significant effect.

00:07:49.932 --> 00:07:52.370
So we're not really
sure if it's x3

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.362
that's having an effect or
an interaction of x1, x2.

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:57.570
DUANE BONING: Yeah, you guys
may not have heard that,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.410
but basically, just
had the restatement

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.030
of exactly the issue.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.500
That it's confounding
between is it an x3 factor

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.610
or is it a beta 1,
2, x1, x2 factor.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.520
You cannot distinguish
between the two.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.310
AUDIENCE: So should
we do something

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.922
different to find that out?

00:08:21.922 --> 00:08:23.380
DUANE BONING: Yeah,
so the question

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.690
is what would you do then?

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:32.620
There's a priori knowledge
that may guide you to a belief

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.929
that there is no
interaction effect.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.803
That there's no
possible physical way

00:08:37.803 --> 00:08:39.970
there could be an interaction
effect, in which you'd

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.190
should be safe.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.620
Or you might be
trying to say, I'm

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.940
not even sure either of
these effects exists.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.170
And so I'm quite happy to
do just four experiments.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:09:00.370
Do an ANOVA that tells me
is either of those, just one

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.770
or two, significant.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.510
In which case, now
I worry-- maybe

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:10.150
then I add experimental
points to differentiate.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.340
So we've talked a little
bit more about that.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:18.070
But that's, in a nutshell,
the confounding and aliasing

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.680
thought process.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.510
And we'll look at
some rules of thumb

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:30.480
that would lead one to believe,
for example, that I may have,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.180
in many cases, more of an
a priori belief that maybe

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.300
the main effect will be
stronger and more important.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.340
And I doubt that the interaction
effect will be there.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.950
But those are kind of rule
of thumb and assumptions

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.500
that if you can do the
experiments, you can check.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.370
So the point out of
this was simply--

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.300
again, these should be models--

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.530
y hat models.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.910
For exactly the same
table of settings,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.270
if I looked at it one way,
I could build a model where

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.000
I've got some interaction term.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.830
Or I can look at
the main effect.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.720
Or I can give up--

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.720
so this could have been
the x3 main effect.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.950
Or similarly, I could
say, get confused

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.070
between some other main effect
and an interaction effect.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.210
In other words, I've got four
coefficients, four experiments.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.970
I've got some
confounding going on,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.490
but it's not clear actually.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.730
I've given you the
example for one of them

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.080
in the previous two slides.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.940
But the same thing
holds true for any

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.000
of the other interactions
with one of the main effects.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.040
So if I really
have three factors,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.620
I might really
have eight kinds--

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.910
in a linear model--

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.790
I might actually
have eight terms.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.110
And what I've done is
folded four of them onto

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.990
or confounded them with four
of the other coefficients.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.020
And so then the question becomes
what's confounded with what?

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.730
How do I structure and
how do I pick which

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.360
subset of experiments to run?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.710
So this is, essentially,
just saying the same thing.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.640
The point is we can
carefully pick which subset,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.630
in many cases--

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.990
this kind of a very small
experimental design.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.730
But in many cases,
we can pick which

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.510
subset of the rows
we want to take,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.940
which have a fraction
we want to do,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.920
based on our belief
in which interactions

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.000
are going to be least
likely or least important.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.310
So what we want to do is get a
little bit of a feel for that.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.500
So here's a little
bit larger picture,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.980
as well as now extending
some of our shortcut

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.470
techniques, our terminology,
our little factor algebra

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:15.340
that we've got for defining rows
and columns in our experiments.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.470
So if I were doing
a three factor

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:23.290
experiment, a full 2 to the 3
array, this is our x matrix.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.670
The identity column--
the C column--

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.060
you can sort of see I've--

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.640
all low, all high.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.090
And then within that, I've got
the B columns, low and high,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.190
low and high, low and high.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.170
And then within each of those,
low-high, low-high, low-high,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:40.670
low-high.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:45.550
So that's, again, all
16 of the possible--

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.780
excuse me, all eight of
the possible combinations.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.720
And then we can construct
our interaction terms.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.260
These are two
factor interactions.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.420
And then we've got a three
factor interaction as well.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.190
So that would be all eight
of our model coefficients.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:08.410
The column would tell me
how to form the contrasts

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:14.170
for detecting or estimating
each of those interaction

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.570
terms in the model.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.520
So that's just our baseline.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.800
And now let's consider
what happens--

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:33.420
let's think for this full
2 to the 3 experiment.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.100
If I were to only do
half of the experiments--

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.730
let's say I did the upper half--
the top four, the shaded four

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:48.870
experiments only, what happens
in terms of what coefficients

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.100
can we estimate?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.450
What ones can we not?

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.200
Please come on in.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.540
So which coefficients can I
estimate and which ones can

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.000
I not?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.310
And what's confounded with what?

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.870
We just got some
visitors filing in.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.360
I think there is, perhaps,
some bench space over there,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.770
as well, if you need some.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.680
So everyone in Singapore wave.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.670
Wave to our guests.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.170
Great.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.710
So if we do just this
upper half fraction here,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.180
let's look at a couple of things
that are immediately obvious.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.930
One that's really obvious here--

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.930
look at the C column.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.280
If we do those set
of four experiments,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.800
can you estimate what the
C effect is going to be?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.530
No, we haven't excited
that variable at all.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.670
It's all four experiments, we're
at the low setting of that.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.730
So it's clear, if I
picked those four,

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.923
I'm basically making an upfront
decision that the C effect--

00:15:04.923 --> 00:15:06.340
I'm not going to
be able to model.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.798
I'm not going to
be able to fit it.

00:15:07.798 --> 00:15:09.550
I'm not going to know
if it's significant.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:14.560
I'm not exercising
that variable in a way

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.360
with the right
combination of experiments

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:22.150
to unambiguously say,
yes, there was a C effect.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:28.750
So one way that we can describe
that in our funky DOE algebra

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:33.130
is to say that the C column
is equal to minus the identity

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.250
column.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.350
It's just minus 1 times
the identity column.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.680
And we can also look at
some of the other columns.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.790
And here's a neat one.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.370
Let's say-- let's look at this.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:53.560
The AC column, right
here, and the A column.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.240
And again, in our
funky algebra, you

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.270
can see already this
AC equals minus A.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.700
But if you look in one
to one correspondence,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:07.120
the AC column is exactly the
same, just with a minus sign.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.620
The same combinations
of levels as the--

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.740
both the A and the AC have
the same combinations.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.840
So that's confounding
or aliasing

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.400
between those two columns.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.980
So even if I run
this experiment,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.950
there's no way for
me to differentiate

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:33.520
whether it was a main effect, an
A effect, or an AC interaction.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.970
Now the other point here is
with just this selection, again,

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.970
of the top four
columns, the same thing

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.680
happens to other columns.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.110
What's the B column
confounded with?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.830
No, we've got some--

00:16:57.298 --> 00:16:59.590
somebody leaning against the
wall trying to stay awake,

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.090
I think.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.400
The disembodied
voice in the machine

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.869
said to tell you that
that's happened before.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.869
So the B column is
also confounded with--

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.310
let's see, what?

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.950
Minus 1-- this one.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.480
And then finally, the
last one is the AB column

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.740
is confounded with--

00:17:27.826 --> 00:17:31.520
let's see, that's just minus
1 of the ABC, it looks like.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.200
Do I have that right?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.150
Yeah.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.290
So that was our point here.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.630
If I had all eight
experiments, I

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.510
could have fit eight
coefficients in the model.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:48.140
But four experiments-- I can
only fit four coefficients.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.710
And it's more important than
just fitting four coefficients.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:57.800
It's really that I folded
together the effects of two

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.830
of those columns
into one coefficient

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.440
that I have to
assign either to--

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.330
sort of nebulously--
either to one

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.450
or the other of the main effect,
or the interaction effect,

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.520
or to some superposition
of the two.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.130
So this is just, basically,
saying the same thing.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.810
I'm just pointing out--

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.747
looking at the columns,
you can see that.

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:23.830
And if you were to actually
follow through and use

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.370
our contrast map for picking
out and detecting what

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:32.230
the contrast for effect A or
the contrast for effect AC

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.650
would be, they're essentially
the same contrast.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.450
The same sum of the output rows
for that particular effect.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.680
Now, we have a shorthand
way of describing

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.920
what this confounding pattern
is in our funky algebra.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.340
Which is to say, we equate
what columns are equal to what

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.620
columns.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:06.030
And then do a little bit of our
algebra of multiplying a column

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.270
factor or level
setting by each other

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.030
until we get down to
the identity column

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.930
on one side or the other.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.260
And then that becomes
a shorthand way

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
of describing what the whole
confounding pattern is.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.990
So for example, I can
pick, actually, almost any

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.090
of these confounding patterns.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.470
Looking at the AC in
the A column, where I

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.840
detect that the AC and the A--

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.330
this was the A column is equal
to minus of the AC column.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.460
Now if I multiply both
sides by the A column--

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.230
A times minus AC--

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.990
then on a element
by element basis,

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.470
if I take the A column there
and multiply it by itself,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.690
every minus 1
multiplies by minus 1.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.240
And I get the identity.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.030
Over here I've got
A times a minus A.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.950
And that also
becomes the identity.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.910
And I end up with just the
I equals minus C. Which

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.240
I could have also looked
right directly at the column

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.780
and said, OK, what is
aliased with the identity?

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.110
But also so you get a little
familiar with that funky column

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.830
math.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.470
So that, basically,
is a shorthand way

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.810
of either describing the
interaction effect or more

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.600
usefully, if I
knew up front what

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.170
interactions I was willing to
confound with what effect--

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:48.410
If at the start I said, I really
believe that the BC interaction

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:54.170
is going to be minor compared
to some other effect,

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.020
then I could use that to
actually help guide which

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.310
half of the experiment to pick.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.480
So for example, I could
have picked this half

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.790
or I could have
picked this half.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.750
And each one of those would have
been consistent half fractions.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.350
And the choice of what
to pick depends on--

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.840
for example, do I think
AC is an alias with A,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.820
maybe, because AC
really shouldn't

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.800
be interacting with each other?

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.480
I'm happy to do that.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.850
But the AB interaction,
I might actually

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.900
be wanting to detect that I'm
willing for that to confound

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.860
with the B factor
because I think that that

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.745
may be less important.

00:21:39.745 --> 00:21:41.120
AUDIENCE: Just
seems to be asking

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.140
that A is a processes pressure
and that C is the temperature--

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.610
for sure temperature.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.320
So in that case, the
interaction between pressure

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.920
and temperature, AC,
if temperature is high

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.870
and pressure is
low with the same,

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.340
the interaction would
be the same as A?

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.745
Because that A is equal to AC.

00:22:00.745 --> 00:22:01.495
DUANE BONING: Yes.

00:22:05.508 --> 00:22:08.050
AUDIENCE: It will just change
one parameter, just temperature

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.563
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:08.563 --> 00:22:09.980
DUANE BONING: But
what it's saying

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.760
is that your model, then,
for what the A affect was,

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.800
wasn't purely an A affect.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.890
It had a little bit of the
interaction lurking in it.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.770
So when you actually
run that experiment,

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.930
if there is an
interaction, you can't

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.010
tell whether it was due to
the main effect of pressure

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:36.570
or also because of some
interaction with temperature.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:44.180
So it's not that you get both or
you only get one or the other,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.980
it's that they're
mixed together.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.160
They're confounded together.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.410
So I alluded to some of the
ideas of how you choose which

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.210
design, based on what
confounding you're

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.650
willing to live with.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:05.790
But there's also a few
additional guidelines

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.020
that are at work.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.455
One is, there's this idea of
balance and orthogonality--

00:23:11.455 --> 00:23:13.080
that I'll talk about
in just a minute--

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:19.290
that tells us you can't just
willy nilly pick random rows

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:24.420
out of your matrix and be able
to use our design experiments

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.470
and that analytic techniques.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.300
Things like the estimation
of the effects and so on only

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.040
apply if I've got balanced
and orthogonal experiments.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.620
And that leads, also,
a bit, to this idea

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.540
or very closely
related to the idea

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.780
of getting enough
excitation of the inputs.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:52.370
So going back to our 2 to
the 3 full table here--

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.470
this idea of balance,
first off, says

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.880
that in whatever subset
of the design that you've

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.700
got for the factors that
you're interested in,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.570
you want all of the columns to
have an equal number of plus

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.150
and minus signs.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:16.400
Now, we saw if I did the
upper fraction for C,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.710
if I was trying to
deal with C, that's

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:23.390
not balanced because I've got
four low settings and zero

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.050
high settings.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:29.700
I have not at all
excited that input.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.400
But if you think back
to all of our algebra

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.393
for dealing with
contrasts and being

00:24:34.393 --> 00:24:36.810
able to take the average of
this, and the average of that,

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.810
and subtract the two
with the contrast,

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.390
that's basically
the reason that we

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.660
need this idea of
balance between the high

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.850
and the low settings for
that particular factor.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.300
So to use our
shorthand approaches,

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.340
you need an equal number
of the plus and minus signs

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.410
in each of the
columns that you are

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.150
trying to use in your model.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.430
Turns out you can relax
that a little bit if you

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.740
do some regression approaches.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.350
There's some other
risky, nasty things

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.620
that happen like
you may not have

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.530
the same amount of
variance or residual error

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.770
at different points
in your experiment.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.900
But especially for the
shorthand approaches,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.310
you have to have this
notion of balance.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:29.210
The second idea
is orthogonality,

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.570
which is basically
saying that what I need

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:38.810
is for the sum of the product,
element wise product of two

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.110
columns, to sum up to 0.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:46.320
So for example, here,
the column A and B--

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.210
this is a product of one--

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.300
product minus 1, product
minus 1, product of 1.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.670
Those sum up together to be 0.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:58.270
The A and B columns
are orthogonal.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.910
Which is another way of saying
those two columns are not

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.050
confounded with each other.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.190
So think in a linear
algebraic sense.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.320
If the two vectors
are orthogonal,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.550
they are not mixing
together effects in any way.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.330
So if I have two
columns that I want

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.120
to be able to model
separately and not

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.880
have the coefficient
trying to mix in randomly

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.390
some amount of one or
the other, but, in fact,

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.900
to be identified with
that particular effect,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.070
those two columns
have to be orthogonal.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.020
So for example,
what that's telling

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.690
me is if I were to pick
this upper half fraction,

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.840
the A and the B
columns are orthogonal.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.190
They are not confounded
with each other.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.180
They are two main effects
that, at least with respect

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.730
to each other, are separable.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.610
You could ask that same question
now to our other confounding

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.480
patterns.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.220
What did we say?

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.390
A is confounded with BC--

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.670
was it?

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.950
So A and BC--

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.450
are those two orthogonal?

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.040
Certainly, we know
by confounding,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.165
they're not supposed to be.

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:18.430
And if you do that product
of sums, each one of those,

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.560
I believe--

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.060
AC, sorry.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.010
Good-- I was about
to say, that's weird.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.390
They look orthogonal.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.470
There we go.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.470
Each one-- the product
is minus 1 every time

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.060
they all sum up to minus 4.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.010
They're not orthogonal.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.250
They are mixing in together.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.530
So those are a
couple of these ideas

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.750
of balance and
orthogonality that

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.030
are in some sense the same--

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.820
just another terminology for
talking about the same thing

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.870
that we've already built
up some intuition about.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.910
So I think we've already
just went through that.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.540
So if I were, in
this experiment,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.890
doing a half fraction and
picking the upper column,

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:07.120
you can see things like A
and B are balanced, C is not.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.740
So I can't try to put
that into my model.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:17.650
A, B, and C are orthogonal.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.680
Let's see, is that right?

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.420
Yes-- so if I were--

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.720
except I'm already knowing
I better not try model

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.580
C because I don't have
sufficient excitation in there.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.430
But I could also then
ask, OK, what else

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.780
is confounded with each other?

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.410
And if there are places where
I don't have orthogonality,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:40.660
I might then be led to is
there a different half fraction

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.730
that I might want to pick.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.580
One might be this lower one.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.740
I've already looked
at the upper half.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.220
But couldn't there be other
meaningful combinations?

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.110
And the answer is yes.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.810
So for example,
here's a better subset

00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:01.990
if I were looking for a
particular property that was

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.330
annoying with the previous one.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:08.500
In particular, this fact
that I can't even model.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.975
I'm not even exciting
a main effect.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.540
That feels weird.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.360
So a better half
fraction, then, at least

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.360
lets me look at main effects.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.810
Might be this shaded
blue half fraction.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.670
Now look what's going on.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:32.770
All three columns A,
B, and C are balanced--

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.370
just the shaded blue parts.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.860
So I've got equal
numbers of high and low,

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.950
each of A, B, and C are
mutually orthogonal.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.990
I still have
confounding going on.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.400
I'm not sure quite
exactly what this means.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.670
I guess A-- let's see.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:05.280
I still have confounding
because, for example--

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.020
So A is not orthogonal
with what column here?

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.966
BC in this one.

00:30:13.966 --> 00:30:16.720
Because 1, 1 minus--

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.820
so these are the same.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.540
So these two columns are
confounded with each other.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.280
So those are not
mutually orthogonal.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.160
And I could ask, OK,
what is a shorthand

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.457
way of describing this?

00:30:30.457 --> 00:30:32.040
I could pick a couple
of these columns

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.260
and say A equals BC and do,
again, my funky algebra.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:42.390
Multiply both sides by
A and get I equals ABC.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.580
And there's my
defining relationship

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.510
for what's confounded with what.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:52.420
Could also look up here,
again, and ABC is exactly--

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.120
for the blue-- for that subset--

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.070
for the blue element
is confounded

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.350
with the orthogonality matrix.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.750
What might be better about
this design or this subset

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.670
than the previous one?

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.100
Depending on what you're
looking for in the--

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.730
what's better about this?

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.590
Here we have, I guess,
shorthand for us--

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.510
what the other aliases are.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.000
Again, we expect to have
four aliases because I'm only

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
doing four experiments.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.500
What do you see
about these aliases?

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
high and low values

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.880
for all the main effects
and one only third order,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.100
like ABC, is the one that
you have not excited at all,

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.520
it's the one that [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.590
DUANE BONING: Good--
so that's at least two

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.460
of the three properties that I
really like about this design.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.930
If everybody didn't hear
it, he said, at least

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:58.150
you're exciting A, B, and
C. Second, the only column

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.700
that you're not exciting
at all is a third order

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.520
interaction, which is fine.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.440
How likely is a third
order interaction?

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.000
We'll chat about that
a little bit more.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.715
There's another
additional effect.

00:32:09.715 --> 00:32:14.300
There's another additional
really nice characteristic

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.994
about looking at these
aliasing patterns here.

00:32:17.994 --> 00:32:20.050
AUDIENCE: Like, A
is [INAUDIBLE] BC

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.480
so they're not measuring
exactly the same amount.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.130
DUANE BONING:
Right, they don't--

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:26.570
I don't know quite what--

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.480
don't overlap is a nice
way of describing it.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.290
I've got a main effect
that is confounded

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:43.280
with an interaction of somebody
else's second order term.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.750
So it kind of gets around
that discomfort with A

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.430
being compounded with AC
that you were describing.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.080
Now, I still have to worry about
it because if any second order

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.660
effects are out there, if
AC is still active, now

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.540
I'm not confusing it
with A main effect.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.900
I am confusing though
with the B main effect.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:12.690
But the nice thing is now I
can- you'll see it a little bit

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.190
later--

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:18.620
I can also appeal to
some physical causality

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.910
to also talk about the
likelihood of it being

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.180
a main effect or an interaction
effect, when I finally

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.240
analyze my overall experiment.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.950
What am I saying?

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.050
Here's the peek forward at that.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.330
If I were to find that this--

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:42.530
either the B main effect or
the AC interaction is at work,

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:47.270
but I also did an ANOVA
and I found out already

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.850
that this was not
significant, in other words,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.500
they're not an A main
effect, it's highly unlikely

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.830
that there's an
interaction with A.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.870
If it doesn't have
an overall effect,

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.570
why would it have a
subtle interaction.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.030
It's kind of unlikely.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.910
So by ordering
this, you actually

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.150
can start to decode what's
going on in the process

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.070
with a little bit
better visibility.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.489
So what we're actually
talking about here

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.560
there is some
additional terminology

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.350
for which is design resolution.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:30.330
It's basically a characteristic
of the aliasing patterns

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:36.060
and how decoupled you are able
to get between main effects

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.030
and interaction effects or
second order interactions

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.739
with other
interactions, and so on.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:46.530
And you will hear, sometimes,
description of particular half

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:51.150
fraction or other
experimental designs, DOEs,

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.679
as being resolution three, or
resolution four, resolution

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:56.790
five.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:01.440
And a resolution three
is a weaker ability

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.600
to discern than a higher
resolution in your experiment.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:12.960
But a resolution three is
nice in that no main effect--

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.450
an A factor is alias
with another main effect.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:23.660
So A is not alias with B.
But you will have main factor

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.480
and other interaction aliases.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.070
Let's say you didn't want that.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.830
You might need to
build a more powerful--

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:35.270
do more experimental
combinations.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:38.810
And you could go to a resolution
four, which is essentially

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.530
designed as an experiment
where no main effect is

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.210
an alias with
another main effect.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.630
And I'm not even
aliasing any main effect

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.350
with its second
order interaction.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.550
I might be so worried that there
are second order interactions

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.790
that I have to
make sure that I do

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.150
enough experimental points to be
able to detect them separately.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:04.520
Do an ANOVA on significance
of each of them separately.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.540
The example that we did just
a second ago, what resolution

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.170
do you think that is?

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.470
It's only resolution three.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.080
We were clearly
seeing interaction

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.030
with the second order effect.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.390
If I wanted to get to resolution
four, what would I need to do?

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.160
It's the full
factorial, in this case.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.410
I'd have to go to
the full 2 to the 3.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:30.220
I couldn't pick a half fraction.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.420
So if there were
four factors, it

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:39.070
turns out you get 16 columns.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.040
And now I can pick 16 rows.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.390
I can pick up 16
columns and rows.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:48.420
But I can pick, now, some
subset if I did a half fraction

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:54.150
and still achieve a resolution
four if I wanted to.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.860
So this is just looking
back, again, at the column.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.170
Again, the main effects are
aliased with interactions only

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.260
in this defined experiment.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.650
And that, you will sometimes
see referred to as a 2

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.490
to the 3 minus 1 sub resolution
three experimental design.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.890
So now, if you see the
shorthand notation there,

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.820
you look and go, oh, that's a
half fraction because it's a 2

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.320
to the 3 minus 1.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.270
And it's resolution
three, telling you

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.571
something about the aliasing.

00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:24.988
AUDIENCE: In the
previous chapter,

00:37:24.988 --> 00:37:26.944
is the difference
between resolution 4

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:32.582
and 5 both have no [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:32.582 --> 00:37:34.290
DUANE BONING: So there
was a subtle point

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:39.480
in here, which is no main effect
interacts with a second order

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.500
interaction.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.960
But I might have a
second order interaction

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.040
aliased with another
second order interaction.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.460
The resolution five says,
no second order interactions

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.525
are aliased with any other
second order interactions.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.310
So here we've been talking
about half fractions--

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:07.470
2 to the 3 minus 1, especially
as the number of factors

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.370
gets large.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.650
Let's say I have a design--

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.500
I'm designing a process and
it's got eight different control

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.010
knobs.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.960
That's a 2 to the
8th experiment.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.630
That's an awful lot of
different combinations.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.770
I might not want to just go
down a 2 to the 8 minus 1.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:28.290
I might want to do even
lower half fractions.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:34.000
For example, if
I cut it in half,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.390
and then cut it in half again,
that's a quarter fraction.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:39.250
I'm only picking a quarter
of the full factorial.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.850
And again, there
would be a resolution

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.200
associated with that.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.450
You could look and see what is
the aliasing pattern with that.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.820
And as you get to the
higher order models,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.200
you will often see
increased half fractions

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.290
in early parts of
experimental design

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:02.520
where you're just trying to see
are the main factors important.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.480
And might there be some
second order effects,

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.400
some second order interactions,
at least detecting

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.690
whether they exist.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.190
And then if they
do, you'll often

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.740
then go back in and start
filling in the other parts

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.045
of the experiment.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.010
Here's another half fraction.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:26.690
Trying to think-- this
is, again, for our 2

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.830
to the 3 minus 1.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.260
This is a different set of four.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.290
It's just got a different
defining relationship.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.820
And you could, again, ask, in
this case, is that-- number

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.950
one, is that a
legitimate half fraction?

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.910
Could I legitimately pull
these four columns out--

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:44.750
four rows out?

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.580
What kind of balance do I have?

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.110
What kind of orthogonality?

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.300
Or what's aliased with what?

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.000
And you can either
do it by looking at--

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.620
you can detect or
decide what are

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.430
the aliases by
looking at the columns

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.430
or simply doing your
little math down here

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.840
from the defining relationship.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.240
So if I start with I
equals AC and say, OK,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.740
what's aliased with C?

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:22.685
So I do C times I equals CA C
equals A because the C times

00:40:22.685 --> 00:40:25.300
C is the identity, and so on.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.410
And similarly, I
could say, OK, if I

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.950
start with I equals
AC multiplied by B,

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:35.970
I get B equals ABC.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.030
There's that.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.920
So there's a main effect
aliased with the third order.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.180
That's not too bad.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.950
I don't really like that
A aliasing with C. That's

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:51.150
not even a resolution
three experimental pattern.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.200
So I'd be very
careful in using this

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.930
unless I really
believed, strangely,

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.660
that C was not going
to have a main effect

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.980
but I might be worried
about it or interested in it

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:10.470
for the purposes of
looking for interactions.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.650
There is one other subtle place
where you might actually--

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.270
nope, never mind.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:23.840
I've already alluded to a
couple of ways of deciding what

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.400
aliasing pattern to choose.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.340
The most important one is your
knowledge of the process--

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.720
your experience
with the process.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.680
What factors are
likely to actually,

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.760
based on physical
causality, interact.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.850
But there are a few very
important rules of thumb

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.470
that are worth mentioning here.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.810
They are this idea of sparsity
effects, hierarchy of effects,

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:43.700
and inheritance.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.040
And we've already talked
qualitatively about them.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.630
But just to nail them down--

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:57.230
if I have eight factors, the
experimenter, you, likely

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:03.370
has a certain amount
of a priori knowledge

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:09.530
that there's an ordering and
likelihood of those effects.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.820
But it's also the case, I
have different eight factors

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.980
on my experiment,
it's highly likely

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.770
that they don't all equally
influence the process.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.880
Most processes have
a top few factors

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.760
that have most of the influence
or most of the effective.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.020
It's like a Pareto
type of a rule.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.540
So early on in
screening, in fact,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.170
you might be very happy doing
one of these half fraction,

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.090
quarter fraction, and so on.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.160
The purpose of
which is really just

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.420
to narrow down a really large
number of candidate effects

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.880
down to a smaller
number that you're then

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:55.280
going to model more accurately
and look for interactions

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.130
among those large effects.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.640
So this sparsity
of effects is one

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.330
of the things that's at work
in early screening experiments

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.225
and is a good rule
of thumb a rule

00:43:08.225 --> 00:43:13.270
or a generic effect to be
able to take advantage of.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.950
The second one is this notion of
hierarchy, which is basically--

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.770
again, these main
effects are usually

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.780
more dominant than
second order effects,

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:29.530
which are more dominant than
third order interactions.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.300
Furthermore, usually
you have to--

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.330
not have to-- but
usually, you will

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:44.170
see that the main effect or
the lower order interaction

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.340
has to be at work before you
have substantial interactions

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.940
with some other factor.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.440
So it's going to be rare
for you to have a big AB

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.560
effect and no main effect with
A and no main effect with B.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.970
So that's another rule
that you can often use.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:08.800
And the likelihood of
having these very high order

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.540
interactions--

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.990
the idea that you will have an
extra delta in an eight factor

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:18.460
experiment attributable to
exactly the combination of all

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.220
of those settings
being important

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.260
or large enough to be
important is pretty small.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.860
And then, I guess, I've actually
mixed in the inheritance here

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.360
already.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.130
This idea that I really
need both of these factors.

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.730
So the hierarchy
is really just more

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:40.290
saying the size of the
effect, schematically pictured

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.970
by the size of these boxes.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.290
The main effect
tends to be larger.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:48.870
And then the inheritance is I
kind of need the lower order

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.100
interactions be at work.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:58.220
So here's just some
additional examples

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.070
in the context of
half fractions.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.540
We've already almost
exhaustively explored the 2

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:11.960
to the 3 minus 1 resolution
three kind of picture.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.180
Here's an example
defining relationship

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.310
for resolution four.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.310
And here, you really have
to get up to four factors

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.310
before having
enough leeway to be

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.940
able to have that kind
of an interaction pattern

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.790
where I would only have--

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.160
so, for example, now
if I did the algebra,

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.790
A would be confounded with BCD.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:43.130
Or if I multiplied AB on
one side, AB is equal to CD.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.930
So that was the
earlier question.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:49.310
There you can see, a two-factor
effect or two way interaction

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.220
is confounded with another
two way interaction.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.160
But all main effects
are only compounded

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.643
with three way interactions
and none with each other.

00:45:59.643 --> 00:46:01.560
And here would be an
example you can play with

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:06.570
to see what the aliasing pattern
would be with a resolution five

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.975
kind of experiment.

00:46:09.975 --> 00:46:15.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the 4 minus 2 design--

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.683
is that-- would that
have-- what's the identity?

00:46:18.683 --> 00:46:19.850
DUANE BONING: I think that--

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.770
the identity-- I don't
remember offhand.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:33.090
I think we've got, actually,
an example right here that

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.946
shows what the aliasing
pattern would be.

00:46:36.946 --> 00:46:40.430
You asked exactly the question.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.740
And so we can work it out.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.670
So here's an example.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:47.540
First off, we already
know it's probably not

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:52.680
going to be a defining
relationship like this one

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.220
because I've only got 2 to the
4 minus 2, which is 2 square.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:02.870
I've only got four experiments
out of the 16 that I'm picking.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:05.600
So I've got an awful lot
of confounding going on.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.430
And the question would
be, I can actually

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.820
build it and look and see what
the confounding pattern would

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.490
be.

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:17.660
And in particular, I might
want to pick it such a way

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.650
that I want to at least be able
to detect the four main effects

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.230
and lots of other things
could be aliased in with that.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.600
So I could build it a
priori and say, OK, I'm

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:36.800
willing for A to be aliased
with that and with that.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.700
So in this case, when you've
got a double half fraction

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:47.760
I'm going to have aliasing be
between more than two columns.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.620
Now I actually have multi-way
aliasing between three columns.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.555
So in essence, what I've got
is something like A equals BC,

00:47:56.555 --> 00:47:59.690
D equals ABC.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:06.020
And then you can work that
out as I is equal to ABCD.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:11.120
In this case, is equal to BC.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.860
So it still has this
defining relationship,

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:22.460
but I'm now only picking
four of the rows.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.850
So I don't know if
you guys can see that.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.440
It's kind of tiny.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.410
But this is all 16
of these columns.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.750
And, again, this is
the same combination

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.300
that I just went through before.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.040
If you look, the A column here--

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:41.210
these four-- minus
1, minus 1, 1,

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:46.150
1 is now aliased
with both the BCD--

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:54.590
where'd that go-- the BCD minus
1, minus 1, 1, 1, and the ABC

00:48:54.590 --> 00:49:01.400
column, minus 1, minus 1, 1, 1.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.900
So if I do that, I have folded
two other columns onto it

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.435
in order to get down to
the full half fraction.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:16.280
And you can also explode
out in the other direction

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.850
and see what are all of the
interactions and aliases that

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:23.570
go on, again, either
looking at the columns--

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.220
and here, I've
shaded the columns

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.286
that are alias with each other.

00:49:27.286 --> 00:49:29.300
So in each case,
we've got all four.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.000
Or you can do the column math.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.450
And this has another
nasty effect,

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:42.950
which is those four columns
are not even resolution three.

00:49:45.885 --> 00:49:47.510
So going back to your
earlier question,

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.590
I don't know what the defining
relationship is for a 2

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.080
to the 4 minus 2
resolution three.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.900
I'm not sure what the
defining relationship is.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.130
Sounds like a good
problem set problem.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.880
Remember that one.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.740
So I think we've
explored aliasing.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.180
Do you understand aliasing?

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.460
Any questions on the aliasing?

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.590
Confounding?

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.240
There is one more
aspect to it that I

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.980
want to explore a
little bit, which

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.490
is, what are the implications
for model construction?

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.440
We've already alluded to this.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.440
So let's just sort
of work through it.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:33.230
But also, folding in and
remembering interaction terms,

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.630
but also, potential
higher order terms

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:41.090
and some implications that
arise if-- some of my factors,

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.900
I think, might have
quadratic elements to it.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.190
You get, actually, then
complicated aliasing patterns

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.550
in those cases.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:56.630
So a simple case, when I just
got one input and I've got one

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.740
output, but I think there
might be a quadratic effect,

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.830
what we're seeing here is that I
cannot do just a two level full

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.020
factorial to exercise that.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.970
As we talked about
last time, I have

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:11.390
to add some kind of a
center point or some other--

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:13.850
I really need all three
data points in order

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:17.600
to be able to fit
a quadratic term.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.160
And we talked last
time about being

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.490
able to do ANOVA
residual analysis

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:29.450
to differentiate whether
that deviation compared

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:35.430
to spread within a replication
error is significant.

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:40.640
So I could decide whether that
coefficient is significant

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.210
or not.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:47.330
If I were generalizing this
now, to more than one factor--

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:53.750
last time we talked about
a two factor example.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.760
And we had up to
second order terms.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.380
But if we expand this
out to a full quadratic

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.530
with all of the
interactions, what you see

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.940
is a very rapid explosion in
the number of coefficients.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.110
Because I've got
my main effects--

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.650
so this is still
just two factors,

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.700
but now tree level-- a full
factorial in three levels.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.200
I've got my average.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.340
I've got my main effect.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.810
I've got my interaction
between x1 and x2.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:32.790
But then I've got, also, x1
squared and my x2 squared.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:38.090
And then I've got the
interaction between x1 squared

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:42.180
and x2, x1 and x2 squared.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:47.675
And if both of the
terms were squared,

00:52:47.675 --> 00:52:50.100
the question is, do I have--

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.460
this is what the full
quadratic model with all

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.260
of the interactions would be.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.400
Do I have enough data to
be able to fit this if I

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.930
did a three squared problem?

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:06.490
Why not?

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.000
How many coefficients
do we have?

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.463
AUDIENCE: You have one extra.

00:53:17.463 --> 00:53:18.880
DUANE BONING: Do
I have one extra?

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.160
One, two, three--

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.780
I have nine coefficients.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.540
How many experiments
is three squared?

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.450
Nine experiments--
so it's exactly

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.880
like what we saw with
the two experiments.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:36.430
I have exactly, just barely,
the number to perfectly fit.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:38.950
So actually, if I do the
regression formulation,

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.720
which I think is coming--

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.740
ew, nasty-- think
these are supposed

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.810
to be vertical dot, dot, dots.

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.486
And these are supposed to be
horizontal dot, dot, dots.

00:53:49.486 --> 00:53:51.580
Weird font problem here.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:56.470
If I were to actually formulate
this for the three factor,

00:53:56.470 --> 00:54:00.100
I would have exactly the
same matrix relationship.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.160
And I have exactly the same
number of rows and columns.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.550
And I would be
able to fit that--

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.110
I guess that doesn't
come till later.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:10.360
I could solve that
directly and get

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.260
beta is equal to x minus 1--

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.940
my output.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.400
But I don't have
any replicate data.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.190
If I had replicate
data, then I would also

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:26.230
need to do the pseudo
inverse exactly as before.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.290
So the point the
point here is if you

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:34.020
want to build every possible
model in the full quadratic,

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:39.230
I have to have a full factorial
in three levels, as well.

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:47.632
So we can meaningfully talk--

00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:49.090
although you don't
see it that much

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.790
in the literature and
we'll see why in a moment,

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:56.000
you can talk about full
factorial more than two levels.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.430
I'm talking about
full factorial 3

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:02.300
to the k, where you've
got three levels per test.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.050
But what you will see and I
want to touch on a little bit,

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:08.050
are slightly
different designs that

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:10.330
have a couple of
additional properties

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:13.090
that might be a better
way to go than starting

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:17.650
a priori with the full
tree level factorial,

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:22.270
doing every possible
combination of all three levels.

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:25.690
But rather, start with
the two level experiment.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:32.320
And then if you start to see
some important interactions

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.360
or some indication
that additional effects

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.950
are needed, adding experimental
design points incrementally

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.400
when it's easy to do that.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.630
It's not always easy to do that
in your experimental setting.

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:45.860
AUDIENCE: How would
you detect that?

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.680
Would you say other--

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.060
observe other effects?

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:54.220
DUANE BONING: Yes, so if I
do purely the corner model,

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:58.120
is it possible for me to detect
if there might be curvature?

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.100
No.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.750
So the first thing I would
do, if I wanted to detect,

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:05.710
is at least add
some center points.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.510
And certainly, for
continuous parameters

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:09.500
we talked about last
time, that makes sense.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.740
It doesn't make sense
for discrete parameters.

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.110
Really, curvature is only
a term that makes sense

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:15.450
with a continuous parameters.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.160
So that's kind of the
domain I'm talking in here.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.600
So in fact, my rule
of thumb is I always

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:27.010
have at least the center
points in my original design.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:30.400
I never do just a pure
two level factorial.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.900
I always add at least the center
points because they tell me--

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.850
and I try to replicate at
least the center points

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:43.420
so I can distinguish between
curvature and I can also, then,

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.910
not fit exactly perfectly
every interaction,

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.310
but I can also start
to ask questions

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.650
about the significance
of these effects.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:54.770
Then I've got some indication
that there might be curvature.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.930
Now I might go in and start
to say, OK, there's curvature

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.000
but I don't really
know the nature of it.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.160
Now I want to add these three
level points on more than one

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.920
of the experimental factors.

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.300
That's where I might then add
even more experimental points.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:18.670
But I'm always shocked
because a few of the books--

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:21.640
you read Montgomery,
[INAUDIBLE],,

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.260
you read most of the
experimental design books.

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:29.860
They rarely talk and emphasize
the value of the center point.

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.570
It's just absolutely
crucial in my mind.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:40.600
I always want to add at
least that off corner--

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.030
one off corner point.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.290
And preferably some
replicates of that

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:48.220
because it gives you
so much more power.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.450
And think about it.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.340
If I'm doing four
factors, I'm only

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.260
adding one more
experimental combination.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.620
I'm not exploding
out the whole design.

00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:01.150
It's a very cheap way
to learn an awful lot

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:02.820
more about your experiment.

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.490
So this is simply
making the point.

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:14.040
We just looked at
the 3 to the 2 case--

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.195
how many coefficients there
are in the full model.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:26.580
In particular, if we do the
full model quadratic 3 to the 2,

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.750
we already got
nine coefficients.

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:30.180
But if I add just
one more factor

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:34.950
and I'm still worried
about the full model

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:38.700
with all of the
interactions, the number

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:43.560
of experiments that I need
to do explodes rapidly.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:48.225
Up here with only five
factors, I got 243 model terms.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.530
Do you really think each of
those model terms is going

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:58.610
to be nonzero significant?

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:02.300
Probably not-- so this is
also a wonderful opportunity

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:06.050
for saying, sparsity of effects,
hierarchy, all of those--

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:08.690
I'm going to alias some
of those in and discount

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:09.950
certain interactions.

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:16.730
And in fact, if I just do main
effects and the third order

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:21.510
term, but only on
the single effect.

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:25.940
So an x1 squared--

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.750
second order term, quadratic
model, x1 squared, and x2

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.030
squared, and so on--

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:35.690
then it only grows linearly
with the number of factors.

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:41.870
If I know a priori, I can
neglect those higher order

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.550
interactions.

00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:47.210
So this is just working
out and giving an example,

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.450
now using some of our
earlier terminology.

00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:56.720
Again, here I can refer to
the different combinations.

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.570
Again, I have my A and B. And
I can label the AB interaction.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:08.930
That's that AB interaction
or the AB effect

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.790
goes with the Beta 1, 2.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.320
This A2 is just an a squared, B
squared, A squared B, B squared

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.240
A, A square B squared.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:23.120
And you can, again, see,
now, the factor levels where

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.660
I've added 0 to indicate
the center level setting

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.210
for each of those.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.970
But we can also
borrow, and import,

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:36.620
and use all of the same
aliasing terminology

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.220
that we had earlier.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:42.900
So for example, if I only did--

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.100
I don't know a--

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:50.300
well, if I did a 3
to the 2 minus 1,

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.390
I guess that's a half fraction,
but kind of an odd one

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:58.880
because that means I
get to pick three rows.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.120
I could pick-- is that right?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.410
I think that is.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.450
You'd have a lot of
aliasing going on.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.810
So actually, it's not as easy
to talk about a half fraction.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.767
And in fact, we'll see--

01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:20.850
I can do these aliasing,
but I want to leap ahead.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.060
Here we go.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.640
A good way to try to
visualize these, which

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.410
works for lower
number of factors

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:30.020
because it's not too
high dimensional a space,

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:38.060
is actually plot out in your
x1 versus x2 experimental space

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.780
what design points you're
actually exercising

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.560
with some half fraction.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.870
So for example, in this case,
I'm just doing say, these 2/3

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.870
and leaving off this
1/3 of the experiment.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.070
In which case, what
I'm essentially doing

01:01:57.070 --> 01:02:00.340
is giving up and saying, I'm
not going to do the high level

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.400
setting on my x2 factor.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.650
And now you can start
to get a good feel,

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:08.140
nice intuitive feel
that goes together

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.640
with the mathematics,
of what you're

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.950
giving up when you do that.

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:14.560
If I were not doing
those experiments,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.190
I just picked this subset,
what model coefficients am

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:21.250
I detecting or am I
going to be able to fit,

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:25.800
and what am I not
in that experiment?

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.380
Should be pretty intuitive.

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:38.870
What model coefficient
would I not be able to fit?

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.958
Next to what?

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:46.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.260
DUANE BONING:
Yeah, for this one.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:52.220
No worries-- I said, we are
going to pick these six points.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.910
These are the six columns
going with these rows.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:03:00.800
But I'm not doing
those three experiments

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.436
in my x1 and x2
factor [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:10.290
Can I do a quadratic
model in x1?

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:13.690
Sure, I got three data points
projected along in that.

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:16.570
Can I do a quadratic
model in x2?

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:19.700
No, I'm only exercising
two different levels.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.660
So I can only go up to
linear in that term.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.220
And that's what I
mean by intuitive.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:29.890
I think you can start to see
what, at least main order

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:33.670
effects as well as second
order terms, are at work.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.250
It's a little more
subtle to see,

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:42.190
can I do an x1 and x2 or
an x1 squared and an x2?

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:45.100
I think you can see,
I've got combinations

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.050
to be able to do some
of those, but there may

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.612
be some confounding going on.

01:03:48.612 --> 01:03:50.320
And then you can look
back at the columns

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.960
to see what kind of
confounding may be occurring.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.000
So I haven't actually
done that on this

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.760
to figure out which is
confounded with what.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.798
But let's see-- anybody--

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:05.590
it's probably so tiny
you don't have a hope

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.570
in the world of seeing it.

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:08.290
There is one.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:15.730
B is equal to minus B
squared, in this case,

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.710
where B was my x2.

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:20.530
So this is basically
confounding and saying--

01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:23.980
I was telling you,
I could not fit

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.180
the B squared-- the
quadratic term in x2.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:32.140
If there actually is
curvature, where did it go?

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.470
It's hidden inside of
the B2 linear term.

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:39.340
It's confounded with
the B linear term.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.730
So it's the same
kind of terminology.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:55.440
Here's a different pattern
that looks almost the same

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.610
as the other one.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:02.226
I can still fit quadratic
in x1, linear in x2--

01:05:02.226 --> 01:05:04.890
in fact, it's not
even clear to me

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.500
right up front what I can't
fit with one or the other.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.780
I kind of like having the center
point in the other design.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.790
But now, what's the
difference between these two?

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:20.700
Actually, I think a lot of the
aliasing is relatively similar.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.250
I can think of one reason
why I might pick the lower

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.460
design over the upper design.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.930
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it make
the effect more pronounced?

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:33.500
DUANE BONING: Yeah, I
think that in combination

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.870
with what I was thinking,
but I think you're right.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.430
The statement was,
this would make

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.170
the effective more pronounced.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:44.270
I'm also thinking it explores
a larger space of x2.

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:48.590
This one is just zeroing
in or zooming in on the 0

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:49.830
to low setting.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:52.220
The other one goes all
the way and spans the low

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.580
to the high setting.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.870
So I'm exploring or fitting
around the larger portion

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.110
of the space.

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:04.010
So I might prefer, for
that reason, the lower one.

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.210
It doesn't have a
pure center point,

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:08.900
but it's not clear that
the other one does either.

01:06:11.762 --> 01:06:20.780
AUDIENCE: Is there [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.570
DUANE BONING: Yeah, so
the same idea is a balance

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:25.200
and orthogonality are at work.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.680
But again, it's mostly
with respect to--

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.865
it's more subtle
now because it's

01:06:31.865 --> 01:06:33.860
with respect to
either the linear term

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.130
or the quadratic term.

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:40.700
So these are both balanced
and orthogonal with respect

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.530
to things like the
main order effects.

01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:49.860
But not orthogonal B to B
squared in these two cases.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.590
So you can use the
same reasoning.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:55.220
But you've got
three levels, you've

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.470
got to expand it out
and think it's not just

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:59.810
the whole variable
or the interaction.

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:02.600
It's also the second
order term, possibly,

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.244
being nonorthogonal
with a lower order term.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.690
Here's another one.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:21.080
What do you think about that one
compared to the previous two?

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.240
This one looks
interesting to me.

01:07:34.114 --> 01:07:35.832
AUDIENCE: It's
going to be bigger

01:07:35.832 --> 01:07:39.515
because we can do
quadratic [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:39.515 --> 01:07:42.170
and since the combinations
are less-- they

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:45.910
have less effect [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:47.373
DUANE BONING: Yep--

01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:48.790
I'm not sure
everybody heard that.

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:52.780
But at least here, we're
exercising all three levels

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.990
of x1, all three levels of x2.

01:07:55.990 --> 01:08:00.430
So we can fit quadratic
terms in each of the cases.

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.610
Where we might need
to be a little careful

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:05.680
is we're actually making
an interesting trade

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.040
off here-- going back,
also, to your earlier point.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.210
We're giving up a little bit
of balance in this design.

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.270
In that for the
low setting of x1,

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:20.500
I've actually got more data
than for the high setting of x1.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.439
And so if there's
noise effects, I'm

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:27.100
actually fitting, in effect--

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.069
if you do the regression, you'll
have a narrower confidence

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:32.229
interval over here
at the low setting

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:34.069
than you would at
the high setting.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:36.859
So you actually have
to be a little careful.

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:38.920
You can do the regression math.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.019
You have to be careful
in forming your contrast.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.899
Normally, you get to
these high r models,

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:50.200
you're probably throwing it
into a regression anyway.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.600
But you also then have to be
careful in the interpolation

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.939
and use of the model in
different parts of the space

01:08:54.939 --> 01:08:56.529
because its accuracy
is a little bit

01:08:56.529 --> 01:08:59.109
different in different
parts of this space.

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:00.040
But I like this--

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:06.189
I kind of like this one is as
well, even with those caveats.

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:09.819
But you can still use this and
the same aliasing terminology

01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:13.420
to figure out which
coefficients I'm giving up.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:14.883
What's aliasing with what.

01:09:14.883 --> 01:09:17.300
And I'm not going to go through
that, but you can do that.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.300
AUDIENCE: Would you get
a higher [INAUDIBLE]??

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.550
DUANE BONING: Well,
it's not clear you

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:27.040
would get an overall
higher or lower r squared.

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:38.050
You almost always-- and we'll
do a little bit more regression

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:38.550
later.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:40.880
But you almost always,
if you add more terms,

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.359
you get a better r squared.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:46.189
But then the question
is, is it a fair model?

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:48.170
So we can also talk
about an adjusted r

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:52.130
squared where you penalize
for the additional model--

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:55.653
the additional model in terms.

01:09:55.653 --> 01:09:57.070
And then this is
just pointing out

01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:02.980
that you can still use
the linear algebraic--

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:08.860
either direct solution or quasi
inverse solution if you've got

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:12.860
replicates to be able
to fit the model.

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.210
So these are the sorts
of things that come out.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:19.720
This is for an x1, x2.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.880
I don't know which is which--

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.130
x1, x2.

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:27.483
If, in fact, there are
true quadratic terms,

01:10:27.483 --> 01:10:28.900
these are a little
different kinds

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.730
of surfaces than the
ruled surface, which

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.690
looked like it had kind of a
funky kind of curvature because

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:39.790
of an x1, x2 interaction.

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:43.690
But if I projected down
on any one variable,

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:45.100
it's always linear.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.360
Here, if I were to do a
slice holding x1 constant,

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.030
I do, in fact, get
a true quadratic.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:55.360
Now, the nice thing
about quadratic surfaces

01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:03.190
is you can start to think about
an optimal point much more

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:04.930
easily within these.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.470
Certainly, if the
space is large enough

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:13.120
to cover a minimum or a maximum,
there's a natural motion

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.450
if you're trying to minimize
or maximize your output

01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:20.290
y of finding the optimum space.

01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:22.480
Now, it's also possible
that if I had a smaller

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.770
space in the true
minimum or maximum

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:30.380
of the full equation where
outside, then I might have--

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.430
so for example, let's say
my space was constrained

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:36.280
to only right here,
then I might run

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.750
into the minimum or the maximum
at one of my boundaries.

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:43.090
But now we've got
this extra notion

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:45.580
that my min or maximum
might occur somewhere

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.800
in the interior of the space.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.540
As opposed to with
linear models,

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:54.340
it's always at one or the
other of the boundaries.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.860
So this starts to
get to the desire

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.470
for using this
kind of a model now

01:11:59.470 --> 01:12:03.580
to find the optimum point, which
is one of the main reasons we

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.260
do experimental designs.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.720
Not just to find out
which factors matter,

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.110
but build the model, and
then use it either in,

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:15.700
maybe, feedback control or
more often, just to set--

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.270
find the process settings or
find the design optimal point

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:21.295
in order to achieve
some criteria.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:27.160
Now, I alluded already to
adding additional points.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.180
If we did a full
factorial three level--

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.350
that's all nine
combinations of high-low.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:39.730
And in the x1, x2 space,
that's all nine points.

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:43.390
There is an alternative
approach and probably one

01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:46.670
of the most important
experimental designs

01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:48.940
after two level full factorial.

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.000
It's referred to as a
central composite design.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.060
And you often will design
up front to do this,

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:58.780
but also very often
it will be what

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.490
you extend a full factorial
corner point design with.

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:06.280
If I did my first
experiment with 2

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:14.820
to the 2, just pure full
factorial two levels,

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:20.540
and I got four tests, first
off, this is probably wrong.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.870
The model is shown
to have a poor fit.

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:28.400
If I actually did this for all
four points in the interaction,

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.310
I don't have enough
to detect that.

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:36.650
So somewhere in here
would be ad center points.

01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:38.950
The power of the center point.

01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:41.180
If you remember nothing
else from today,

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.010
the power of the center point.

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:45.740
The power of the center point.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.920
Then I can start to
detect whether it actually

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.190
has a lack of fit
in a formal sense.

01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:56.300
And let's say then I decide
I want to go quadratic,

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.330
but I'm not quite sure
of the shape where

01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:04.320
my min or maximum might be.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.880
What we often do is add
our additional points.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.890
So there was our original
four corner points.

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:15.920
Certainly, we wanted to
add the one at the center.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.810
Should have done that already.

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:22.460
But now I can also decide
where to add my interaction

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.060
points different-- so
let's say I added this.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:32.150
The full typical 3 to
the 3 would say, OK,

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:38.640
you add them at exactly
these 3 by 3 grid array.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.000
I would add them at the center
points of each of these.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.940
We can do something else
that's a little bit clever.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:53.070
Which is instead, add
these interaction points

01:14:53.070 --> 01:15:02.810
off the grid, but at the
location of an outer circle

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:07.970
equidistant or circumscribed
around the original points

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.340
of my cube-- my hypercube.

01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:17.590
See I think-- there we go.

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:19.950
So what we would do
in that case here,

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:22.770
is these would be my
first four points.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.090
I'd add my center point.

01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:28.800
And now I add these
points off axis.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.280
There's something really clever,
really valuable in doing this--

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.340
some things that are subtle, and
kind of mathematical, and not

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.440
all that important, but
some other parts that

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.790
are really nice and intuitive.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:43.490
I'll give you the subtle
mathematical part.

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:52.550
This actually maintains
a little bit of fitting--

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:54.500
if you go and you
do the regression,

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.990
the fact that all of
your off center points

01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:59.690
are now equidistant
from the center point

01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:04.680
means that your model variance,
no matter which direction you

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.430
go, is the same.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:08.490
In other words, there's
a confidence interval

01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:13.110
on your coefficients and an
interpolation or extrapolation

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:15.870
error that grows
as you go further

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.860
from the center of your design.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:23.690
And by doing this, that
maintains asymmetry.

01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:27.140
It doesn't matter which
direction you look.

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.940
You've got the
same model accuracy

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:32.810
purely as a function of
distance from the center.

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:36.660
So that's a nice
mathematical property.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:40.890
But there's another
more intuitive value

01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:42.390
picking these corner points.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.060
And the way I think
of it is if I just

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:53.080
picked those 3 by 3
on a regular grid,

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.800
I could then project
down to x1 or x2.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.520
And then in terms of
exercising the x1 variable,

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.700
I've only got three levels.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.520
Here, if I were to
project down my points--

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.870
so let me get rid of some
of this scribble here.

01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:15.430
If I were to project down
onto just my x1 axis--

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.930
let's say I did the
experiment and I

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:20.860
found that x2 actually
was not that important

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:25.150
and I project down
all of these points.

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:31.740
That means for my
x1, I've actually

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:38.120
exercised at five
different levels of x1.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.400
I've got more than just--

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.030
I've got extra
redundancy built in.

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:48.150
If I'm fitting just
a quadratic model,

01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:54.220
I've got ways to actually check
whether the quadratic model is

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:54.880
sufficient.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.030
I can do a lack of fit test
on even the quadratic model.

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:04.320
Whereas if I only had
exactly three samples of x1

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.390
and I add the
quadratic in, there's

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.730
no way for me to
ask the question,

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:12.140
might there be an
even higher order,

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.960
a logarithmic dependence,
or something else

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.540
that's subtle that's going on.

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:21.590
Because I fit exactly all
of the data that I have.

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:23.420
So the central composite
design, I think,

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:26.060
has this nice
intuitive feel of I'm

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:31.010
actually kind of exercising my
space a little more thoroughly

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:34.760
to be able to build a model
that can apply a little bit more

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.248
broadly.

01:18:36.248 --> 01:18:37.040
Everybody see that?

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:43.450
So here's what the central
composite would look like.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:47.110
What you end up with is the
original coroner points.

01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:48.970
You add the center point.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:53.710
And now you can see, if you
were to do the geometry,

01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:59.020
the distance there
is square root of 2.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:03.460
So I'm going a full one
on both the x1 and the x2.

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:08.390
And you can extrapolate that
to a third order hypercube.

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.990
I think it ends
up being, instead

01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:14.380
of square root of 2, that
distance is a square root of 3

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.230
and so on.

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:18.480
So you can find
what the distance is

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.890
and pick those
different corner points.

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:25.650
So what we'll do next time
is build on a little bit

01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:30.120
this idea of using the model.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.140
We built it.

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.370
We can assess it.

01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:35.190
We can pick our points to build
different orders of model.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:39.360
What we'd like to do is talk
a little bit about picking

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.500
one of these surfaces
and how I actually--

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.450
a couple of related,
but slightly different

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:53.100
ways of looking at optimizing
to find an optimum point either

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.410
after you've built
the whole model or--

01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:59.580
the clever thing here when
you're on a process line--

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.400
doing it interactively
or incrementally.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.760
Actually, picking your
design points almost one

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.510
at a time based on your current
view of the model driving

01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:11.470
towards the optimum.

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:13.740
So instead of doing all
your experiments up front,

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:17.340
you might actually want to do
them in an evolutionary way

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.240
to try to find the optimum.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.990
So we'll talk about both of
those approaches next time.

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:27.610
So again, the problem
set is due tomorrow.

01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:32.470
I think we'll hold off and we'll
give ourselves, Hayden and me,

01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:35.400
an extension on
issuing the new problem

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.440
set so you're not doubled
up, and we can think about it

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.120
a little bit more as well.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.480
And issue that
tomorrow, as well.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.320
We'll see you then on Tuesday.

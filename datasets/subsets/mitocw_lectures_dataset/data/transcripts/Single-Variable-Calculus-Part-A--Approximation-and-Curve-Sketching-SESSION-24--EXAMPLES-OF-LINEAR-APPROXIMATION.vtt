00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.330
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.670
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.700
In lecture you've been talking
about implicitly defined

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.540
functions and implicit
differentiation.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.370
So one of the reasons that
these are important is--

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.340
or that implicit
differentiation is important,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.750
is that sometimes you have a
function to find implicitly

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.270
and you can't solve for it.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.750
You don't have any
algebraic method

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.590
for computing the function
values as a formula, say.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.060
So, for example, this function
that I've written on the board

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.530
that I've called w of
x is defined implicitly

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.610
by the equation that w of
x plus 1 quantity times

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.910
e to the w of x is
equal to x for all x.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.630
So this function, some of
its values you can guess.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.520
Like at x equals 0,
the function value

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.920
is going to be negative 1.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.800
And the reason is that
this can't ever be 0,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.770
so the only way to
get this side to be 0

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.150
is if w is negative
1 if this term is 0.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.720
So some of its values
are easy to compute,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240
but some of its values aren't.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.910
So for example, if I asked
you what w of 3/2 is,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.280
it's very hard.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.730
There's no algebraic way you can
manipulate this equation that

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.590
will let you figure that out.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.390
So in that situation
you might still

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.780
care about what the
function value is.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.790
So what can you do?

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.170
Well, you can try and find
a numerical approximation.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.340
So in this problem I'd like you
to try and estimate the value

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.850
w of 3/2 by using a linear
approximation to the function,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.310
to the curve-- yeah.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.900
A linear approximation of
the function w of x in order

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.715
to compute this value.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:48.920
So as a hint, I've given you--

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.040
so you're trying to
compute w of 3/2.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.470
As a hint I'm pointing out
to you that w of 1 is 0.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.600
Right?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.250
If you put in x
equals 0 and w of 0

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.750
equals-- sorry-- if you put
in x equals 1 and w of 1

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.610
equals 0 on the
left hand side, you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.119
do indeed get 1, as you should.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600
So, OK.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.050
So, good.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.240
So that'll give you a
hint about where you could

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.820
base your linear approximation.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.700
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.930
take a few minutes to
work this out, come back,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.263
and we can work it out together.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.910
All right.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.520
Welcome back.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.960
So hopefully you've
had a chance to work

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.310
on this question a little bit.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.290
So in order to do this linear
approximation that we want,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.750
what we need to know are:
we need to know a base point

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.870
and we need to know the
derivative of the function

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.790
at that base point.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.220
And those are the
two pieces of data

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790
you need in order to construct
a linear approximation.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.260
So we have a good
candidate for a base point

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.910
here, which is the point (1, 0).

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.070
So this curve,
whatever it looks like,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.950
it passes through
the point (1, 0).

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.220
And that's the point we're going
to use for our approximation.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.150
So we're going to use
the linear approximation

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:23.370
w of x is approximately equal
to w prime of 1 times x minus 1

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.570
plus w of 1 when x is
approximately equal to 1.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.590
So this is the
linear approximation

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.010
we're going to use, and we
have that w of 1 here is 0.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.460
So this is, this is equal to w
prime of one times x minus one.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.290
Just, the w of 1 is 0.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.600
It just goes away.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.400
So in order to estimate w of
x, and in particular w of 3/2,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.215
what we need to know is we need
to know the derivative of w.

00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:01.640
OK?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.040
And to get the derivative
of w, we need to use-- well,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.530
we have only one piece
of information about w.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.240
Which is we have
that it's defined

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.510
by this implicit equation.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.254
So in order to get
the derivative of w

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.920
we have to use implicit
differentiation.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.600
OK?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.920
So let's do that.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.520
So if we implicitly
differentiate this equation--

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.540
so let's start with
the-- the right-hand side

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.012
is going to be really easy.

00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:27.642
Right?

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.600
We're going to differentiate
with respect to x.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.450
The right-hand side
is going to be 1.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.290
On the left-hand
side it's going to be

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.390
a little more complicated.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.559
We have a product
and then this piece,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.350
we're going to have a
chain rule situation.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.900
Right?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.170
We have e to the w of x.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.930
So, OK.

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:52.770
So we're going to take
an implicit derivative

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.380
and on the left-- so OK,
so the product rule first.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.840
We take the derivative
of the first part,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.060
so that's just w prime of x
times the second part-- that's

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.630
e to the w of x-- plus
the first part-- that's

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.620
w of x plus 1-- times the
derivative of the second part.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.880
So the second part
is e to the w of x.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.604
So that gives me an e to the
w of x times w prime of x.

00:05:24.604 --> 00:05:25.520
That's the chain rule.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.969
So that's what happens
when I differentiate

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:28.760
the left-hand side.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.674
And on the right-hand side I
take the derivative of x and I

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:32.173
get 1.

00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:32.673
OK, good.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.510
So now I've got
this equation and I

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.780
need to solve this
equation for w prime.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.780
Because if you look up
here, that's what I want.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.460
I want a particular
value of w prime.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.490
And as always happens in
implicit differentiation,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.890
from the point of
view of this w prime

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.200
it's only involved in the
equation in a very simple way.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.980
So there's it multiplied by
functions of x and w of x,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.430
but not-- you know, it's just
multiplied by something that

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.852
doesn't involve w prime at all.

00:06:04.852 --> 00:06:06.810
And then here it's
multiplied by something that

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.240
doesn't involve w prime at all.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.050
So you can just collect your
w prime's and divide through.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.690
You know, it's just like
solving a linear equation.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.190
So here, if we collect
our w prime's, this

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:31.560
is w prime of x times-- looks
like w of x plus 2 times e

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.950
to the w of x.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.220
Did I get that right?

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.772
Looks good.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:41.440
OK, so that's still equal to 1.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.750
So that means that w
prime of x is just-- well,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:56.260
just, you know-- it's equal
to 1 over w of x plus 2 times

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.250
e to the w of x.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.470
OK, so this is true for every x.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.630
But I don't need this
equation for every x.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.544
I just need the particular
value of w prime at 1.

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:10.710
So that's, so I'm going to
take this equation, then,

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.260
and I'm just going
to put in x equals 1.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.950
So I put in x equals 1--
well, let me do it over

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.290
here-- so I get w prime of 1.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.510
And I just, everywhere I
had an x, I put in a 1.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.645
So actually, in this equation
the only place x appears

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.130
is in the argument of w.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:33.410
So this is w of 1 plus
2 times e to the w of 1.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.010
OK.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.440
So in order to get w prime of 1,
I need to know what w of 1 is.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.280
But I had that.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.456
I had it, it was
right back here.

00:07:41.456 --> 00:07:43.122
There was the-- that
was my hint to you.

00:07:43.122 --> 00:07:45.730
Right, this is why
we're using this point

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.920
as a base point, which
is we know the value of w

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.510
for this value of x.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.750
So we take that value.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.480
So w of 1 is 0.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.620
So this is just 1 over--
well, 0 plus 2 is 2,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.350
and e to the 0 is 1.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.179
So it's just 1 over 2.

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:03.720
Sorry, that's written
a little oddly.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.730
We can make it 2 times 1.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.560
So 1 over 2.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:09.950
OK.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.990
So I take that back upstairs to
this equation that I had here.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.800
And I have that w of x is
approximately equal to w

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.590
prime of 1 times x minus 1.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:29.940
So w of x is approximately
equal to-- w prime of 1, we saw

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.245
is 1/2-- times x minus 1.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.910
And that approximation was
good near our base point.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.940
So that's good when x is near 1.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.210
All right.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.090
And then-- so this the
linear approximation.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.460
And I asked for the linear
approximation, its value

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.680
at the particular
point x equals 3/2.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:06.570
So w of 3/2 is approximately
1/2 times-- well, 3/2 minus 1

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.760
is also 1/2-- so
this is a quarter.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.640
OK, so this is our
estimate for w of 3/2.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.582
w of 3/2 is approximately 1/4.

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:19.040
If you wanted a
better estimate you

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.250
could try iterating
this process.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.480
Now you might have a, you
know-- or choosing some base

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.520
point even closer if you could
figure out the value of w

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.290
and x near that, near this point
that you're interested in, 3/2.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.270
So just to sum up what we did
was we had this implicitly

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.320
defined function w.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.660
We wanted to estimate
its value at a point

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.460
where we couldn't
compute it explicitly.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.940
So what we did was we did our
normal linear approximation

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.439
method.

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:48.825
Right?

00:09:48.825 --> 00:09:52.740
So we wrote down our normal
linear approximation formula.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.380
The only thing that
was slightly unusual

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.550
is that we had to use
implicit differentiation.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.210
In order to compute
the derivative that

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.827
appears in the
linear approximation,

00:10:00.827 --> 00:10:02.035
we implicitly differentiated.

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.150
OK?

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.090
So that happened just like
normal, and then at the end

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.130
we plugged in the values
that we were interested in,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.590
to actually compute
the particular value

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.190
of that approximation.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.783
So I'll end there.

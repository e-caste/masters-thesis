WEBVTT

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.190
PROFESSOR: All right, now for

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.600
something completely different.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.580
Before beginning though,
I would like to raise a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550
procedural question.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.580
It was my intent that quiz
number two, which is like a

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.790
little more than a week away,
was going to be part symmetry

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.410
and part tensors.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.870
I don't want to have your
fortunes based by weight of

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.700
2:1 on symmetry theory as
opposed to properties.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.010
What I would suggest, and you
can express your opinion

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.960
either way, is that we postpone
quiz number two by

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.640
maybe as much as 10 days, so
that it can be half symmetry

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.740
and half the introductory
discussion of tensors.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.300
And if that does not create a
conflict with some of your

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.320
other classes, I would propose
that as a suggestion.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.030
If not, we can just have on the
quiz what we're going to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.880
cover of tensors in the
next couple days and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.150
have the rest symmetry.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.180
So what I am suggesting is the
quiz was scheduled for a week

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.090
from November 8, which
is a Tuesday.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.920
What I would suggest is putting
that off to the 18th,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.950
and that will give us four
extra lectures--

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.720
six extra lectures-- on tensors
and we can make the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.330
quiz 50-50.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.925
AUDIENCE: What does that do
to quiz number three?

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:49.240
PROFESSOR: Quiz number three
is going to stay in place

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.750
because it's right at
the end of the term.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.970
AUDIENCE: What about the
subject in three?

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.620
PROFESSOR: It will
be all tensors.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.550
It will be all tensors
and properties.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.830
And the third quiz is set up
for longer than you think.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.470
It's December 8, so it'll
be about three weeks.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.275
AUDIENCE: So everything
from here on?

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:06.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.320
Does that make sense?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.770
Or is somebody going to have a
big, traumatic responsibility

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.020
at that point?

00:02:16.634 --> 00:02:19.793
AUDIENCE: I don't know, but I
think it would be probably be

00:02:19.793 --> 00:02:23.080
easiest for us not to
have it three days

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.980
before close of exams.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.800
PROFESSOR: OK, OK, that's
what I wanted to hear.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.630
How about if we went just a
little bit further then and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.025
did it not on the--

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.570
when was the suggestion?

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.650
The 18th.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.836
Let's say we did it on
Tuesday the 15th?

00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:48.260
Does that conflict
with anything?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.088
AUDIENCE: That's a little bit.

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:51.837
AUDIENCE: We were doing
it on the 18th.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:52.751
AUDIENCE: Is that Friday?

00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:54.122
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:55.736
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry, 18th.

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:57.742
I said it would be 17th.

00:02:57.742 --> 00:02:58.726
Excuse me.

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:00.202
AUDIENCE: That definitely would
be a little better.

00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:07.670
PROFESSOR: OK, let me allow you
to think about that, and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.600
that would be pushing it back
one week and maybe it'd be--

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.650
we'll see how much material
on tensors we cover.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.700
So let's table it for now but
let's say, tentatively, let's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.200
consider seriously moving
it to the 15th.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.450
OK?

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.140
But you guys have final
say if there's a

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.850
preference that you have.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.220
OK let's talk about properties
in first a general and rather

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.610
philosophic way.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.580
When we discuss properties we
very commonly lump together a

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.730
set of behaviors which have
some common phenomenology.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.810
So for example, we will talk
about mechanical properties.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.820
And that's a basket in which we
place many different sorts

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.920
of behavior.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.630
We place things like fracture
toughness, yield strength,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.829
elastic constants, a whole
variety of things involving

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.970
strength deformation
and so on.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.780
Or another thing we very often
lump together in a basket is

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.833
something called electrical
properties.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.640
And we talk about electrical
conductivity, ionic

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.500
conductivity, electronic
conductivity.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.120
We talk about dielectric
constants, we talk about

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.750
permittivity and permeability,
magnetic properties--

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.700
a whole bunch of other classes
of behavior, which have some

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.853
sort of root or description in
terms of electromagnetism.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.030
There are though a lot of
strange aspects to properties.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.030
There are some properties that
are determined for material

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.830
which no longer exists
when you're through

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.200
determining the property.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.780
You have a sample you want
to know what the

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.630
yield strength is.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.850
So you put the gradually
increasing load on it until

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.470
finally, POP, it breaks.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.600
And now you know what the
yield strength is for a

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.140
material that no
longer exists.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.980
Another example is an old one.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.070
Back before the days of X-ray
diffraction when people would

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.220
try to characterize material,
anything that is very

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.210
intensely colored usually looks
black, and that's not a

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.880
very definitive property.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.410
The color of something is a very
prominent characteristic.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.750
So for mineralogists, in
particular, anybody going out

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.460
into the hills and wanting to be
prepared to determine what

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.900
a particular rock that they
tripped over was had something

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.210
on a rope around their neck
called a streak plate.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.190
And what the streak plate
was was a little

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.270
rectangle of porcelain.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.630
And they would take this black
mineral and rub it on this

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.610
piece of porcelain and it
would leave a mark--

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.760
that was called the streak.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.540
And what this was was actually
little bunch of fragments that

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.150
rubbed off on to the porcelain
because the porcelain was

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.230
white and the fragments
were very small.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.680
A black piece of rock could
give you a streak that was

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.620
brown or green or deep orange.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.520
And so you really were
determining the color of the

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.450
material when it was in a form
finely divided enough that

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.350
light could pass through it.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.240
So the streak test was a very
important diagnostic for

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.490
determining minerals.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.410
There are some properties
that we refer to

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.770
as structure sensitive.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.800
In the sense that
their value--

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.390
conductivity is a
good example--

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.320
the value of ionic conductivity
depends on the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.280
impurities and point
defects that are

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.730
present in the material.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.550
So to say that the ionic
conductivity of a certain

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.160
material is such and such, you
have to specify the purity and

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.660
perfection of the material or
the property's meaningless.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:32.110
There are some properties that
are not even single-valued.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.400
And the best example there are
dielectric or magnetic

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.010
properties.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.210
If you plot the magnetization
of a material, the magnetic

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.380
moment per unit volume as a
function of the applied

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.760
magnetic field B, the material
is initially non-magnetized.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.930
When you apply B, you get a
magnetic moment per unit

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.850
volume that eventually
saturates.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.650
And then if you remove the
magnetic field, the material

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.290
keeps some of its
magnetization.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.390
It doesn't go to zero when you
reduce the field to zero.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.060
You have to reverse the field
to get the property to go to

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.340
zero and then magnetize it
in another direction.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.130
And if you continue to cycle the
magnetic field, you get a

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.050
behavior like this.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:28.000
This is hysteresis, and this
type of behavior is called

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.840
generally hysteretic.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.760
Same thing would be a relation
between the displacement

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.980
vector and an applied
electric field.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.580
But clearly you can have any
value of the magnetization in

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.780
this range.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.890
And if you relate the
magnetization as a function of

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.950
the applied field, you can
get any value of the

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.630
proportionality constant you
like between a negative

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.470
maximum and a positive maximum
including zero.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.370
So there's a property that's
not even single-valued.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.840
Depends on the past history
of the sample.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.190
And then there are even more
peculiar properties.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.180
There are properties
that are--

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:19.330
we call them composite
properties and very often

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.580
qualitative.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.880
What do they mean by a
composite property.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.930
Let me give you one example--

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.446
The property fuzzy.

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:36.680
If I say fuzzy, you know
exactly what I mean.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.880
It means something that has
a diffuse reflectivity,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.970
something that has a surface
texture that's yielding.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.710
It's not like rubbing
a wire brush.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.640
It's soft and giving, a whole
collection of different

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.200
properties.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.590
But yet when I say fuzzy, you
know exactly what I mean.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.280
Let me not be so facetious
as talking

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.530
about a fuzzy property.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.770
People such as ceramists or
powder metallurgists very

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.660
often will take a powder of a
material and consolidate it by

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:19.080
compacting it and heating it,
very often subject to a

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.840
compacting stress.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.990
And when you do that little
necks grow between the

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.870
particles and they
hold together and

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.120
the material is centric.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:37.090
So you refer to a property of
a powder as being centerable

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.090
or the centerability
of a powder.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.190
You know exactly what somebody
means by that.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.995
But what does it depend on?

00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:49.380
It depends on the surface
energy, it depends on vapor

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.620
pressure, depends on bulk
diffusion coefficients.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.850
It depends on surface diffusion
coefficients.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.230
And all of these things have to
be just right to make the

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.890
powder something that easily
densifies upon heating in the

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.170
application or not
of pressure.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.880
So you know exactly what I mean
by centerability, but it

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.810
is a very complex property.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:17.230
And was one that really was not
understood until probably

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.390
the late 1950s.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.835
Until then, it was an art that
was entirely empirical.

00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:27.790
And it was somebody here at
MIT, a fellow named Robert

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.080
Coble, who developed a theory
of centering that was the

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.480
first really workable theory
that described densification

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.040
by heating and compaction.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.060
OK, composite property that
depends on many different

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.535
individual properties
of the material.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:55.520
OK, what we are going to examine
here are equilibrium

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.350
properties that can be
rigorously defined and

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.630
measurable.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.480
So we're going to leave out of
the picture things like fuzzy

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.260
and centerability.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.520
And let me give a very nice,
obscure definition of what I

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.210
mean by a property.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.300
And what I mean by a property,
in terms of a formal

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.480
statement, is the response of
a material to a specific

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.390
change in a given set
of conditions.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.380
So the response of the material
to a specific change

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:33.380
in a set of conditions that
relates independent properties

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:39.390
and dependent properties for
a particular process.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.660
So I'll state that again
because I think

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.140
it's terribly elegant.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.830
So a property is the response of
the material to a specific

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.310
change in a given set of
conditions that relates

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.180
independent and dependent
quantities in

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.430
a particular process.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:02.260
Now there are a lot of
properties that have their

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.920
roots solidly embedded
in thermodynamics.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.980
So let me give you
a few of those.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:18.860
What we'll talk about when
we specify a property is

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.270
something that we will refer
to as a displacement.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:37.390
We'll talk about a generalized
displacement in response to a

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.915
generalized force.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.590
So some of the thermodynamic
quantities that are related in

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.645
this fashion--

00:13:58.645 --> 00:14:04.210
if we list some forces and some
displacements, the thing

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.880
that happens as a result of that
stimulus that's applied

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.130
to the material.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.030
Temperature can be regarded as
a force that results in all

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.340
sorts of processes
as a result--

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.360
thermal energy flow,
thermal expansion,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.300
all sorts of things.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.210
But one of the things that will
happen in response to a

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.530
temperature change

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.890
thermodynamically is an entropy.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:40.540
So you can view entropy as a
generalized displacement

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.390
resulting from the application
of temperature as a

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.640
generalized force.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:58.650
Another example is electric
field and the thing that

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.160
happens there, and
electromagnetism, is the

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.095
quantity, D, which
is displacement.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:18.230
Still another example, stress,
and the result of applying a

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.480
stress, among other things,
is a strain.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.100
What is special about these
forces in this displacement is

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:37.240
that their product is, in each
of these cases, energy, the

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.920
change in internal energy
of the particular body.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.540
And when that is the case,
these are said to be

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.790
conjugate--

00:15:50.136 --> 00:15:53.430
a conjugate force and
displacement.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.570
And there are other examples
that one can come up .with.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.685
Now to talk about a specific
set of properties.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.680
Very often, and this crept into
the earlier discussion,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.800
very often the thing that we
do to a material, as a

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.540
generalized force,
is a vector.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:32.290
So very often the thing that we
do to the material, apply

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.140
an electric field, apply a
magnetic field, apply a

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.900
temperature gradient, apply a
tensile stress, it has the

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.813
characteristics of a vector,
magnitude and direction.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.090
And in many cases, the thing
that happens as a generalized

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.710
displacement, we may call
this in general,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.200
q, is also a vector.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.710
An example is if we apply
an electric field as a

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.670
generalized force, one thing
that might happen is a current

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.170
flow, which is also a vector.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.910
And we are accustomed to
writing, q, the generalized

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.829
displacement, as a
proportionality constant,

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:24.180
sigma, which is in the case of
electric field and current

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.789
flow, the electrical
conductivity.

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:29.980
Let me call it, in general
terms, proportionality

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.330
constant, a, times the
applied vector, p.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.890
Is this something we would
like to stick with as a

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.780
general relation?

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.970
Well let me submit that writing
an expression of this

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.820
form makes an inherent
assumption.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:59.630
Namely that this will be true
for small, and we'll have to

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.690
define for each property
what we mean by a

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.000
small, applied vector.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.340
Let me give you an example.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.980
If p were--

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.500
the applied vector was electric
field, and the

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.110
resulting vector was current
flow, and the relation between

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.140
those is the conductivity--

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.650
a relation of this sort says
that if you double the field,

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.380
you double the conductivity.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.760
You triple the field, you
triple the conductivity.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.350
Obviously this can't go on
indefinitely because all a

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.110
sudden, POW, dielectric
breakdown.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.540
The sample evaporates
at the smoke.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.570
And again, you have the property
of a material which

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.680
no longer exists.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.310
So a lot of properties, we
inherently assume that the

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.940
applied vector is small in order
to write something in an

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.190
expression of this form.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.430
So for conductivity, dielectric
breakdown is going

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.470
to destroy the nice linear
relation between current flow

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.720
and electric field.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.630
That's not always the case.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.590
Let me give you an example
of another property.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:19.340
And this is a property, magnetic
susceptibility, which

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:28.940
relates the magnetization, which
is magnetic moment per

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:42.820
unit volume, and relates that to
an applied electric field--

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:51.530
an applied magnetic field, H.
And the proportionality

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.440
constant, represented by a Greek
chi, is the magnetic

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.690
susceptibility.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.790
So let me give you a
specific example.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:15.560
Suppose we have a chunk of glass
and the glass contains a

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.850
dilute concentration of iron.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.120
And iron carries a permanent
magnetic moment.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.460
And the reason I want to make
it a dilute concentration of

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.620
iron is I don't want these
magnetic moments close enough

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.760
that they can interact
with one another.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.090
I want this to, therefore,
be a dilute system.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.800
So we have different
iron atoms in this.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.500
Each iron atom has a
magnetic moment.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.350
And then we put this in a
magnetic field, H. And the

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.240
magnetic field acts on each of
these little magnetic moments

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.780
just as though it were
a compass needle.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.930
And so it will try to take each
of these moments and drag

00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.260
it into coincidence with
the magnetic field.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.180
But at a finite temperature,
temperatures making these

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.000
magnetic moments jiggle
around, so at a finite

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.190
temperature, the magnetic
moments will just not simply

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.400
zing into coincidence with
the magnetic field.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.240
You'll have to increase
the magnetic

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.860
field to make it larger.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.180
When that happens, more and more
of the magnetic moments

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.170
will come into alignment.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.850
And if you put on a really
strong magnetic field, then

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.600
every single magnetic moment
will be dragged into exact

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.470
alignment with the magnetic
field and

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.730
the system has saturated.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.340
There's no way you could squeeze
further magnetic

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.580
moment per unit volume
out of it.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.330
So again, you would expect, for
this particular property,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.640
magnetic susceptibility of a
material, if you plot it as a

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.740
function of the applied
magnetic field--

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.770
linear maybe be at low
applied fields--

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.480
but eventually if you make the
field strong enough, the

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.460
system is going to saturate.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.210
And then again, no longer will
the direction of the

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.180
magnetization, and that magnetic
moment, be parallel

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.900
to H. But the property becomes
nonlinear if the applied

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.950
vector is strong enough.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.020
This is an example of a property
where you would not

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:31.590
go wrong at all by stating
direct proportionality.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:37.670
For ordering to occur,
temperature and applied field

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.790
go hand in hand.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.610
Increased temperature tends
to create more disorder.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.350
Increased magnetic field tends
to align the moments.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.610
In the days when MIT had a
national magnet laboratory,

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.640
the magnet laboratory held the
record for the strongest

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.400
magnetic field ever produced
artificially by man.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.720
And if you took that magnetic
field and applied it to this

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:09.300
system of dilute iron in a
glass, you would have to lower

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.320
the temperature of the sample
to about 3 Kelvin before you

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.020
would begin to see saturation.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:23.120
So even the strongest field that
you could produce in a

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.380
laboratory environment would
not succeed in producing

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.460
non-linearity until you cooled
the sample down almost to

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.630
absolute zero.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.660
So here would be a case where
under any practical

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.570
consideration whatsoever,
assumption of strict

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.580
proportionality would be
right on the money.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.830
You'd be absolutely correct.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.530
But there's another assumption
built into this statement.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:57.050
P, the generalized force, is
a vector in the cases we're

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.990
discussing now, and q
is also a vector.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:07.290
So when we write an expression
of this form you're making

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.990
another assumption.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:14.630
And that is that the vector
displacement that results is

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.170
always exactly parallel to the
vector that you apply.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.230
Do I make a big deal
out of this?

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.740
Isn't that always going
to be the case?

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.050
I mean whoever heard of taking
a piece of metal and putting

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.680
an electric field on it in this
direction and having the

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.330
current run off in
this direction.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.580
It's absurd.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.970
Or maybe it isn't so absurd.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:44.360
So let's think of some of the
atomistics of this process.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.080
Now, since I know I'm among
friends, I will not hesitate

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.830
to display my ignorance, total

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.960
ignorance, of polymer chemistry.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.380
So suppose we had a
piece of polymer.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.410
That's what a polymer
molecule looks like.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:05.340
It's a more or less linear
molecule, and so these might,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.050
in a very highly ordered
polymer, be chains that lined

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.580
up like this.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.980
And suppose we now put an
electric field on this polymer

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.320
and asked how the current
will flow.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.190
Again, it would not be absurd
to say that an electron

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:27.040
sitting on this polymer chain
in response to this field

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.580
would be constrained only to
flow in the direction of the

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.180
chain and would find it rather
difficult to hop from one

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.260
chain to another.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.840
So maybe, just maybe, we could
apply an electric field to a

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.890
polymer and it would have a flow
in this direction, that

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.980
would be pointing in this
direction, and the current

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:52.100
flow, J, would be in
that direction.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:26:00.440
So should we maybe rethink this
idea of the direction of

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.740
the generalized displacement
being not parallel to the

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.520
direction of the generalized
force.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.740
OK, these are hypothetical
examples.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.950
Let me now give you an example
of a real property for a real

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:22.170
material, for which the thing
that happens, the vector that

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.340
happens, is decidedly not
parallel to the direction of

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.120
the applied vector.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.250
OK, thermal conductivity is
something that relates a heat

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:40.160
flux, usually represented by the
symbol K, and relates that

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.345
to a temperature gradient,
dt dx, which is a vector.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:58.450
The thing that gives rise to
thermal conductivity can be

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:03.300
either propagation of radiation
as in propagation of

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.460
light traveling through a
transparent material.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.525
But the other mechanism for
thermal conductivity is modes

00:27:12.525 --> 00:27:14.340
of lattice vibration.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.030
When a material is hot, the
atoms are jiggling around and

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.610
you can make the displacement
of an individual atom be

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.160
represented by a sum of waves
moving in all different

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.790
directions with a variety of
wavelengths in a variety of

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.670
amplitudes.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.750
Take all those waves, add them
together at a particular time,

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.460
and you get the displacement
of the atom.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:44.400
Propagation of heat by this
mechanism, by modes of thermal

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.460
vibration, can be very, very
anisotropic and probably the

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.450
best example of this is--

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.130
get a single crystal
of graphite.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.950
And have the layers, the
graphite sheets, which are

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:12.850
hexagonal rings in which each
carbon has three neighbors,

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:19.410
and have the sheets be parallel
to the surface of an

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.080
extended two-dimensional slab.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.140
Now we can't do that.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.120
Single crystals of graphite
don't occur

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.110
in sizes like that.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.660
But what you can do is make a
material called pyrolytic

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.530
graphite that you make by having
a reaction in the vapor

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.360
phase and having the soot that's
formed settle down onto

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.760
a substrate.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.610
And what happens is you nucleate
a graphite crystal in

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.160
one orientation, and that grows
preferentially with its

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.600
layers parallel to the surface
on which it's nucleated.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.940
And these nuclei occur
at random.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:57.200
So you get a bunch of single
crystals of graphite, which

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.990
all have their layers, their
three coordinated layers at

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.680
parallel, but they
are oriented at

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.150
random about their c-axis.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.950
And that's a material that's
very easy to prepare.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.290
And it's called pyrolytic
graphite, and it has

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.410
interesting applications
and properties.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.900
OK, now I'm going to suggest an
experiment to you and I'll

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.090
caution you, please do
not try this at home.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:28.290
Get yourself a piece of
pyrolytic graphite.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.374
Put a Bunsen burner
underneath it.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:38.280
Play the Bunsen burner on the
bottom of the sheet of

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.790
pyrolytic graphite.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.640
And to determine temperature,
we'll take a ball of cotton

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.410
and put it directly
above the flame.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.910
And then take another ball of
cotton and put it down at the

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.550
end of the sheet.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.210
If you do that and bring up the
Bunsen burner, this piece

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.140
of cotton will sit there
and sit there and sit

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.180
there and sit there.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.790
And this piece of cotton will
instantly burst into flame.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:07.140
So here's a case where dt dx,
the thermal gradient, points

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.580
in this direction.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.980
And the heat flow goes off in a
direction at right angles to

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.490
the temperature gradient,
almost

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.520
exactly at right angles.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.270
It turns out that the thermal
conductivity in this

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.600
direction, the value
of K in the--

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.810
I want to put crystallographic
directions on this.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:44.170
But K parallel to the layers
is equal to 10 to the third

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.970
times K, perpendicular
to the layers.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.710
So there's an anisotropy of the
property that amounts to a

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.890
factor of 1,000.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.650
Very dramatic.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:07.140
So what I'm leading up is that
in a general relation between

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:13.030
a generalized displacement, p,
and a generalized force--

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.920
I'm sorry, I'm using
q-- p and q--

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:22.520
we just can't simply put
some constant in front.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.710
Because that assumes inherently
that the direction

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.920
of what happens, the vector
that happens, is exactly

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:34.560
parallel to the direction of
the applied vector and that

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.860
generally is not true.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.990
The difference may be small but
it has to be taken into

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.240
consideration.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:49.680
All right, let me now suggest
a way of patching this up.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.600
What I'm going to
do is assume--

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.850
and it is an assumption--

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:10.110
we're going to assume that each
component of the vector

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:20.690
that happens is given by--

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.800
in fancy terms, the vector
that results as the

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:43.200
generalized displacement is
given by a linear combination

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:54.895
of every component of the
vector that's applied.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.485
And that's what we've defined
as the generalized force.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.120
So how would we express
this analytically?

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:29.240
I am going to use as my
coordinate system, not x, y,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.630
and z as we usually do,
I'm going to call

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:37.380
it x1, x2, and x3.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.560
The reason is we'll see some
unique properties of these

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.120
indices that are very useful
algebraically.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:58.490
So I'm going to now take my
applied vector, p, and I'm

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:07.840
going to assume that it has
three components, p1, p2, and

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:15.219
p3 along x1, x2, x3,
respectively.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:19.139
My coordinate system, although I
did not state it explicitly,

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.860
is going to be a Cartesian
coordinate system, not a

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.929
crystallographic coordinate
system.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:31.600
So what I'm proposing here is
that we take each component of

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.489
the resulting vector q--

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.860
let's say q1--

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.179
and we'll assume that that's
given by a linear combination

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:42.179
of all three components
of the vector p.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:47.250
So it'll be some number times
p1 plus some number times p2

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.580
plus some number times p3.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.969
And those numbers in general
will be different.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:00.920
So let's say I call the
coefficient a, and now I'm

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.280
going to define a convention
that will stay with us.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.250
I'm going to define each of
these coefficients, a, in

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:14.430
terms of the index of the
component of the generalized

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:21.240
displacement which is being
computed, and the coefficient

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:26.280
modifies the component of the
generalized force for that

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.790
particular term.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:32.900
So I'm going to call this a11,
where the 1 goes with this and

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.430
the 1 goes with this.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:39.310
I'm going to call this a12, so
that the 1 again says it's a

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.050
contribution to q1.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.450
The 2 says that this
term modifies p2. .

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.690
And this similarly
would be a13.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:57.690
For the term component of the
generalized displacement, q2,

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:06.890
I'll use the coefficients a21
times p1 plus a22 times p2,

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:11.540
plus 23 times p3.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:19.370
And q3 similarly will be a31
times p1, plus a32 times p2

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:24.200
plus a33 times p3.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.550
So I've got three simultaneous
equations then, one for each

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.370
component of the vector that
results, the generalized

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.620
displacement.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:39.410
So I can sum up this set of
three equations by saying that

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:45.280
the i-th component of q, where
this is some particular

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:54.410
component, q1, q2, or q3, is
given by the sum over j from 1

00:36:54.410 --> 00:37:05.960
to 3 of aij times p sub j.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:14.410
So I've got ai1 times p1, ai2
times p2 plus ai3 times p3.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:21.830
So this is in a nice, compact
little nugget the expression

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.910
that we are assuming will
apply for all sorts of

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.040
physical properties in which
this is a vector

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.380
and this is a vector--

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.420
electrical conductivity,
magnetic susceptibility,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.910
thermal conductivity,
and so on.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.000
OK, this is a bad point to
introduce something as hairy

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.940
as what comes next.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.140
But I've got one minute left,
and I think I can do it.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.410
I'm going to introduce something
called the Einstein

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:58.220
convention after old Albert
Einstein himself.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.170
I'm sorry, but nobody
said everything this

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.590
term had to be easy.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.410
So let me introduce, if you're
ready for it, the Einstein

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:06.660
convention.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:12.910
Old Albert, I think, was just
as lazy as anybody else.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:18.620
And he said it is going to be
a bloody pain in the butt--

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.305
I don't know if he put
it exactly this way.

00:38:20.305 --> 00:38:23.100
It's going to be a pain in the
butt to write this summation

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.840
every time we want to combine
three terms in a linear

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.500
combination.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:36.840
So the Einstein convention is
let us throw out the sigma and

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:44.070
write this expression just
as qi times aij p sub j.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:49.000
And whenever we see a subscript
repeated, summation

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.755
over repeated subscript
is implied.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.770
OK so that's the Einstein
convention.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.980
It will save us the trouble
of writing in a lot

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.680
of summation signs.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.710
But I would caution you that
this convention, compact and

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:28.200
convenient as it is, can define
some polynomials that

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.250
are nightmares.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.200
So let me give you one example
of this, and this is actually

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.450
a physical property.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:56.260
Let me say that Cijkl is given
by ai capital I aj capital J

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:10.450
ak capital K, al capital L times
let's say D, capital I,

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:16.270
capital J, capital K, capital
L. That actually, believe it

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.340
or not, means something
physically and we're going to

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.230
get to that in due course.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:24.040
But what this is, taking the
Einstein convention into

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.640
account, this is a quadruple
summation over capital I,

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.580
capital J, capital K, and
capital L. These are very

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:42.510
often referred to in this
business as dummy indices,

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.490
meaning that they don't really
mean anything physically.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.570
They're just indices
of summation.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.250
I would caution you that
this is a term

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.390
that does not permute.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.990
If I say those are dummy
indices, it means one thing.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.920
If I say those are indices,
dummy, it means something

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.510
completely different, and
you're apt to get

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.760
a poke in the nose.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:04.980
OK so these are dummy indices.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.600
Now, what does this represent?

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.090
I won't say what it represents
physically, but this consists

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:25.733
of terms in four variables
times a coefficient.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.090
So there are five quantities
in each term.

00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:49.730
If I sum over capital I, J, and
K from 1 to 3, there are

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:59.930
going to be 81 such terms,
each with five

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.250
elements in each term.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:06.850
So it's going to be on the order
of 405 terms in this

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.730
summation, and we've collapsed
the whole thing down, 405

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.260
terms in this nice summation.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.910
So it is a great facility for
writing down expressions

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:23.420
explicitly, but these terms can
hide a terribly, terribly

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.670
complex polynomial.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.290
All right, I think that's
a good place to quit.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.710
It continues to amaze me,
though, how some absolutely

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:43.150
trivial convention, when first
proposed by a great man, will

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:46.850
carry that man's name no matter
how stupid it is.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:51.530
So this is called the Einstein
convention by everybody who

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:52.820
works in this field.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.940
Another one, just briefly to
finish up, when you discuss

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:02.120
dislocations, you talk about a
circuit of steps around the

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:02.980
dislocation.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.905
That's called a Burgers
circuit.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.430
And if you do the same circuit
in a corresponding piece of

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:14.150
material that doesn't have a
dislocation, if this circuit

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:18.130
closes, this circuit fails to
close by something that's

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.420
called the Burgers vector.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:26.350
Every book on dislocation theory
says, Shockley called

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.820
this good material.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.550
I'm sorry, Shockley called
this good material, and

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.432
Shockley called this
bad material.

00:43:35.432 --> 00:43:37.120
Big deal--

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.320
good material, bad material
because it's got a

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:39.980
dislocation in it.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.580
But that is identified with
Shockley's name in every

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.830
discussion of dislocation.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.210
I'm just jealous because nobody
has ever said according

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:55.430
to me, such and such is--

00:43:55.430 --> 00:44:00.890
all right, see you
later in the week

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.140
for more great things.

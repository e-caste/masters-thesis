SCOTT HUGHES: All right,
welcome to Tuesday.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.840
So hopefully, you've all
saw the brief announcement

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.320
I send to the class.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.990
I have to introduce a colloquium
speaker over in Astrophysics,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.167
basically at the second
this class officially ends,

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:28.000
so I will be wrapping
things up a little bit

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.020
early so that I can take into
account the spatial separation

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000
and get back there in time to
actually do the introduction.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.850
I've already posted the
lecture notes of material

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.253
I'm going to be covering today,
and it'll probably spill--

00:00:43.253 --> 00:00:44.920
I hope to wrap it all
up today, but it's

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
possible it'll spill a
little bit into Thursday.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.582
So if you've already
looked at those notes,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.790
today will essentially just
be sort of my guided tour

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.570
through that material.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.445
So I want to pick it up with
where I left things last time.

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:57.820
So we covered a
bunch of material

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.400
that, again, I kind of emphasize
what we're doing right now

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.700
is just laying the mathematical
foundations in a very

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.180
thorough, almost excessively
thorough way in order

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
that we have a very strong
structure as we begin to move

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.362
into more physically
complicated situations

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:14.820
in the special relativity that
we're focusing on right now.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.260
So we talked about
this definition

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.440
of an inner product between
two four-vectors, two vectors

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.850
in space time.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.170
And it looks just like the inner
product between two vectors

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.660
that you are used to from
your Euclidean three space

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.290
intuition.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.720
It's just that we have
an extra bit there

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.220
that enters with a
minus sign having

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.040
to do with the time like
components of those two

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.020
four-vectors.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.170
And then, using the fact that
I can write my four vector

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.510
as components contracted onto
elements of a set of basis

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.198
vectors, I can use this
to define a tensor, which

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:52.240
I will get to the mathematical
definition of more

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.080
precisely in just a moment.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080
The dot product of
any two basis vectors,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.360
I will call that the tensor
component, eta alpha beta.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.240
OK, and so this is the metric
tensor of special relativity,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.820
at least in rectilinear
coordinates.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.970
Rectilinear basically just
means Cartesian but throwing

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.730
time in there as well.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.673
OK, when we start talking
about special relativity

00:02:14.673 --> 00:02:16.090
and curvilinear
coordinates, it'll

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.630
get a little bit more
complicated than that,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.580
and I not use a symbol
eta in that case.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.390
I am going to reserve eta
for this particular form

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.490
of the metric in this
coordinate system.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.640
And of course, when you actually
write out these components,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.235
a very compact way
of writing this is it

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:39.130
is just the matrix that has the
elements minus one, one, one,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.940
one down the diagonal and
zeros everywhere else.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.440
So this is a fairly common way
of writing a diagonal matrix.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.773
This just takes into account
the fact that there's zeros

00:02:46.773 --> 00:02:48.730
everywhere else.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.310
So I call this
the metric tensor,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.700
which kind of begs the
question, what's a tensor?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.750
So this is where we
concluded things last time.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.108
I'm going to generally
define a tensor of type 0n--

00:02:59.108 --> 00:03:01.150
we're going to change that
zero to something else

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.710
by the end of today's lecture.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.600
You'll be able to see where
I'm going probably from a mile

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.730
away, but let's just leave
it like this for now.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.820
So a tensor of type 0n is--

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.010
you can think of it as
a function or a mapping

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.730
of n vectors into Lorentz
invariant scalars, which

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.360
is linear in its n arguments.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.190
So the inner product clearly
falls into this category.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:35.050
If I think of a dot b, let's
say this inner product is

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.007
some number, lowercase a.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.527
A will be a Lorentz invariant.

00:03:42.527 --> 00:03:44.110
I forgot to state
this, but the reason

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.770
we define the inner
product in this way

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.780
is that we are motivated by
the invariant interval in space

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.950
and time between two events.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.340
We wanted to find an inner
product that duplicates

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.350
its mathematical structure.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:05.050
If I take one of these vectors,
multiply it by some scalar,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.730
linearity is going to hold.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.970
This will just be
eta alpha beta.

00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:13.660
This is terrible notation.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.868
I'm using the [INAUDIBLE]
symbol alpha for both a pre

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:18.310
factor and an index.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.430
Minus five points to me.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.320
Let's call this gamma.

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:31.190
You can quickly
convince yourself.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.648
That just comes out, and you
get a factor of gamma on this.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.260
You can do the same
thing on the second slot.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:44.705
If I take the dot product of a
with the sum of two vectors--

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.008
OK, et cetera.

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:05.800
You can keep going.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.717
All the rules for linearity
are going to hold.

00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:09.470
I'm not going to step
through them all.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.720
You can see where they all go.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.608
So whenever I'm going to
define a tensor, in my head,

00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:15.400
I'm imagining it's got
properties like this

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.480
that come along for the ride.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.180
Now, especially
when you see this

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.060
defined in certain
textbooks, MTW

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.880
is particularly
fond of doing this.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.672
So we come back to this
idea that it's sort

00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:27.130
of a function or a mapping.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.640
You can almost abstractly
define the tensor

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.960
as a mathematical machine
that's got two slots in it.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.270
So several of the
recommended textbooks

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.260
will write down equations.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.210
I'm going to put two
lines over the symbol

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.710
to sort of-- if you actually
read this, in for instance, MTW

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.085
or Caroll or
something like that,

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:06.060
this will be written
as a boldface symbol.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.477
It's hard to do
on the blackboard,

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:09.830
so I'm just going to
write double bars over it.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.340
So if I imagine this with
my slots filled with these,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.990
it's got two slots
associated with it.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.270
I fill it with
those two vectors.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.160
That is equivalent
to saying a dot b,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.357
which is equivalent to it
in this component notation,

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:30.190
something like this.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.910
So we have repeatedly
in the little bit

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.160
of time we've spent together--

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.535
I should say I have repeatedly,
in the little bit of time

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:47.120
we've spent together, emphasized
the distinction between frame

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.070
independent geometric
objects, things

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.200
that reside in the
manifold and have

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.130
kind of an integral, physical,
geometric sensibility

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.210
of their own and
their representations.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.460
I have emphasized
quite strongly that you

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.550
should think of
the vectors a and b

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.060
as being geometric objects.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.420
This is some thing that
is pointing in space time.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.160
We all agree that
this points, if that's

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.560
a displacement vector, it points
from event one to event two.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.130
OK, everyone agrees on that
geometric reality of this.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.900
Different observers
may represent

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.495
it using different components.

00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:23.870
That's just because
they're using

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.860
different coordinate systems.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.880
So when I write down
something like this--

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.590
so let's go back to
where I wrote before.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.690
This is going to turn into
some frame independent Lorentz

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.550
scalar a.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.730
So this is what I like to call
a frame independent object.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.980
Frame or Lorentz
independent geometric

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.585
object, as is this scalar.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.090
And so therefore, the
tensor must be a frame

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.070
independent geometric
object as well.

00:08:54.087 --> 00:08:55.920
That's a lot of words
around the blackboard,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.780
but I really want to
nail that point home.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.840
So tensors just like vectors.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.240
Think of them as
geometric objects

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.990
that have an intrinsic geometric
meaning associated with them

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.850
that lives in spacetime.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.100
We will talk about
certain examples of them.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.230
OK, you guys all have some
intuition about vectors,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.640
because you've
been doing vectors

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.980
ever since you took your first
kindergarten physics course,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.570
and so you know that there's
some kind of an object that

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.230
points in a certain direction.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.200
Tensors are a little bit more
challenging in many cases

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.960
to develop an intuition for.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.970
Some of them really do
have a fairly simple

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.050
geometric interpretation.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.600
You can kind of
think of them as--

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.933
for instance, we're going to
introduce one a little bit,

00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:34.140
which describes the flow
of energy and momentum

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.340
in space time.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.890
And so it'll have two
indices associated with it,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.110
and those indices
tell me about what

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.360
component of energy
or momentum is flowing

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.500
in a particular direction.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.090
Really easy to interpret that.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.520
Some of the others, not so much.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.460
Nonetheless, they do have
this geometric meaning

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.780
underneath the hood.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.160
And that's bound up
in the fact that if I

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.910
put frame independent geometric
objects into all the slots,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.705
I get a Lorentz invariant
number out of it.

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:05.910
It's the only way that
that can sort of work.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.620
But one reason why
I'm going through this

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.100
is that just like with
vectors, different observers,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.950
different frames will
get different components

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.790
in general.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.980
So there will be different
representations according

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.455
to different observers.

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:23.080
I'm going to write
down the same thing.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.490
Representations.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.700
So if you want to get
a particular observer's

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.890
components out of
the tensor, there's

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.720
actually a very simple
recipe for this.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:29.250
All you do is, you take your
tensor, and into its slots,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.910
you plug in the basis vectors
that that observer uses.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.300
So if I want to get
the components--

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.570
and this, unfortunately,
is a fairly stupid example,

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.862
but it's the only one we've
got at the moment, so let's

00:11:57.862 --> 00:12:00.060
just work with it.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:07.770
If I take the tensor eta, the
special relativity metric,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.560
I plug in some
observer's basis factors

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.590
into this thing, this by
definition is eta alpha beta.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.515
Suppose I have a different
observer who comes along,

00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:21.390
someone who-- we're
doing special relativity,

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.950
so someone who's dashing
through the room at three

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.690
quarters of the speed of light.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.490
I want to know what their
components would be.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.600
Well, what I do is, I
just plug into the slots--

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.020
let's put bars on
the complements

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.430
to denote this other observer.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.850
Do this operation for this other
observers set of basis vectors,

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.520
and you will get the components
that they will measure.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.640
Now, one of the reasons
why I'm going through this

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.440
is that last time,
we talked about how

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.590
to transform basis vectors
between different reference

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.460
frames.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.850
We know that these guys are
just related to one another

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.045
by a Lorentz
transformation matrix.

00:13:10.045 --> 00:13:11.670
So let's just take
this a step further.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.530
So this is telling me
that the components

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:28.100
of the metric in
this barred frame,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.600
they're going to be what I get
when I put it into the slots.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.060
Those are the basis vectors
in the barred frame using

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.560
the Lorentz
transformation matrix

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.930
to go from the unbarred
frame to the barred frame.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.590
Now, remember again-- this
is one of those places where

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.100
if you're sort of just becoming
comfortable with the index

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.740
notation, you're temptation
at this stage is always to go,

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.090
these are matrices.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.030
I should start doing
matrix multiplication.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:14.280
If you set that urge within you
aside, you go, no, no, no, no.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.740
Those are just a
set of 16 numbers.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.990
For any particular
set of complements,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.910
I can just pull them out.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.390
So because of the linearity
of all these slots

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:40.380
with this thing, this just
becomes those two Lorentz

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.390
transformation matrices acting
on the abstract metric tensor

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:50.070
with the unbarred basis
vectors in the slots.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.562
And this we already know.

00:14:51.562 --> 00:14:53.520
This is, by definition,
this is just eta mu nu.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.490
Repeat this exercise
for any tensor

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.120
you care to write down, any 0n
tensor you care to write down.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.760
Go through all
this manipulation,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.430
and you will always find that
there's a very simple algorithm

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.840
forgetting the
components in, let's

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.470
call it the barred
observers frame,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.773
as converted from the
unbarred observers frame.

00:15:31.773 --> 00:15:33.940
Essentially, you just hit
it with a bunch of Lorentz

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.420
transform matrices, and as
an old professor of mine

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.640
liked to say at this
point, line up the indices.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.660
That's really all
we're doing, is

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.118
we're just going
to line up the mus

00:15:42.118 --> 00:15:43.480
to convert them to alpha bars.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.150
Alpha bar here, mu
there, put this guy here.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.540
I want to convert my
new into a beta bar.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.670
I put my matrix there.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.170
Boom.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.820
Just line up the
indices, and we're done.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.420
Now, this is, as I
kind of emphasized,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:06.940
a fairly stupid
example, because if you

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.110
take the diagonal of
minus one, one, one, one

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.417
and you apply the most
God awful immense Lorentz

00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:15.250
transformation you care
to write down to it,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.410
you do all the
matrix manipulation

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.090
and you line it all up,
what you'll end up finding

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:28.510
is that this is the diagonal
of minus one, one, one, one

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.500
in all frames.

00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:35.170
That's actually one of the
defining characteristics

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.920
of the metric of
special relativity.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.680
If you're working
curvilinear coordinates,

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.110
the metric is always minus one,
one, one, one to all observers.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.220
So the recipe holds in general.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.530
This will hold whenever
we are studying tensors

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.922
from now and from henceforth.

00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:54.130
Just so happens that this
first example we were given

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.047
is kind of a dumb one.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:05.220
Nonetheless, learn the lesson
and overlook the example,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.109
and wisdom shall be yours.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.050
I want to spend a
few moments talking

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:19.650
about a particular subset of
tensors, of the 0n tensors,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.260
where n equals one.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.660
This is a subset of
tensions in general

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.780
that is known in many
textbooks as one forms.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.990
For reasons that I will
elaborate on in probably

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.295
10 or so minutes, these are also
sometimes called dual vectors.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.200
And just if that's sort of
making some neurons light up

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.080
in your head, set that
aside for a moment.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.510
I want to carefully
go through them

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.660
before I indicate the manner in
which there is a duality that

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.890
is being applied here.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.810
So if we go back to the
definition of a tensor,

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:22.180
this tells us that a
one form is a mapping

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:31.760
from a single vector to the
Lorentz invariant scalar.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.693
So using some notation
that I will probably only

00:18:37.693 --> 00:18:39.110
use in this lecture,
because we're

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.810
going to move past this
notation pretty soon,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.350
let's say a one form--

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.440
I'm going to denote this
with an over tilde on it.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.140
So let's say p is a one form.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.260
It will have in this
sort of abstract notation

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.840
a single slot, so I put
the vector a into it.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.280
And this then gives
me some scalar out.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.130
So in my notes, I go through
some stuff indicating

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.090
that this guy is-- it's
a linear operation,

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.090
but that's obvious, because
it just inherits all

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.560
the properties from
tensors, so I'm not

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.280
going to go through that.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.305
If you want to double
check some of the details,

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:44.140
they're in the notes
that have been posted.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.570
Just like with the
tensors, I extract

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:58.500
components from this thing
by putting my basis vectors

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.000
inside.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:12.720
So if I take my one form p
and I put it in my alpha basis

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.150
vector, this gives me the alpha
component of the one form.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.980
Notice, it's in the
downstairs position.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:28.610
So one of the reasons why I
want to go through this step

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.370
is it gives me a way
to think about what's

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.870
going on at this scalar that
I wrote down on the top board

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.370
here.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.203
So what is this scalar
that I get by putting

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:38.370
a vector into my one form?

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.160
So I take this, put
my vector in here.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.440
I use the fact that
I can write my vector

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.910
using its components
and the basis vector.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.860
I use linearity to
pull this guy out.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.240
So the scalar that
I get by doing this

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.480
is just the scalar that one
gets by contracting the upstairs

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.850
components that I use
to set up my vector

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.760
with the downstairs components
I use to set up my one form.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.190
This is an operation that is
called contraction, for reasons

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.320
that I hope are fairly obvious.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.250
So let me define a few other
characteristics of this thing,

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.730
and in just a few moments,
we'll see what this is good for.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.800
OK, so one of things
I'm going to want to do

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.722
is change the representation
of those things.

00:22:05.722 --> 00:22:08.180
So I'm going to want to know
how these components transform

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.283
between different
frames of reference.

00:22:10.283 --> 00:22:11.450
But we've already done that.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.390
We did this using tensors,
and this is just a tensor.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.700
So if I change
reference frames, if I

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.320
want to know what the
components are according

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.100
to some barred
observer, I will step

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.010
through the algebra
in my notes, but I

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.670
think you know where I'm
going to go with this.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.000
You just take the components
in the unbarred frame,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.390
line it up, contract it with
the correct setup of my Lorentz

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.650
transformation matrix, boom.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.290
Line at the indices,
and we've got it there.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.180
So the last thing which I want
to do with this before I talk

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.260
a little bit about what this
is really good for is say,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.460
you know, I've got
these basis vectors that

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.323
allow me to relate the
components of my vectors

00:22:57.323 --> 00:22:59.240
to the geometric object
in a way where I don't

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.407
use a represented bi-symbol.

00:23:00.407 --> 00:23:03.320
I actually have an
honest to God equal sign.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.635
Can I define a similar
set of basis one forms?

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:28.530
What I want to do is define a
family of geometric objects,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:42.070
and I will denote them with
an omega and a tilde such

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:49.390
that any one form can be written
as its components attached

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.970
to these little basis vectors.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.920
Well, the way I'm
going to do this

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.310
is, I'm going to exploit
the fact that I already

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.250
know what basis vectors are.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.800
So I know, for instance,
that if I take my one form

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.885
and I plug in a basis
factor, I get this.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.820
And so what I want to
do is combine this thing

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:33.020
which I would like to
do with the defining

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.870
operation of contractions.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.610
So I know p alpha
a alpha is what

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.900
I get when I've got my one
form and I plug into its slot

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.811
the vector a.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:26.580
OK, so let's insist
that when I do this,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:34.125
I can write this as
p beta omega beta.

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:35.750
Now remember, these
are the components.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.550
This is the actual
basis one form.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:42.450
So I'm going to stick
into my basis one form

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.650
this form of the vector.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:07.000
I can then use the linearity
of the tensor nature

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.040
to pull out that component of a.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.920
So what this tells me is
this is exactly what I want,

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.460
provided whatever this
geometric object is,

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:33.420
it obeys the rule that when
I plug basis vectors into it,

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.890
I get the Kronecker delta back.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.930
Now, this may all seem really,
really trivial right now.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.310
And indeed, if you
think about this,

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.435
in terms of just running
down mathematical symbols,

00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.042
this is fairly trivial.

00:26:45.042 --> 00:26:46.500
One thing which I
want to emphasize

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.480
is that if you go
through and say, well,

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.550
if I'm working in
a basis where this

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.160
has a time-like component
that I'll say is one,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.550
the time-like direction
is zero everywhere else.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.480
Remember to set the
points in the x direction,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.250
so it's zero, one along
x, zero everywhere else.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.720
This then leads to--

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:13.880
so as an example, a
set of basis objects

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:26.590
that a particular observer
would write just like so.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.710
I won't write out the
two and three components.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.550
And again, you look at this and
you think to yourself, dude,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.310
you're just repeating
basis vectors.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.332
What's the big deal here?

00:27:37.332 --> 00:27:39.790
Now, I'm going to explain the
fact that these are sometimes

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.373
called dual vectors.

00:27:41.373 --> 00:27:43.540
So if we want to think about
this in a language that

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.390
is reminiscent of
linear algebra,

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:51.160
if you think of the basis
vectors as column vectors,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.940
then my basis one forms are
essentially row vectors.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.520
So these look a lot
like my basis vectors.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.800
They enter in a dual way.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.960
And so they're going to
play an important role

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.460
in helping us to--

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.440
whenever I contract
two objects together

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.530
to make some kind of a
Lorentz invariant scalar,

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.382
I'm going to want to
only combine objects

00:28:48.382 --> 00:28:49.590
that have a dual nature like.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.048
That's the only way I can get
something sensible out of it.

00:28:52.048 --> 00:28:53.340
So let me give you an example.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:09.960
Mathematically, this is an
equation that I can write down.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.500
No question.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.640
If I'm in a
particular frame, I've

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.170
got the components
of vector a, I've

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.000
got the complements
of vector b, I

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.400
can multiply their complements
together, sum them,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.650
and square them.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.970
So this is mathematically
well-defined but plays no role

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:33.340
in the physics we are going
to talk about this term,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.490
because this is not related
to the underlying invariant

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.910
structure of the manifold
that we are working with.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.970
So remember I talked about
how a manifold is essentially

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.360
a sufficiently smooth set of
points endowed with a metric?

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.160
Well, the metric is what tells
us that this is mathematically

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.660
short.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.850
Write it down, but
it means nothing.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:30:08.070
By contrast, of course this
has frame independent meaning.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.539
This is important.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:21.130
So that's the sense in which
these one forms are often

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.170
called duels actors.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.197
It is when they are
combined with vectors,

00:30:25.197 --> 00:30:27.280
they are duel to it in the
sense that when they're

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.070
combined in this
appropriate way,

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.290
we find that they
describe the physics,

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.040
they capture the
invariant characteristics

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.050
of the physics that are
important in the theory

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.250
that we are describing.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:43.780
If I may give one
more example that

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.590
is from a completely
different field

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.590
but I think helps to sort of
illustrate a useful analogy

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.500
to think about these
things, suppose

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.260
you are doing quantum
mechanics and I give you

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.760
two wave functions.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:04.520
So suppose you have
a wave function

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:10.020
psi of x and another
wave function phi of x.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:17.080
If you wanted to, you could
multiply them together

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.077
and integrate overall space.

00:31:20.077 --> 00:31:22.410
I don't know what you would
do with that, but you could.

00:31:24.528 --> 00:31:26.820
On the other hand, you could
take the complex conjugate

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:31.040
of one of them, multiply
it by the other one,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.952
multiply it overall
space, and in the notation

00:31:34.952 --> 00:31:36.660
that you learn about,
this is, of course,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.780
just the inner product of wave
function psi with wave function

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.250
phi.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.290
Forming the one
form, using a one

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:47.720
form is akin to selecting
an object that has--

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.550
it allows us to make a
mathematical construction

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.710
similar to the quantum
mechanical enterprise

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.270
that we use here.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.170
And as we'll see in just
a couple of minutes,

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.440
it's actually really easy
to flip back and forth

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.760
between one forms and vectors.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.892
OK, so a better
way to move forward

00:32:05.892 --> 00:32:07.600
with this is rather
than talking in terms

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.700
of these more abstract things,
let me you a good example.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:19.407
So imagine I have some
trajectory through spacetime.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.370
So let's let the t axis go up.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.740
There's my x and y-axes.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.880
You all can imagine the z-axis.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.790
And some observer moves
through spacetime like so.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.660
Last lecture, we
talked about a couple

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.090
of important examples
of four-vectors.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.730
And so one which is
germane to the situation

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.730
is the four velocity
of this observer.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.610
That just expresses
the rate of change

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:17.390
of its position in spacetime
per unit proper time.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:23.870
And I'll remind
you, tau is time as

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.270
measured along this
observer's trajectory.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.490
So roughly speaking, not
even roughly speaking,

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.730
exactly speaking,
tau is the time

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.670
that is measured by the by
the watch of the person moving

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.352
along there.

00:33:36.352 --> 00:33:40.040
So suppose in addition to this
person sort of trundling along

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:48.120
through spacetime
here, suppose spacetime

00:33:48.120 --> 00:34:00.390
is filled with some field,
phi, which depends on all

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.870
of my spacetime coordinates.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.340
Question I want
to ask is, what is

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.704
the rate of change of phi along
this observer's trajectory?

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:42.630
So if you are working in
ordinary Euclidean space,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.380
you would basically
say, ah, this is easy.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.139
So you're three space intuition.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.120
You don't have this proper
time to worry about.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:06.000
So you would just say that d
phi dt along this trajectory

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.800
is just what I get
when I calculate dx dt.

00:35:11.305 --> 00:35:12.680
And then look at
the x derivative

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.160
of my field phi plus dy dt.

00:35:34.615 --> 00:35:35.990
This is one of
those places where

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.657
getting the difference
between a partial

00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:39.810
and a total derivative
right is important.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.040
So if you see me do that
again, if I don't correct it,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.850
yell at me.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.850
OK, so you get this.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.770
And then you say, ah,
this is nothing more

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.470
than that particle's
velocity dotted

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.430
into the gradient
of the field phi.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.250
It's a directional
derivative along the velocity

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.110
of this trajectory.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.078
So generalizing
this to spacetime,

00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:04.870
you basically have the
same thing going on.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.160
Only now, time is a coordinate.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.762
So we don't treat time as
the independent parameter

00:36:32.762 --> 00:36:35.095
that describes the ticking
of clocks as I move along it.

00:36:35.095 --> 00:36:37.480
I use the proper
time of the observer

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.022
as my independent parameter.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:47.880
So what I will say
is, the rate at which

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.070
the field changes per
unit of this guy's

00:36:50.070 --> 00:37:12.620
proper time, every one of these
is a component of the four

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.650
velocity.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.750
So now, we introduce a
little bit of notation.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:47.750
So this derivative is what I
get when I contract the four

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.720
velocity against a quantity
that's defined by taking

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.325
the derivative of this field.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.070
We're going to be taking
derivatives like this a lot,

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.470
so a little bit of
notation being introduced

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.030
to save us some writing.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.300
This is the directional
derivative along the trajectory

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:10.990
of this body.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.270
Now, this is a frame
independent scalar.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:22.240
This is a quality that all
observers will agree on.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.347
This is a four velocity.

00:38:24.347 --> 00:38:25.680
We know this is a four velocity.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.300
These are the components
of a four-vector,

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.780
so these are the
components of a one form.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.800
So the generalization
of a gradient

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.420
is an example of a one form.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:22.590
So re-using that abstract
notation that I gave earlier,

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:25.920
I can write-- so the way
you will sometimes see this

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:33.090
is, the abstract gradient
one form of the field phi

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:41.080
is represented by the
components, the alpha phi.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.570
You will also in some cases--

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.800
and I actually have a few
lines about this in my notes--

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.120
sometimes, people will recycle
the notation of a gradient

00:39:52.120 --> 00:40:04.130
that you guys learn about
in undergraduate E&M.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.820
I urge a little bit of
caution with this notation,

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.930
because we are going to use
this symbol for a derivative

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.010
to mean something a
little bit different

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.510
in just a couple of lectures.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.703
It turns out that the
something different reduces

00:40:17.703 --> 00:40:19.370
to this in the special
relativity limit,

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.440
so there's no harm being done.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.630
But just bear in mind
this particular notion

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.300
of a derivative here is
going to change its meaning

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.400
in a little bit.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.060
Another little bit of notation
that is sometimes used here,

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.710
and this is one
more unfortunately,

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:40.950
I think I'm stuck with this
notation, one often says--

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.710
so this idea of
taking a derivative

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:50.680
along a particular four
velocity, it comes up a lot.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:56.150
So sometimes, what
people then do

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.810
is, they define it as
the directional gradient

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.490
along u of the field phi.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.430
So don't worry
about this too much.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.050
We'll come back to us a
little bit more appropriate.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.040
I just want you to
be aware, especially

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.873
for those of you who
might be reading ahead,

00:41:08.873 --> 00:41:09.920
when you see this.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.320
So just think of this as
what you get when I am taking

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.900
a gradient along a velocity u.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.690
It basically refers to the
gradient one form contracted

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.620
with the four-vector u.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:32.860
So the last thing I want
to do as I talk about this

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.740
is revisit this
notion of one forms

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.870
as being dual to vectors
for just a moment.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.590
So we've just
introduced the gradient

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.750
as our first example
of a one form.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.740
So the notion of the
gradient as a one form, this

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:17.660
gives us a nice way to think
about what the basis one

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.180
forms mean.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.580
So when I introduced basis
one forms a few moments ago,

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.290
it was a purely
mathematical definition.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.330
I just wanted to
have objects such

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.550
that when I popped
in the basis vectors,

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.740
I got the Kronecker delta back.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.622
And after belaboring
the obvious, perhaps

00:42:37.622 --> 00:42:39.330
for a little bit too
long, we essentially

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.920
got a bunch of ones
and zeros out of it.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:55.530
Now, putting in math
all of those words,

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.730
I did a lot of junk to get that.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:08.750
But we also know
that if I just take

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.580
the derivative of my
coordinate with my coordinate,

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:18.470
I'm going to get the
Kronecker deltas.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.960
This and this, these
are the same thing.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.720
So I can think of this
operation here as telling me

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:41.240
if I regard this as this kind
of abstract form of the gradient

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:47.250
applied to the
coordinate itself,

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.360
this is nothing more
than my basis one form.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.690
So my basis one forms are
kind of like gradients

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.248
of my coordinates.

00:43:56.248 --> 00:43:57.790
OK, you're sitting
here thinking, OK,

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.832
what the hell does this
have to do with anything?

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.490
So when we combine--

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.550
set that aside for
just a second--

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.225
and remind you of some
pretty important intuition

00:44:20.225 --> 00:44:22.100
that you probably learned
the very first time

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.392
you learned about the gradient.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:41.540
So imagine I just draw level
surfaces of some function in--

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.060
I'll just do two
dimensional space.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:55.300
OK, so I have some
function h of x and y.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.920
This represents, like for
instance, a height field.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.420
If I'm looking at
a topographic map,

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.910
this might tell me about
where things are high

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.250
and where things are low.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:08.530
So h of xy, there might be
level surfaces on my map.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.240
It'd kind of look like this.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.455
And there'd be another one
that kind of looks like this.

00:45:14.455 --> 00:45:16.525
And maybe it'd have
something like this,

00:45:16.525 --> 00:45:21.170
and then something
kind of right here.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.940
So we know looking at this
thing that the gradient is very

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.760
low here and very high here.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.020
Let's put this into
the language of what

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.170
we are looking at right now.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:39.700
OK, let's let delta x be a
displacement vector in the xy

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:55.474
plane, and dh is going to be
my one form of my [] function.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:06.850
How do I get the
change in height

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.060
as I move along my
displacement vector?

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:30.140
Well, take my one form,
plop into its slot delta x,

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.450
I get something like this.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.360
The thing which I kind
of want to emphasize here

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.700
is, we have a lot of geometric
intuition about vectors.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.500
So if I have a delta x--

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.940
let' say this is my delta x.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:51.880
It lasts for about
this long over here.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:56.090
I take the exact same delta
x, and I apply it over here.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.460
I get a very different
result, because that

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.450
goes through many more
contours on the left side

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.120
than it does on the right side.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.158
And the thing-- this is where
this duality kind of comes

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:10.700
in, and I'm going to put up a
couple of graphics illustrating

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.930
this here--

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:18.670
is that you should
think of the one form

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.480
as essentially that
set of level surfaces.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.480
It's a little confusing.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.230
I'm not going to--

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.750
I mean, I can see a
couple blank looks.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.250
Maybe even the
majority of you have

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.290
kind of blank looks
on your faces here.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.810
And that's fine.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.850
So what I want you to
regard is that when

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.410
I'm talking about
basis one forms

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:38.660
and one forms of functions,
they have a very different

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.790
geometric interpretation, even
though you're kind of used

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:42.290
to gradient as
telling you something

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.670
about the direction along
which something is changing.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.180
Actually, you define
that direction.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.200
The thing that
you're worried about

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.867
is sort of how close
the different level

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.840
surfaces are of things.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:57.380
OK, so coming back to this
idea that my basis one form

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.600
that I use are essentially
just the gradients

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.800
of the coordinates.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.300
So I'm going to put
some graphics up

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.790
on the website,
which I have actually

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:09.840
scanned out of the textbook by
Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.460
And what they basically
show is, let's

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.180
say this is the time direction.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.030
Let's say this is my x-axis.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.350
And this is my y-axis.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.080
Your intuition is
that the x basis

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.450
vector will be a little
arrow pointing along x.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.480
Well, what your intuition
should be like for the x basis

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:41.990
one form is a series of sheets
normal to the x-axis that

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.750
fill all of space.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:47.910
OK, spaced one
unit apart, filling

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:51.120
all of space kind of like that.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:59.100
So here's one example
of one of those sheets.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.195
And notice, the x-axis pierces
every one of those things.

00:49:21.195 --> 00:49:22.570
That's another
way in which these

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.490
are sort of a set
of dual functions

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.810
to the vectors themselves.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.540
This notion-- so
I'm going to turn

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.970
to something which is
perhaps a little less

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.405
weird in about 30 seconds.

00:49:36.405 --> 00:49:37.780
But the one thing
which I kind of

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.430
want to emphasize with
this-- and again, I'm

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.750
going to put a couple
graphics up that

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:41.560
help to illustrate this.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.602
And there's some really
nice discussions of this.

00:49:43.602 --> 00:49:46.780
MTW is particularly good
for this discussion.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.910
This ends up being a
really useful notion

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.850
for capturing how we are
going to compute fluxes

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:53.882
through particular directions.

00:49:53.882 --> 00:49:55.840
Because if I want to know
the flux of something

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.110
in the x direction,
well, my x basis one form

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.270
is actually like a sheet
that captures everything

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.767
that flows in the x direction.

00:50:02.767 --> 00:50:04.600
So it's sort of a
mathematical object that's

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.085
designed for catching fluxes.

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:15.128
If isn't quite gelling
with you, that's fine.

00:50:15.128 --> 00:50:17.170
This is without a doubt
one of the goofier things

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.720
we're going to talk about in
this first introductory period

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.990
of stuff.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.480
This is one of
those places where

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.370
I think it's sort of
fair to say, if you're

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.320
not quite getting
what's going on,

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.703
shut up and calculate
works well enough.

00:50:28.703 --> 00:50:31.120
It's kind of like you know the
Feynman's mantra on quantum

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.620
mechanics.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.410
Sometimes, you've just
got to say, OK, whatever.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.208
Learn the way it
goes, and it's kind

00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:37.750
of like playing a
musical instrument.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.280
You sort of strum it and
practice it for a while,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.072
and it becomes second
nature after a while.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:54.130
All right, so to
wrap this up, what

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.460
I want to do for the last
major thing today is,

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:02.960
I hope I can kind of put a bow
on our discussion of tensors.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.720
Let's come back to the metric
as our original example

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.110
of a tensor here.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:14.790
So when I give you the
metric as an abstract tensor,

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:26.710
and I imagine I have
filled both slots,

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.870
I get a Lorentz
invariant number.

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:38.220
A dot b is what I get
when I take this tensor

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:42.400
and I put a and b into it slots.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.680
Suppose I only fill
one of its slots.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:56.080
Well, if I take this,
I plug in the vector

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.770
a but I leave the other slot
blank, well, what I've got

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:07.790
is a mathematical object
that will take a vector

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.690
and produce a Lorentz
invariance number.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:28.520
That's a one form.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.240
So let's do this very carefully
and abstractly for a moment.

00:52:50.065 --> 00:52:53.630
But at this point, we basically
have almost all the pieces

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:54.750
in place.

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:57.620
And so I'm going to kind of
tone down some of the formality

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.680
fairly soon.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:05.430
So let's define a one
form, an object that

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:09.030
takes a single
vector inside of it

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:14.960
as what I get when
I take the metric

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.620
and put that vector in there.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:19.520
If I want to get
its components out,

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.190
well, I know the way I do
that is I put the basis

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.880
vector in there.

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:43.520
This guy is symmetric, so I can
flip the order of the metric.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.520
It's symmetric, so I can
flip the order of these guys.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:55.380
And what this tells me is that
my one form component of a

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.260
is just the vector
component of a hit

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.290
by the components of the metric.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:14.490
In other words, the metric
converts vectors into one forms

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:19.220
by lowering the indices.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.580
This is an invertebrate
procedure as well.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:34.960
So this metric, I can define
eta with indices in the upstairs

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:46.390
position by requiring that
eta alpha beta contracted

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.530
with it in the
downstairs position

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:53.360
gives me the identity back.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.700
Incidentally, when
you do this, you again

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.370
find it's got exactly the
same matrix representation.

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.300
So this thing with its indices
in the upstairs position

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.360
is just minus one,
one, one, one.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.580
It will not always
be that way, though.

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:10.910
Again, this is just
because special relativity

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.030
in rectilinear
coordinates is simple.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:23.445
So I will often call
that the inverse metric.

00:55:26.953 --> 00:55:28.370
And then, you
shouldn't have a lot

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:33.380
of trouble convincing yourself
that if I've got a one form,

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:47.926
I can make a vector out of it
by a contraction operation.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.797
That now tells me that I have
about 16 gagillian-- well,

00:55:58.797 --> 00:56:00.630
actually, it's a countable
and finite thing.

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:07.130
But I have many ways that I can
write down the inner product

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:13.620
between two vectors.

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:25.530
This guy is-- if you
like, you can now

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:28.890
regard a vector as being
a sort of a function

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:30.560
that you put one forms into.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.920
These are all the same.

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.520
These are all equivalents
to one another.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.800
And actually making
a distinction

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.690
between vector in one
form and all that,

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:02.980
it's just kind of gotten
stupid at this point.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.300
So the distinction among
these different objects,

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.950
the different names,
kind of doesn't matter.

00:57:29.498 --> 00:57:31.040
And indeed, you sort
of look at this.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.880
Up until now, we've
regarded tensors

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.660
as being these sort of things
that operate on vectors.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.670
OK, but why not regard
vectors as things

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.740
that operate on one forms?

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.220
What this sort of tells you
is that this whole notion

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.980
of tensors being separate
from vectors that I talked

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:51.330
about before is kind of silly.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:54.080
So I'm going to revisit
the definition of a tensor

00:57:54.080 --> 00:58:05.970
that I started the
lecture off with like so.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.790
So a new and more
complete definition.

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:40.780
A tensor of type mn is a linear
mapping of m1 forms and n

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:47.085
vectors to the Lorentz scalars.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.635
In this definition-- so we've
already introduced zero,

00:58:53.635 --> 00:58:54.980
one tensors.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.090
Those are one forms.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.400
One zero tensors are vectors.

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.040
Furthermore, as I
kind of emphasized

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.650
when I wrote this sentence
here, the distinction

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.980
between the slots that operate
on vectors and the slots that

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.800
operate on one forms,
it's nice for getting some

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.965
of the basic foundations laid.

00:59:23.965 --> 00:59:25.340
This is one of
those places where

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.170
now that the scaffolding
is in place--

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:29.128
we've had the scaffolding
in place for a while,

00:59:29.128 --> 00:59:31.140
but this wall of our
edifice is pretty steady,

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.200
so we can kick the
scaffolding away.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.099
We can sort of lose
this distinction.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.590
The metric lets us
convert the nature

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:51.880
of the slots on a tensor.

00:59:51.880 --> 01:00:05.710
So if I have an mn tensor and
I use the metric to lower,

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:10.760
that means I make it an m
minus one n plus one tensor.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:22.185
So an example would
be, if I have a tensor

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:36.573
r mu beta gamma delta and
I lower that first index,

01:00:36.573 --> 01:00:38.615
so this went from something
that operates on one,

01:00:38.615 --> 01:00:40.220
one form and three vectors.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.170
Now, it's one it
operates on four-vectors.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.190
Likewise using the inverse
metric, you can raise--

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.660
and just for completeness,
let's write that out.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:18.640
So an example of this would be
if I have some tensor su beta

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:27.735
gamma, and let's say I
raised that first index

01:01:27.735 --> 01:01:28.860
to get something like this.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.687
OK, so let's see.

01:01:35.687 --> 01:01:37.270
In my last couple
of minutes-- recall,

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:38.900
I do have to leave a little
bit early today, because I

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.067
need to introduce a speaker.

01:01:40.067 --> 01:01:44.800
But I just want to wrap up
one thing kind of quickly.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:52.560
I've spent a bunch of time
talking about basis objects.

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:03.810
And I'm going to go through
this fairly quickly.

01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:05.880
The notes, if you want to
see a few more details,

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.713
you're welcome to
download and look at them.

01:02:07.713 --> 01:02:10.860
They're not really
tricky or super critical.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.782
We know we have basis
objects for vectors,

01:02:12.782 --> 01:02:14.990
which hopefully you have
pretty good intuition about.

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:18.080
We have basis objects for one
forms, where your intuition is

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.580
perhaps a little
bit more befuddled,

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.440
but it'll come with time.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.890
So you might think, uh, now
I've got two index tenors.

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.200
I've got three index tensors.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.212
There's a four index
tensor on the board.

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:30.170
Scott's probably going
to write 17 index tensor

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:31.295
on the board at some point.

01:02:31.295 --> 01:02:34.443
Do I need a basis object
for every one of those?

01:02:34.443 --> 01:02:35.735
So in other words, do we need--

01:02:45.552 --> 01:02:46.760
glad that's caught on video--

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.110
do I need to be able
to say something

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:56.210
like the abstract
metric tensor is

01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:02.055
these components times some kind
of a two index basis object?

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.940
Do I need to do
something like this?

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.640
Cutting to the chase,
the answer is no.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.097
Basis one forms and
vectors are sufficient.

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:41.610
So what we're going
to do is, abstractly

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:44.340
just imagine that if
I do have a tensor,

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.860
I kind of have an outer product.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:51.000
I have both of the basis
objects attached to this thing,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and each one is just
attached to those two slots.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:06.012
OK, so in this particular case,
my two index basis two-form

01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:07.470
that would go with
this thing here,

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:10.020
the thing with
two indices on it,

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.595
I'm just going to
regard this as--

01:04:11.595 --> 01:04:16.160
I'll abstractly write this
as just an outer product

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.340
on the basis one forms.

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:27.380
If I ever need a basis object
for a tensor like this,

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:33.370
I will just regard this as
an outer product of these two

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:33.950
things.

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:35.533
So what's going on
with that notation?

01:04:35.533 --> 01:04:36.592
What does this mean?

01:04:36.592 --> 01:04:38.050
Don't lose too much
sleep about it.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.600
It's basically saying that I
have separate objects attached

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.420
to all of my different
indices, and they're

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.000
kind of coming along here and
giving a sense of direction

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.060
to these things.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.233
So for instance, if I have
some kind of a tensor--

01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:51.400
I mean, a great one, which
we're going to talk about

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.300
in just a little bit.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.570
It's a quantity known
as the stress energy

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:20.340
tensor, in which
I can abstractly

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.925
think of the tensor as having--

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.020
not just a [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.990
It will have two components.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.490
And I can think of
it as essentially

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:35.497
pointing in two different
directions at once.

01:05:35.497 --> 01:05:37.830
Now, we're going to talk about
this in a lot more detail

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.588
in a couple of weeks.

01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:41.130
Actually, not even
a couple of weeks.

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.420
A couple of lectures.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.140
What I'm going to teach you is
that the alpha beta component

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.250
of the stress energy
tensor tells me

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:52.620
about the flux of form
momentum component alpha

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.128
in the beta direction.

01:05:55.128 --> 01:05:56.670
And so this is
basically just saying,

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:59.040
when I think of it as
the actual object, not

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.010
just the representation
according to some observer,

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:06.530
here is the thing that gives
me the direction of my four

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.250
momentum, and here
is the direction

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:10.350
in which it is flowing.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:13.170
And sometimes, we will make
more complicated objects.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:16.560
And so you might
need to imagine--

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.280
here's one which I actually
wrote down in my notes here--

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.780
there will be times
when we're going

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:39.750
to care about a tensor which at
least abstractly, we might need

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:44.175
to regard as having this whole
set of sort of vomitous basis

01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:45.800
vectors coming along
for the ride here.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:50.770
And it is actually
fairly important

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:54.645
to have all these things
that are in place.

01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:56.020
Where I will just
conclude things

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:59.170
for today is that the place
where it is particularly

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.260
important to remember that we
kind of sometimes almost just

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.230
implicitly have these
things coming along

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.070
for the ride here--

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:21.037
it's important when we
calculate derivatives.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:35.010
So I gave you guys an example
of a directional derivative

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:37.310
for a scalar field that
filled all its spacetime.

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:39.750
I imagine that there was some
trajectory of an observer

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.160
moving through this.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.780
Now, imagine it isn't a scalar
field that fills all of,

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.330
spacetime but it's
a tensor field.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.862
Here's t.

01:08:03.862 --> 01:08:05.550
We'll say this is
the y direction.

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:07.440
This is the x direction.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.440
Here's my observer moving
through all this thing.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.990
And again, I'm going to
say that this trajectory is

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:17.380
characterized by a
four velocity, dxt tau,

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:28.270
and I'm going to imagine that
there is some tensor field that

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:35.580
fills all of spacetime
when I go and calculate

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.300
the derivative of
this thing, when

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.160
we're working in
special relativity

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.410
where we are right now, these
guys are going to be constant,

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:45.611
so it doesn't really matter.

01:08:45.611 --> 01:08:47.069
But soon, we're
going to generalize

01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:51.420
to more complicated geometries,
more complicated spacetimes,

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.310
and the basis objects
will themselves

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:55.620
vary as I move along
the trajectory.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.279
And I will need to--
in order to have

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.350
a notion of a derivative
that is a properly

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:02.948
formed geometric
object, I'm going

01:09:02.948 --> 01:09:05.490
to have to worry about how the
basis objects change as I move

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.585
along this trajectory as well.

01:09:07.585 --> 01:09:09.210
So that tends to just
make the analysis

01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:11.140
a little bit more complicated.

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.545
I have a few notes about
this that I will put up

01:09:13.545 --> 01:09:16.170
on to the web page, but I don't
want to go into too much detail

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:17.640
beyond that until
we actually get

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.620
into some of the details
of these derivatives.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.430
So I'm just going to
leave it at that for now.

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:31.240
So yeah, I'll just say,
the derivative in principle

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:43.500
and quite often in
practice, it will

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.640
depend on how these guys
vary in space and time.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.400
And let me just say, you guys
kind of already know that.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.720
Because when you
studied E&M, you

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.540
got these somewhat
complicated formulas

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:07.487
for things like the divergence
and curl and stuff like that.

01:10:07.487 --> 01:10:09.070
And those are
essential, because those

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:11.320
are notions of derivative
where you are taking

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.030
into account the fact that
when you're in a curvilinear

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.405
coordinate system, your basis
vectors are shifting as you

01:10:15.405 --> 01:10:17.008
move from point to point.

01:10:17.008 --> 01:10:18.550
The stuff we're
going to get out this

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:20.140
will look a little
bit different,

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.780
and it comes to the fact, as I
emphasized in my last lecture,

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.700
that we are going to
tend to use what we call

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:28.220
a coordinate basis, whereas when
you guys learn stuff in E&M,

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.460
you were using what's known
as an orthonormal basis.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.085
And it does lead to
slight differences.

01:10:32.085 --> 01:10:33.730
There's a mapping between them.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.530
Not that hard to
figure it out, but we

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:37.870
don't need to get into
those weeds just now.

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:42.400
All right, so I will pick it
up from there on Thursday.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.980
So I'll begin with a brief
recap of everything we did.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:48.010
The primary thing which I
really want to emphasize more

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:52.300
than anything is this
board plus this idea

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.670
that the metric can be
used to raise and lower

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:56.440
the indices of a tensor.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.720
At this point,
talking about vectors,

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.860
talking about one forms,
many of you in a math class

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.170
probably learned about
contravariant vector components

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:07.210
and covariant vector components.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:10.450
Once you've got a metric,
it's kind of like, who cares?

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:12.350
You can just go from
one to the other.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:15.940
And that's why I tend
to, almost religiously, I

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.780
avoid the terms covariant
and contravariant,

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.832
and I just say,
upstairs and downstairs.

01:11:19.832 --> 01:11:21.790
Because I can flip back
and forth between them,

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:24.377
and there's really no
physical meaning in them.

01:11:24.377 --> 01:11:25.960
You have to think
carefully about what

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.730
is physically
measurable, and it has

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:30.940
nothing to do with whether
it's covariant or convariant,

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.562
upstairs or downstairs.

01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:34.270
All right, I will end
there, since I have

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:36.390
to go and introduce someone.

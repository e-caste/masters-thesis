[CLICKING]

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:12.550
JONATHAN GRUBER: All right.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.760
Why don't we get started?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.130
Today, we're going to continue
our discussion of producer

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.120
theory.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.400
Once again, to remember
to put this in context,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.280
the first few lectures were
working consumer theory

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.380
to help us derive
a demand curve.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.880
Now we're working
on producer theory

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.550
to help us come up
with a supply curve.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.740
We started last time
by talking about how

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.730
producers profit maximizes,
and the profit maximization

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.137
implies cost minimization.

00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:40.720
Therefore, to maximize
profits, you're

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.450
going to want to produce
as efficiently as possible.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.140
And basically, to
do that, we need

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.860
to understand how your
costs vary with your output.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.080
If you're going to produce
at an efficient level,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.350
you need to understand how what
your costs are going to vary

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.273
with your level of production.

00:00:58.273 --> 00:00:59.940
So essentially, our
goal of this lecture

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.470
is to develop a cost curve--

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.720
develop a curve which tells you
how the cost of your production

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.330
varies with how
much you produce.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.640
And that's what we're
after in this lecture.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.660
OK?

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.730
So we're going to start
with the short run

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.402
and then turn to the long run.

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.360
So start with developing
a short-run cost curve

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.300
and then turn to a long-run.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.090
OK?

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.982
And to make this lecture sort
of mathematically coherent,

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:26.440
throughout the
whole lecture, we'll

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.680
work with our favorite
functional form--

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.960
a production form
of the function q

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.660
equals the square root
of L times K. Remember,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.190
firms produce goods--

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.910
little q-- using two
inputs, labor and capital.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.210
Labor is a variable input.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.030
That means you can change it in
the short run and the long run.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750
Capital is a fixed input,
which means that you can only

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.670
change it in the long run.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.690
OK?

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.170
So in the short run, we're going
to have two kinds of costs.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.630
We're going to have
fixed costs, which

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.720
are going to come from a
fixed level of capital,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.910
and we're going to
variable costs, which are

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.140
going to come from our labor.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.540
So we're going to have two
kinds of costs: fixed costs--

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.620
they're fixed, because
in the short run,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.570
you can't change the
level of capital--

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.950
and variable costs, which
are the costs of our labor.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.110
And then we're going
to have total costs.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.880
They're simply going to be
fixed costs plus variable costs.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.400
OK?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.540
So that's how we
think about costs.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.410
The costs of a firm's
production in the short run

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.600
is the sum of
their fixed costs--

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.190
i.e., their capital costs--

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.600
and the variable costs--

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.820
i.e., their labor costs.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.450
Now, we're going to show you
how you can turn a production

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.780
function into a cost function.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.820
And to do so, you simply
need to recognize that cost--

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.450
the costs of firms' production--

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.530
are simply the amount
of capital that

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.680
uses k bar times the price
of that capital, which we'll

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.900
call r, plus the amount
of labor it uses,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.980
times the price of that labor,
which we'll call W, the wage.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.680
OK?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.180
This is the easy part.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.680
Think of the amount
of hours of work

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.590
you use times the wage per
hour, or the amount of workers

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.360
times the salary per year.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.270
In any case, this is
easier to understand.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.170
Every additional
unit of labor comes

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.800
with a cost that is the
wage of that unit of labor.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.130
Think about an hourly model.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.650
Every hour you work at
your convenience store,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.960
they have to pay you the
minimum wage for that hour.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.460
OK?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.700
That's the cost of
that hour of labor.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.300
Capital is harder.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.370
We call r the rental rate.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.070
And the reason is because we
don't think of buying capital.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.840
Don't think of buying a machine.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.850
Think of renting a machine.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.750
The reason we do that is to
make the periodicity work.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.330
OK?

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.670
You don't buy a
worker, thank god.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.110
You rent that worker.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.200
And you rent that
worker at a price, w.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.000
So when the firm uses
your time, they're

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.900
renting your time an hour
at a time at a price, w.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.750
When we get machines,
think of a firm

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.420
as renting machines for a price,
r per machine per time period.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.140
OK?

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.177
So I understand firms
usually don't do this.

00:04:10.177 --> 00:04:11.260
They usually buy machines.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.060
And we'll come
back to even if you

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.940
buy a machine how it
effectively is like renting it,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.130
but for ease of
thinking about this,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.350
you want to think about
flows, not stocks.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.900
Think about the firm's
decision as renting a worker

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.260
at the price, w, or renting
a machine at the price, r.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.907
Yeah.

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:28.532
AUDIENCE: Kind of
like also we consider

00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:30.332
the gas and electricity
a machine can

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:31.330
use in productivity?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.110
JONATHAN GRUBER: All
that would be in there,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.277
and we'll come back to that.

00:04:33.277 --> 00:04:33.850
That's right.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.510
This is sort of the per period
cost of using a machine.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.010
This is the per period cost of
using a worker, is the wage.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.510
This is the per
period cost of using

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.300
a machine, which will include
all the costs of running

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.660
the machine as well as the costs
of renting the machine itself.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.177
OK?

00:04:52.177 --> 00:04:54.260
So later, we'll talk about
how to own the machine.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.000
And we'll come back to the
fact that you can actually

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.585
use r as a representation.

00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:57.245
It's not bad.

00:04:57.245 --> 00:04:59.120
But for now, just think
of renting a machine.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.610
Or if it's a building,
think of this as the rent

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.470
you pay on that building, OK?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.750
Not the cost to
build the building.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.800
Now, armed with our
production function--

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.812
and let's also say,
to make life easy--

00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:16.020
I did this wrong on my notes.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.140
So I hope the other
teachers figured it out.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.060
To make life easy, let's
say that the rental rate, r,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.260
we're going to say is
$10, and the wage rate, w,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.015
is going to be $5.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.350
Now, armed with a
production function,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.720
if you simply have the
production function

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.020
and these two prices, you
can derive the short-run cost

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.760
function.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.030
How do you do that?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.370
Well, just look at the math.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.060
We know that q equals
square root of L times

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.330
k bar in the short-run.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.550
L times k bar.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.660
OK?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.650
So inverting that simply
means that L equals q

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.500
squared over k bar.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.250
L equals q squared over k bar.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.760
OK?

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:24.260
And that means that cost
can be written as 10 k bar--

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.420
the price the rental
rate is 10, we

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.000
have k bar amount of capital--

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.460
plus 5q squared over k bar.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.980
That's our cost function.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.720
I just plugged in for L and
multiplied by the wage rate, w,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.470
which is 5.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.340
OK?

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.300
So for example, for a fixed
level of capital, this is cost.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.070
So for example, let's imagine
our short-run level of capital

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.935
is 1.

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:54.310
Let's imagine there's 1 unit
of capital in the short run,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.320
just to make the math easy.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:05.090
Then that simply says that
cost equals 10 plus 5q squared.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.570
And that's our cost function.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.620
10 plus 5q squared.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.550
We've just derived the
short-run cost function.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.400
10 is the fixed cost component.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.470
That doesn't vary with
the amount you produce.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.980
So there's no q part of this.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.740
5q squared is the
variable component.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.440
That varies with how
much you produce.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.630
So the cost function
is a fixed part,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.670
which comes from that one
fixed unit of capital,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.120
and the varying part,
which comes from the fact

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.370
that the amount of q drives
the amount of labor we need.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.240
OK?

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.270
Questions about that math?

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.060
All right.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.965
Now, armed with
this cost function,

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.670
let's write that
down again here.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.453
So C equals 10 plus 5q squared.

00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:55.370
That's going to be our
short-run cost function

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.030
we're going to work with.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.550
And remember, that short-run
cost function came directly

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.020
from that production function.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.340
To derive this
equation, all I needed

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.550
was that production function
and those two prices,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.930
and I derived it.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.680
OK.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.530
Armed with that,
we can define some

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.720
of the key concepts
that will drive

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.580
our entire analysis of firms.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.590
And the single most
important concept

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.320
is marginal cost, which
is what it sounds like--

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.100
the derivative costs
with respect to quantity.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.950
OK?

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.540
So in this, the marginal
cost is delta c delta q.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.860
OK?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.049
That's marginal cost.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:35.909
OK.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:41.425
We'll also care about average
cost, which is just c over q.

00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:42.800
It's very important
in this class

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.950
to keep our marginals
separate from our averages.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.950
The average is simply over the
entire range of production.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.410
What is the average cost
to produce each unit?

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.740
The marginal is what's the cost
of producing the next unit?

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.020
And since production
functions are nonlinear,

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.580
those will not be
the same, generally.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.080
OK.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.600
Average will not equal
marginal in general,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.960
because a nonlinear function
delta c delta q is not

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.560
the same as c/q.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.930
OK?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.960
So we can actually graph
these in figure 6-1.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.430
Figure 6-1 shows the cost
curves for this cost function

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.370
I just wrote down, which comes
from that production function.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.510
OK?

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.620
So you can see that the
marginal cost, as I said,

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.045
is delta c delta q.

00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:28.980
Well, that's 10q.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.480
So the marginal cost, the cost
of producing the next unit,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.550
rises with the number of units.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.300
Which makes sense.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.123
The cost has a q
squared term in it,

00:09:39.123 --> 00:09:40.540
So obviously, the
marginal cost is

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.450
going to have a q term in it.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.620
So basically, the
more you produce,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.560
the higher your marginal cost.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.935
The more unit you need to
produce, the more the little q,

00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:50.800
the higher your marginal cost.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.150
Average cost is this sort
of funky shaped thing,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.560
where it's--

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.350
which is 10 over q plus 5q--

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.020
I just divided this by q--

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.120
where it's first declining
and then increasing.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.440
Why is that?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.340
Why is average cost first
declining and then increasing?

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.900
We've seen what--
just intuitively?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.960
Why is that?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.880
Why in general in the short
run would we expect that?

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.886
Average cost first to
fall and then increase.

00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:21.640
Anyone have ideas?

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.347
Yeah.

00:10:22.347 --> 00:10:25.245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
start up [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:27.370
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well--
no, but it's falling first.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.770
So why is it falling first?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.752
It's about that-- yeah.

00:10:30.752 --> 00:10:32.544
AUDIENCE: They have a
really high average--

00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:35.510
or first fixed cost is not
[INAUDIBLE] the more you make,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.490
the lower that is.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.448
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:39.406
The first units are paying
off your fixed costs

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.323
if you think about it.

00:10:40.323 --> 00:10:41.990
Well, the first unit
you sell, basically

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.450
you start with this
huge fixed cost.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.105
So actually, by
selling two units, yes,

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.730
you get the variable
cost, second unit,

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.370
but you get to pay off the
fixed cost, the first unit.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.660
So look at here on this graph.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.620
We show average fixed costs
and average variable costs

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.410
Average fixed costs are 10/q.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.950
If you only produce one unit,
your average fixed cost is $10.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.300
To produce two units it's $5.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.130
With every unit you produce,
your average fixed cost

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.630
is falling.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.230
You're paying off
that fixed cost.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.850
Average variable cost rises.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.650
Every unit you
produce, you're getting

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.720
more and more variable cost.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.180
You put those together,
and you get a function that

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.430
first declines and then rises.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.893
You first pay off
your fixed costs,

00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:24.310
so your average
costs are falling,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.080
then your marginal cost--
then you start to rise,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.038
because you've got marginal
costs that increase

00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:29.470
with quantity produced.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.220
And critically,
the marginal cost

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.920
intersects the
average cost curve

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.290
at the minimum of average cost.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.810
And that's just mathematical.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.590
If you have any function,
and you take the average,

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.850
then the minimum is going to be
a derivative that basically--

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:55.070
before you get to here, 1.5
units, before 1.5 units,

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.828
average cost is
above marginal cost,

00:11:58.828 --> 00:12:00.620
because you're paying
off your fixed costs.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.500
Once you get beyond
1.5 units, average cost

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.220
is below marginal cost.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.868
So average cost
hits marginal cost

00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:08.160
at the minimum of average cost.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.020
Yeah.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.360
AUDIENCE: In a
relatively large company,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.685
eventually doesn't really
worry about their fixed cost,

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.560
because if they're having
a lot more workers,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.160
their entire cost is going
to be considered basically--

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.430
JONATHAN GRUBER:
In the short run.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.930
It depends on this function.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.750
You said large, but large
can be defined in two ways.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.740
But absolute true.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.770
Certainly, if we take
this very function,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:35.330
for large enough q's average
fixed cost asymptotes to 0.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.180
10 over infinity is 0.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.790
So for large enough q's, the
average fixed cost goes away--

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.490
in the short run.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.870
Remember, we're in the short
run with these fixed costs.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.530
OK.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.727
Now, so other questions.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:49.310
Good question.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.320
Other questions about that?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.440
So that's our basic
intuition, the short run--

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.720
is that at first our
costs are super high,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.080
because you've got to pay--
you had to build the plant.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.618
But then over time,
that plant cost falls,

00:13:02.618 --> 00:13:04.160
and then your only
costs is basically

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.660
the fact you've got to
hire more workers if you

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.535
want to produce more.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.730
Now, what we want to notice
is that in the short run

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.780
there is a really
close relationship--

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.290
one was the key relationship
between marginal cost

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.365
and the marginal
product of labor,

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.490
which we defined last time.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.370
Remember, the marginal
product of labor was dq dL.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.895
How much-- remember
digging a hole

00:13:30.895 --> 00:13:32.270
and diminishing
marginal product?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.820
That each additional worker,
for a fixed level of capital,

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.800
is less and less
productive, right?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.220
We talked about that last time.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.150
Well, the marginal cost of
production is, as I said,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.170
equal to delta c over delta q.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.210
OK?

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.960
Well, we know from last
time that delta q over delta

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.600
L we defined as the
marginal product of labor.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:04.190
Plugging those and-- so we know
marginal cost is delta c delta

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.140
q.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.010
And we can write this-- if you
take the derivative of the cost

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.230
function, so our general
cost function up there--

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.540
see the cost function
at the top there?

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.980
Take the derivative of that with
respect to the amount of labor.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.170
Well, the first term drops
out, because it's fixed.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:30.966
So you can rewrite delta c delta
q as w times delta L delta q--

00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:33.730
w times delta L delta q.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.680
Right.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.200
I just rewrote delta
c-- q delta w-- god.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.700
Brutal.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.650
Sorry, guys.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.640
w times delta L over delta q.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.140
OK.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.990
A little bit better.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.490
OK.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.948
I read that, because I just
took the derivative of the cost

00:14:49.948 --> 00:14:51.255
function.

00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:53.130
First term drops out,
we take the derivative.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.080
Second term, I just took
the derivative here,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.050
or the discrete derivative, and
I just said, delta c delta q

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.323
is w times delta L delta q.

00:15:00.323 --> 00:15:01.740
Well, we know the
marginal product

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.890
is delta q over
delta L. So we can

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:12.090
rewrite marginal cost as w over
the marginal product of labor.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.690
The marginal cost
is equal to w over

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.610
the marginal product of labor.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.400
And that makes sense.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.160
The marginal cost
of the next unit

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.310
will be higher the
higher the wage

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.820
and lower the more
productive the worker.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.210
Making another unit with a super
productive worker is cheap.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.335
Making another unit with
a very unproductive worker

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:39.320
is expensive.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.830
So essentially, the more you
pay them for each hour of work,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.870
the higher your marginal cost.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.510
But the less they get
done each hour of work,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.850
the higher your marginal cost.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.060
So that's why, roughly
speaking, firms

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.540
might want to pay a lot to
people who are high skilled.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.407
So you might say, gee, why are
they paying my friend twice

00:15:58.407 --> 00:15:58.990
what I'm paid?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.750
Well, maybe your friend's
twice as productive as you.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.310
That would make-- or two and
a half times as productive

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:03.810
as you.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.110
And that would make sense.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.183
So we can't just say
that it's a mistake

00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:08.350
to pay someone higher wages.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.975
We have to consider their wages
relative to how productive they

00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:12.910
are.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:18.110
And that's a key relationship
we'll come back to.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.370
OK?

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.950
Question about that?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.790
All right.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.300
That's the short run.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.860
Now let's go to
the long run, which

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.820
gets a little more interesting.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.278
Actually, let's
write in that side.

00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:29.700
I'll switch to this side today.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.408
Switch things up.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600
This way, this side, I
block you less, probably.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.280
So I should do this side.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:38.850
OK.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.020
Long run cost curves.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.010
OK.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.150
Long run cost.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:50.720
Now, here what gets interesting,
is now K is no longer fixed.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.620
Now we get to choose
our input mix.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.700
And now our goal is going to
be, how do we choose our input

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.410
mix to minimize costs?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.610
That's our goal here.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.599
How we going to choose the
mix of workers and machines

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:11.290
to produce a given
quantity most efficiently?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.220
Now, that optimal mix may
change with the quantity.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.220
So we're going to start.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.220
We're going to do
this in two steps.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.060
First, we're going to say, for
a given quantity picked out

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.720
of a hat, what's the right
mix of labor and capital

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.480
that minimizes the cost of
producing that quantity, given

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.280
our production function?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.140
Then we're going to
say, as the quantity

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.530
varies how does that change
the optimal mix of L and K?

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.190
And does it?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.860
So two steps.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.040
First say, for a
given quantity, what's

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.600
the right L and K
to minimize costs

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.830
of producing that quantity?

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.590
Then ask, well, as we vary
the quantity how does L--

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.900
how do L and K vary optimally?

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.420
OK.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.850
So basically, we want to find
the economically efficient

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.720
combination of L and K
which is a combination that

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.470
produces goods at minimum cost.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.343
And to do this, we are
going to write down--

00:18:01.343 --> 00:18:03.010
to derive this we're
going to write down

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.610
what we call isocost curves.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.170
Isocost curves.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.360
Remember last time
we did isoquants,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.760
Which felt a lot like
the difference curves?

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.840
Isocosts are going to feel a
lot like budget constraints.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.560
Isocost curves are essentially
the firm's budget constraint.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.120
They're essentially
mappings of the function

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.420
c equals wL plus rK--

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.400
essentially, mappings for
different amounts of K and L

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.520
of the function c
equals rK plus wL.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.930
So if you look at figure 6-2,
here we see our isocost lines.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.790
OK.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.870
So let's talk about
this for a second.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.960
So for example, take the
middle one, the $100 isocost.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.470
This is saying, what
combinations of labor

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.000
and capital cost you $100?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.220
Well, with a rental rate
of $10 and a wage of $5,

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.490
that means you can have
10 machines and no workers

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.473
or 20 workers and no machines,
or some combination in between.

00:19:07.473 --> 00:19:08.890
This is just a
budget constraints.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.682
It's just saying, given
the amount of money

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:14.168
you want to spend,
given your cost,

00:19:14.168 --> 00:19:15.960
how many machines and
workers can you have?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.127
The difference is,
we don't start--

00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:19.710
I didn't start this
example by saying,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.330
your parents give you x dollars.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.628
That's why firm theory is
harder than consumer theory.

00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:25.920
I pin down the consumer theory
problem much more easily

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.720
by saying, your parents
give you x dollars, which

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.012
told you which line to derive--

00:19:29.012 --> 00:19:29.512
graph.

00:19:29.512 --> 00:19:30.510
I don't have that here.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.718
I haven't told you that here.

00:19:31.718 --> 00:19:33.990
So you have to graph a
series of isocost curves,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.778
because you don't know what the
optimal cost is going to be.

00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:38.070
That's to be pinned down later.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.260
That's what makes
supply theory harder.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.670
You have to draw the series.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.250
So you draw these series
of isocost curves--

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.310
different combinations
that represent different

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.350
amounts, different
totals of cost.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.010
And of course, the slope
of that isocost curve

00:19:54.010 --> 00:20:01.382
is delta K delta L,
or minus w over r.

00:20:01.382 --> 00:20:02.090
That's the slope.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:09.070
Or in this case, minus 0.5.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.652
Now, those of you
thinking ahead--

00:20:10.652 --> 00:20:12.610
I know you guys are very
insightful as a class,

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.440
I'm sure many of you
are thinking ahead--

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.200
might think, gee,
that slope might

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.480
change as the number of
workers and machines change.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.092
Could you imagine the relative
price of capital labor changes

00:20:22.092 --> 00:20:24.550
in different costs-- and it
might, and we'll put that aside

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.720
for now.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.290
For now, assuming for every
relevant quantity these prices

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.500
$5 and $10 are fixed--

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.250
let's ignore where
those prices come from.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.208
They're just given now.

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.153
We'll come back to that later.

00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:38.570
Like I said, this course is
sort of like peeling an onion.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.570
We raise things, then we come
back go to the next layer.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.660
Where'd that come from?

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.633
Right now-- we'll tell you
where w and r come from.

00:20:44.633 --> 00:20:46.550
Right now we're just
going to take them fixed.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.380
And we'll assume they're
always $5 and $10,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.900
regardless of the
amount produced.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.020
OK.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.312
Now, here's the question.

00:20:54.312 --> 00:20:55.770
You're a firm that
wants to release

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.700
a certain amount of units.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.350
You have a production
function and a cost function.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:07.210
How do you graphically figure
out the right combination

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.190
of capital labor
to use to produce

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.100
a certain amount of units?

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.475
Yeah.

00:21:13.475 --> 00:21:17.690
AUDIENCE: Could it be the
tension between the isoquant

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.960
and the isocost curves?

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.970
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's exactly right.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.880
Just as I asked you, what is
the right combination of pizza

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.090
and cookies, and
you told me that it

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.580
was the tangency
of the indifference

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.810
curve and the budget constraint,
it's the exact same logic here.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.000
The optimal mix of
capital and labor

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.770
comes from the tangency of
the isoquant with the isocost,

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.470
as we see in figure 6-3.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.420
And ignore the, like--

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.545
somehow that curve is sort
of connected at the top.

00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:49.003
It's sort of a
glitch a PowerPoint.

00:21:49.003 --> 00:21:49.740
Just ignore that.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.620
It's not actually like
a square or a trapezoid.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.877
It's just a curve.

00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:54.960
What would you call that--

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.127
the curve and the two sides.

00:21:56.127 --> 00:21:57.920
Is that a-- that's
not a trapezoid.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.650
That's not-- it's not a polygon.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.730
It's just a line.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.080
All right.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.360
So basically-- is
there a name for that?

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.350
A curve and two lines?

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.745
I don't think so.

00:22:07.745 --> 00:22:08.870
It's just a polygon, right?

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:09.380
OK.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.930
So it's not a polygon,
it's just a curve.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.160
So the curve is the isoquant
for the square root of 12.5.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.700
What do I mean by that?

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.730
I mean that is the combination
of capital and labor

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.230
that delivers square root
of 12.5 units of production.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.070
So what that curve is
all possible combinations

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.310
of capital and
labor that deliver

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.158
square root of 12.5 units.

00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:39.700
Just like the indifference curve
is all possible combinations

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.980
of pizza and cookies that
leaves you equally happy,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.355
this is all possible
combinations

00:22:43.355 --> 00:22:45.523
of capital and
labor that leads you

00:22:45.523 --> 00:22:46.690
to a given production level.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.500
And as we said, the
further out the isoquant,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.810
the more you can produce.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.830
So you want to produce as much
as you can given the prices you

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.250
face in the market.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.160
Well, those prices
you face in the market

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.780
are delivered by
the isocost curve.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.080
So the tangency is the best--

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.450
is the cost minimizing point.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.080
That's when you're producing
the most you can given the costs

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.575
you face in the market--

00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:14.950
the most you can, given the
costs you face in the market.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.090
And that tangency
condition-- once again,

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.550
considering our parallels
to consumer theory,

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:27.000
the tangency condition is going
to deliver that the marginal

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.130
product--

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.520
is going to deliver that the
marginal product of labor

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.460
over the marginal product of
capital, which we remember

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.830
called last time
the marginal rate

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:45.883
of technical substitution,
is going to be equal to w/r--

00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.550
actually, the negative
of these is going

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.290
to be equal to each other.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.915
But we'll just cross
out the negatives.

00:23:49.915 --> 00:23:52.540
So the negative of
MPL over MPK, which

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.240
we called the marginal rate
of technical substitution,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.780
is equal to the negative of w/r.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.602
The slope, the optimal
point, is where

00:24:01.602 --> 00:24:03.310
the marginal rate of
technical subsection

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:09.650
equals the slope, which is
the wage to rental rate ratio.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.150
Alternatively-- I don't know
if anyone besides me likes this

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:22.620
intuition-- we can rewrite
this as MPL/w equals MPK/r,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.170
my bang-for-the-buck
formulation that I like--

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.310
that the next dollar
of wages, if you ask,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.070
should I spend next dollar
on wages or machines,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.770
you should do it until
the next dollar of wages

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.260
delivers you the same return
as the next dollar of machines.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.370
This is what you get for the
next dollar of wages, MPL/w.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.100
This it what you get for the
next dollar of machines, MPK/r.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.590
You want to continue to trade
off machines and workers

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.900
until that condition is true.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.600
So let's actually now solve
for this for our example.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.850
Let's actually solve for that.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.500
If we solve for this, we know
that the marginal product

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:14.700
of labor, which is dq dL, is 0.5
times K over square root of K

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.910
times L. And the marginal
product of capital,

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:26.820
which is dq dK, equals 0.5
times L over the square root--

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.015
0.5 times L over the square
root of K times L. Just taking

00:25:31.015 --> 00:25:32.390
the derivative of
the-- all I did

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.070
was take the derivative of
the production function.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.928
So therefore, putting
these together,

00:25:38.928 --> 00:25:40.720
we're going to-- we
know that marginal rate

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.840
of technical substitution
in this example

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:50.620
is equal to minus K over L.
That's not a general formula.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.898
That's just this example.

00:25:51.898 --> 00:25:53.690
The marginal rate of
technical substitution

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.610
is equal to the negative of
the ratio of capital to labor.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.170
We also know that
the wage rate--

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.720
we also know we want to set
this equal to the negative

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.750
of the wage rate--

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.000
I'm sorry, the wage
rental rate ratio.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.170
And we know that's negative 1/2.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:18.030
We know that's a 1/2, because
that's 5 and that's 10.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.540
So we want to set the marginal
rate of technical substitution

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.880
to the wage rental
rate ratio, which

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.120
means we set minus K over
L equal to minus 1/2.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:34.890
Or at the optimum, that means
that your labor, your capital,

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.080
at the optimum-- that means
the amount of capital--

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.830
should be half as much
as the amount of labor.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.390
In this example, we just solved
for the efficient combination

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.980
of inputs, the
efficient combination

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.210
is you should use capital
to labor in a ratio of 1/2.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:55.890
You should use half as
much capital as use labor.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.140
So let me pause there.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.120
And let's talk about
where this is coming from.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.002
Yeah.

00:27:02.002 --> 00:27:04.460
AUDIENCE: So does that mean
that at any given price of cost

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.540
[INAUDIBLE] line, that is
the optimal point where

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.790
it will be tangent [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:10.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.630
Exactly.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.180
That's the graphic intuition.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.010
Let's come to the
economics intuition.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.190
The economics intuition
is the following.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.540
The production function
delivers this relationship--

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.540
that the marginal rate
of technical substitution

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.860
was minus K over
L. In other words,

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.178
when you're producing goods,
given this production function

00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:31.970
you're indifferent
between the next machine

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:32.803
and the next worker.

00:27:32.803 --> 00:27:34.928
That's just the way this
production function worked

00:27:34.928 --> 00:27:35.450
out--

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.850
that one more machine
delivers you the same amount

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.550
as one more worker.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.660
Now, I've just told
you that one machine

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.580
costs half of one more worker.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.110
So which you want more of?

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.100
No?

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.370
One machine delivers the
same return as one worker.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.960
You want more workers.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.660
Workers cost half machines,
they're equally productive,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.330
so you want more workers.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.400
So the optimal
amount of machines

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.140
is going to be half as many
as the number of workers.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.380
You want more workers,
because you're indifferent--

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.910
look at that
production function.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.190
You're indifferent.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.290
You don't give a shit
about L versus K.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.190
They're the same to you.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.180
You're a hard capitalist, man.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.770
Machine or worker,
you don't care.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.950
But the market's telling you
you can get a worker for half

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.710
the price of a machine.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.660
So you, as a good cost
minimizing capitalist,

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.415
take twice as many
workers as machines.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.835
And that's the outcome
that you get here.

00:28:41.835 --> 00:28:42.710
Questions about that?

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.080
OK.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.990
So that's basically what
we do to derive this.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:57.360
Now, what I want to do is
take this and then derive

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.470
our ultimate goal, which is,
what is the long run cost

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.430
function?

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.860
That's sort of what we--
why we started this lecture.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.318
What is the long
run cost function?

00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:07.215
Let's do the math.

00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:08.790
We'll do the math in five steps.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:19.880
Step one, q equals square
root of K times L. Step two,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.040
we know from up there
that K/L equals w/r.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:30.295
We derived that, leading us
to the conclusion that K--

00:29:30.295 --> 00:29:31.920
lead us to the
conclusion that K equals

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.180
1/2 L. We just derived that.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:46.450
Therefore, we can rewrite q as
the square root of 1/2 times L

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:52.150
squared, just substituting
it, because K equals 1/2 L.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.860
Therefore, we can
solve for L is going

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.760
to be square root of 2 over q.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:10.330
And K is going to be square
root of 2 over 2 over q.

00:30:18.473 --> 00:30:22.090
L is square root of 2 over q,
K is square root of 2 over 2

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.480
over q.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.960
I'm sorry-- no, not over q.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.460
I'm sorry.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.810
That's my bed.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:28.920
Error.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.550
Error.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.290
Go back.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.600
Should always look at my notes.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.590
It's square root of 2 times q.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.610
My bad.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.290
L is square root of 2 times q.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.460
And K is square root
of 2 over 2 times q.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.060
OK.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:55.110
Therefore, armed
with this L and K,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.990
we can rewrite
our cost function.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:03.990
So step five is that the cost
function-- given this stuff,

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:11.824
the cost function equals r
times square root of 2 times q--

00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:14.880
I'm sorry, r times square
root of 2 over 2 times q--

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.180
plus w times square
root of 2 times q.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.740
I just plugged in the optimal
L and K into my cost function.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.260
Now I can plug in
the 10 and the 5

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:38.170
to get C equals 10 times
square root of 2 times q.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.040
And I'm done.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.992
I just derived
the cost function.

00:31:41.992 --> 00:31:43.200
That's what we came here for.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.143
This is what you got up this
morning and wanted to see.

00:31:46.143 --> 00:31:47.560
You got up this
morning, you said,

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.210
I want to know how
does the cost of a firm

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.220
vary with the
quantity it produces?

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.400
And I've just told you.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.010
This tells you how
the costs that you pay

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:59.660
vary the quantity you produce.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.740
And I did that by deriving
the optimal mix of L and K

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.180
you want to use, and
then simply imposing

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.802
the prices of those two,
and I get a cost function.

00:32:11.802 --> 00:32:12.612
Yeah.

00:32:12.612 --> 00:32:14.570
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you
be adding the two terms?

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.840
JONATHAN GRUBER: I'm sorry?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.670
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you
be adding the two terms?

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:17.930
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Which two terms?

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:18.380
Oh, I see.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:18.880
Yeah, plus.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.490
I'm sorry.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.100
You're right.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.600
My bad.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.490
That's a plus.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.010
Thanks.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.230
This is the most math I'll
do in a lecture all year,

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.503
you'll be pleased to know.

00:32:28.503 --> 00:32:30.170
It's why it's my least
favorite lecture.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:30.670
Yeah?

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.700
AUDIENCE: So is
five generally true?

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: You mean this
particular functional form?

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:37.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.180
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.800
This is all dependent
on that production

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.717
function I wrote down.

00:32:40.717 --> 00:32:42.830
What's generally true is this--

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.300
or actually, K wouldn't be--

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.767
what's generally true
is just C equals--

00:32:46.767 --> 00:32:48.350
in the long run,
what's generally true

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:52.310
is C equals wL plus rK.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.020
That's what's generally true.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.830
I just made--

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.310
But what I've showed you
is, given three things--

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.240
a production-- all I gave you
was a production function,

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.210
a wage rate, and a rental rate.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.400
Given those three
things, you can then

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.880
derive the cost function.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.042
Given those three things, you
can derive the cost function.

00:33:14.042 --> 00:33:16.500
In fact, given two things you
can derive the cost function.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.632
You could actually derive the
cost function given one thing--

00:33:19.632 --> 00:33:21.090
given just the
production function,

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:25.750
derive the cost function as a
function of these input prices.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.340
OK.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.000
So that's a lot of
results from one function,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.340
from one production function.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.380
Now, other question about this?

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.470
Other math I got wrong?

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.530
Sorry about that.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.180
Yeah.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.920
AUDIENCE: Sorry, could you
just repeat the three inputs

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.520
that you were using?

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.760
JONATHAN GRUBER:
[INAUDIBLE] all I used.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.810
Somebody tell me.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.270
What do you need to get
the magical cost function?

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.080
What three things do you need?

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.490
Yeah.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.362
AUDIENCE: w and r and then q.

00:33:52.362 --> 00:33:54.170
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, w, r, and--

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:54.923
what about q?

00:33:54.923 --> 00:33:56.840
You need q, but what
about-- what do you need?

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.297
w, r, and the
production function.

00:34:00.297 --> 00:34:01.880
So armed with the
production function,

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.990
that mathematical equation, this
mathematical equation, w and r,

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.580
I'm done.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.080
Everything I've
done in this lecture

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.750
comes from those three things.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.219
The math is hard and annoying.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.380
We will have you practice it.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.380
You will not like it.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.820
OK.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.320
It's just kind of
what you've got to do.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:21.820
All right?

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.695
I don't like it, you're
not going to like it.

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:25.237
It's just what we've
got to do to get

00:34:25.237 --> 00:34:26.510
to the more interesting stuff.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.010
OK?

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.800
Yeah.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.620
AUDIENCE: Is the bar on the K?

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.260
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's
fixed in the short run.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:32.998
The bar on the--

00:34:32.998 --> 00:34:34.540
shouldn't see a bar
on a K over here.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.159
That's all over here when
I was doing the short run.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.080
Yeah?

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.212
AUDIENCE: Can you use r and w in
order to get to the fifth step?

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.920
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
we needed r and w.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.040
AUDIENCE: Well, in the
sense that, to simplify,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.856
K equals 1/2 L?

00:34:46.856 --> 00:34:47.882
JONATHAN GRUBER: To K--

00:34:47.882 --> 00:34:48.590
oh, you're right.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.159
That's a good point.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.420
I needed r and w back here.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:50.962
You're right.

00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:52.520
That's a good point.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.310
Good point.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.970
But I still could have done this
whole thing as a function of r

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:56.239
and w if I wanted to--

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.300
if I wanted to really
screw up my math.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.180
All right?

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:00.900
OK.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.820
So now, armed with
this, let's talk

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.598
about what happens when
input prices change.

00:35:05.598 --> 00:35:07.140
We talked about with
consumer theory,

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.510
what happens when the price
of pizza and cookies change.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.900
What happens when the price
of labor and capital changes?

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.200
What does that do?

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.470
So let's talk about
changes in input prices.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:18.230
OK.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.310
Let's go to figure 6-4.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.490
And let's look at, with the
same production function,

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.990
square root of L times K-- we're
not changing our production

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:33.180
function-- we're going to
change the wage rental ratio.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:45.090
So line-- we have our initial
line, our initial wage rental

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:54.210
ratio, which is that basically
you have a wage rate,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.473
but the budget constraint,
essentially, that's flatter

00:35:57.473 --> 00:35:58.890
is our original
budget constraint.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.320
The flatter budget constraint is
our original budget constraint.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.570
That's the budget constraint
with the price of capital

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.860
of $10 and a wage of $5.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.830
And that intersects our
isoquant at point x.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:14.020
So we chose five units of labor.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.960
Now we have a new--

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.463
we chose five units of labor
and two and a half machines.

00:36:19.463 --> 00:36:20.380
That was our original.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.797
This is sort of a
messed up graph.

00:36:21.797 --> 00:36:25.560
But our original
intersection was at point x.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.270
The cost minimizing
combination, the square root

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:33.010
of 12.5 production, was to have
five workers and two and a half

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.450
machines.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.870
Now let's say the price
of workers rises to $10.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.690
The wage rate rises
to $10 an hour.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.550
So now, workers and
machines cost the same.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:49.430
What is now the optimal mix
of workers and machines?

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:53.610
Well, graphically
we know we still

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.430
want to produce the
square root of 12.5.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.660
So we want to stay tangent
to the same isoquant.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.040
So based on-- what
we're saying is,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.000
this is as if we said to
consumers, keep your utility

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.280
changed, change the price.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.442
What do we call that?

00:37:11.442 --> 00:37:12.650
Remember what we called that?

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.550
Keeping utility constant,
changing the price?

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.280
Anyone remember
what we call that?

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.900
Who said that?

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.400
All right.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.140
Raise your hand next.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:21.740
Be proud.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.442
Substitution effect.

00:37:23.442 --> 00:37:24.650
That's the substation effect.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.650
It's the same idea here.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.570
We want to know, for a
given level of production,

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.190
what happens as the price
of the inputs change?

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.060
And so we shift along
the isoquant for point x

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.920
to point y.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.860
And you'll see we
choose a mix where

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.660
we use fewer workers
and more machines.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:51.270
And just as the substitution
effect is always nonpositive,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.570
this shift as the wage
rate rises, the price

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.380
of the good, the x-axis rises.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.540
You will unambiguously use
no more, and almost certainly

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.700
less, workers.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.700
OK.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.690
And you can see
that graphically--

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.420
think about graphically,
you're looking

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.750
for the tangency between
this curve and the line.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.780
The slope of the line
just got steeper.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.150
Therefore, you must move
to the left on the curve.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.540
It's the same proof as we
used the substitution effect,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.020
where substitution effect
was always nonpositive.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.550
OK.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.960
It's the same intuition
here we use for y.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.730
A rise in the wage
rate will lead

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.960
you to hire fewer workers
and more machines.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.130
Guess what?

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.177
You just entered the
debate on the minimum wage.

00:38:35.177 --> 00:38:37.260
And if you follow the
debate in minimum wage, what

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.043
do people say?

00:38:38.043 --> 00:38:40.210
Well, if you raise the wage
you have to pay workers,

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.543
they'll be replaced by machines.

00:38:41.543 --> 00:38:43.520
That's this.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.250
This is the math-- this is
the mathematical and graphical

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.590
intuition behind the debate
on minimum wage, which we'll

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.310
get into later in the semester.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.920
But the basic idea
of that debate

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.695
is, gee, if you force firms
to pay more to workers,

00:38:54.695 --> 00:38:56.570
they're going to substitute
towards machines.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.790
That's exactly right, in theory.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.810
And practice, there's
a lot of complications.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.435
But this gives you the theory of
why people make that argument.

00:39:03.435 --> 00:39:04.160
Yeah.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.790
AUDIENCE: So in this example,
only the wage for workers

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.460
[INAUDIBLE] not the machines.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.942
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Not the machine.

00:39:11.942 --> 00:39:16.220
AUDIENCE: So why
does the isocost not

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.685
have the same y-intercept?

00:39:18.685 --> 00:39:20.060
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Ah, great point.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.880
Because here I'm drawing a new--

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.750
I am drawing the isocost that I
would use while still producing

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.870
square root of 12.5.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:32.150
So that's it's just the
substitution effect.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.917
I'm not drawing the full set
of isocosts at the new price.

00:39:35.917 --> 00:39:38.000
I'm just saying, to produce
the same amount what's

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.125
my new-- if I want to
produce the same amount, what

00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:42.960
combination do I
now have to use?

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.930
OK?

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:44.551
Yeah.

00:39:44.551 --> 00:39:46.910
AUDIENCE: The total cost
of production [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.340
JONATHAN GRUBER: The total
cost of production-- let's see.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.540
Yeah, it has to be-- no.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.040
Let's see.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.832
No, total cost doesn't
have to be the same.

00:39:53.832 --> 00:39:56.690
The total cost used to be
five workers at $5 an hour,

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.030
that's $25.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.660
So it used to be $50.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.190
Now what is it?

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.320
Now it's $70.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.505
The total cost has gone up.

00:40:04.505 --> 00:40:06.880
AUDIENCE: So it's not like
the budget constraint or the--

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.610
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.480
It's not like the
budget constraint

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.310
where your income is fixed.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.120
That's what's hard
about producer theory.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.430
Because basically,
the budget constraint

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.950
was sort of asking,
keeping your budget fixed.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.890
This is like asking, keeping
your total production fixed.

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.560
And so now you have
to pay more to get

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.420
that level of production.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.260
OK?

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.400
Good questions.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.150
OK.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.770
Now, ultimately what
does this lead to?

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.890
So that gives us our
change in input prices.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.830
Other questions about that?

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.240
Now, remember I said at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.810
we are first going
to solve for what

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.720
is the cost
minimizing combination

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.500
of inputs for a given quantity?

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.880
We derived that up there.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.110
It's half as much--

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.880
going back to our
old prices, it's

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.010
half as much capital as labor.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.680
Now we want to ask,
how does your cost

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.080
change as the quantity changes?

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.820
And we call that the
long run expansion path.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.570
The long run
expansion path, which

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:08.780
is, how do your costs
expand as you produce more?

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.580
And we see that in figure 6-5.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.680
In figure 6-5, we show
the particular case

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.720
of a linear long
run expansion path.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.520
That's what you get
in this example.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.110
It's a particular case.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:26.660
What this case says is, at
any given level of production,

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.740
the optimal mix of labor
and capital is the same.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.490
In other words, you
always want to have--

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:38.340
essentially, given
the price of labor

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.880
is half the price of
capital, you always

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.020
want to have twice as
many workers as machines.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.420
So if you want to produce
square root of 12.5,

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.540
you want five workers and
two and a half machines.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.550
If you want to produce
square root of 50,

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.110
you want 10 workers
and 5 machines.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.630
If you want to produce
square root of 112.5,

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.420
you want 15 workers
and 7 and 1/2 machines.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.180
So the long run-- given
this production function,

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.040
the long run expansion
path is linear.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.340
You always want the same
ratio of workers to machines.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.869
Yeah.

00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:08.681
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
consumer and firms,

00:42:08.681 --> 00:42:10.290
is the reason why
we don't necessarily

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.288
have a strict budget,
per se, and then isn't

00:42:13.288 --> 00:42:15.455
the idea that if we really
want increase production,

00:42:15.455 --> 00:42:17.080
we can take a loan out?

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.140
JONATHAN GRUBER: This
is what I tried to say.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.450
It's sort of-- I always say
it over here, but it's hard,

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.742
and we have to come back to it.

00:42:20.742 --> 00:42:22.840
The reason producer
theory is harder

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.960
is because we're not
given a fixed constant we

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.340
are with consumers.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.920
Consumers, we're saying, look--

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.420
you've got a resource, you've
got to constrain maximization.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.060
We haven't constrained
the maximization yet.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.350
There's another
constraint we need.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.933
They have an extra degree of
freedom relative to consumers.

00:42:39.933 --> 00:42:42.100
Now, in fact, consumers
have degree of freedom, too.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.267
When you grow up, your
parents don't give you money.

00:42:44.267 --> 00:42:45.434
You decide how much to make.

00:42:45.434 --> 00:42:47.267
So in reality, consumers--
you can do this--

00:42:47.267 --> 00:42:49.027
will have the same
degrees of freedom.

00:42:49.027 --> 00:42:50.860
But we started with the
easy consumer theory

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.603
case, where you constrict-- we
took away a degree of freedom.

00:42:53.603 --> 00:42:55.270
Now we're writing it
back, which is, you

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.740
can choose how much to produce.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.720
Like, you being able choose
your income as a consumer.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.303
That leads to long
run expansion path.

00:43:01.303 --> 00:43:02.803
Let me go on, because
I want to make

00:43:02.803 --> 00:43:04.090
sure I get through this stuff.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:04.780
OK?

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.990
Now, the long run expansion
path does not have to be linear.

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:14.090
So think about-- look
at figure 6-5b and 6-5c.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:19.870
So 6-5b is a long run expansion
path for a production function

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.680
such that capital becomes
less productive the more you

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.200
produce.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.200
I don't have the example
of production function.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.300
But when you write down
production functions which

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.180
have the feature that the
more you produce the less

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.728
productive capital
becomes, the less

00:43:33.728 --> 00:43:35.645
each additional unit
capital helps [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:35.645 --> 00:43:38.110
additional unit of workers.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.360
So you know, we could
think of this roughly as

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.600
sort of like a fast
food restaurant.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.300
That kind of-- you
know, each addition--

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.290
that basically,
there's so much stuff

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.420
to do where workers can
efficiently share tasks

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.232
and things.

00:43:50.232 --> 00:43:52.690
Each additional worker-- that
the marginal product of labor

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.670
essentially diminishes
less quickly

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:58.260
than the marginal
product of capital.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.450
On the other hand,
in figure 6-5c

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:04.440
we can have a long run expansion
path where labor becomes less

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.640
productive relative to capital.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.300
Think of it as like
heavy machinery,

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.100
where basically all workers
can do is run the machine.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.410
So that second worker--

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.215
workers don't really do much
but sit there and flip a switch.

00:44:16.215 --> 00:44:17.840
You need the worker
to flip the switch.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.632
That's all they do.

00:44:18.632 --> 00:44:21.210
So the second worker, you're
already flipping the switch.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.543
So really, adding more machines
is a more productive way

00:44:23.543 --> 00:44:25.880
to expand the output.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.570
None of these is right or wrong.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:32.100
We're just saying that the
shape of this expansion path

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.700
can basically vary
with how much--

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.830
with different
production functions.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.730
But they're all the same idea.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:47.700
Now, so basically,
that tells you--

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.980
but here's the bottom line
that we wanted to come to.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.300
That long run expansion path
is a long run cost curve.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:00.650
So ultimately, if
you want to ask,

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.250
how do my costs vary
with how much I produce,

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.370
this curve tells you.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.870
Because what it does, it says,
for every level of production

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:12.190
I'll tell you the optimal
combination of L and K.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.280
Given the price of L and K,
that will tell you the costs.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.170
And so you trace out the costs
with every level of production.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.570
This is your cost curve.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.790
This long run expansion
path tells you

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.268
what the costs are for
every level of production.

00:45:24.268 --> 00:45:25.810
And it tells you
that, because you've

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.170
made-- you're doing the
efficient level of production.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.710
That's what the long run
expansion path is telling you.

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:32.210
OK.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.530
This is hard.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.205
I'm about to make it harder.

00:45:35.205 --> 00:45:36.580
Which is, we're
now going to talk

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.715
about the relationship between
short run costs and long run

00:45:40.715 --> 00:45:41.215
costs.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:49.110
And the key insight is that
long run costs are everywhere

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:50.745
lower than short run costs.

00:45:50.745 --> 00:45:53.370
Without looking at the figure--
because the figure doesn't help

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.150
with this--

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.740
why does that make sense?

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.830
Why our long run costs--

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.430
why, if you can optimize
over the long run,

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.960
will you always
have costs that are

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:09.670
no higher, and in general lower,
than optimizing the short run?

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.310
Yeah.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] already
had the right capital.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:14.705
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Because you have

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:15.965
an extra degree of freedom.

00:46:15.965 --> 00:46:17.590
I think that's
LeChatelier's Principle.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.480
Is that right, for
the chemists among us?

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.280
That basically,
like-- essentially,

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.993
an extra degree
of freedom means,

00:46:22.993 --> 00:46:24.910
the more you can optimize
over, the better you

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:25.822
can do in optimizing.

00:46:25.822 --> 00:46:27.280
In the short run
you're constrained

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.923
by the size of the building.

00:46:28.923 --> 00:46:30.340
In the long run,
you could choose.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.470
So let's-- to see that,
let's go to figure 6-6.

00:46:34.975 --> 00:46:36.100
This is a confusing figure.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.770
So bear with me as I
walk you through it.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:39.430
OK?

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.420
Consider a firm with three
possible sizes of plants.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.070
They're going to build a plant.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.803
So the capital here
is the building.

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:48.220
And there's three
possible sizes--

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.420
small, medium, and large.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:57.390
The small plant has
the curve SRAC1.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.840
What does that curve mean?

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.840
That means that
the small plant--

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.430
I'm sorry, the small
plant is SRAC2,

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:07.160
the medium plant is SRAC2,
and the large plant has SRAC3.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.500
Compare SRAC1 to SRAC3.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.710
What this is saying is, for
small quantities of production,

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:18.780
SRAC1 lies below SRAC3.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:25.300
For small quantities production,
if you extend SRAC3 out,

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:30.960
you see at levels of
production like q1 or even q2,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.220
SRAC3 is way above SRAC1.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.590
When you go to a level
of production like q3,

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.820
SRAC1, if you extend
that dashed line out,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.310
is going to be much,
much higher than SRAC3.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.100
So the right-- and
SRAC2 is in between.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.380
So essentially, for different
levels of production

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.050
these give the different
optimal short run cost curves.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:57.550
In the long run,
you get to choose.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.220
So the long run
average cost curve

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.690
is the lower envelope of the
short run average cost curves.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:06.270
Because in the long run
you say, well, here's

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.680
my production level.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.920
I know in the long run--

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.250
so if I know I'm going
to build a lot of things,

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.170
I choose SRAC3.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.790
I choose the biggest plant.

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:17.010
If I know my production
is going to be low,

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:18.750
I choose the smallest plant.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.280
But I can optimize
in the long run

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.120
by choosing the right sized
plant for my production level.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:24.683
This is hard.

00:48:24.683 --> 00:48:26.100
And I'm almost out
of time, so let

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.040
me end with an example that
perfectly illustrates this.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.240
Tesla.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.810
Elon Musk.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.510
Everybody's favorite
guy these days.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.230
Tesla, when they came
out, had to decide

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.655
how big a plant to build--

00:48:38.655 --> 00:48:39.780
how many batteries to make.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.140
Batteries are the key
[INAUDIBLE] Teslas.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.980
And they expected to make--
to have demand for 20,000 cars

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.050
by the year 2017.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.740
So they built a
plant like SRAC1.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.960
They built a plant that
was the efficient plant

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.360
to produce 20,000 cars.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.557
The problem is, demand
was for 200,000 cars.

00:49:01.557 --> 00:49:03.640
And as a result, there's
a three-year waiting list

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.032
to get Teslas.

00:49:05.032 --> 00:49:07.240
It turned out that was not
the right size to produce.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.400
They lost money--
relative to the optimum.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.150
They made money.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.380
Musk is incredibly rich.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.005
But they didn't do what was most
efficient given the underlying

00:49:14.005 --> 00:49:14.810
demand.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:18.100
But now, Musk can re-optimize.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.900
Now he's saying, wait a second.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.580
People want way more cars.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.200
Well, producing them
at the tiny plant

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.400
was exorbitantly expensive.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.990
I had to run it
over and overtime--

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.000
pay workers overtime.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.670
To produce 200k cars
in that tiny plant

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.250
just was exorbitantly expensive.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.290
That's if you take that dashed
line and extend it way the hell

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:32.950
up.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.950
The SRAC1 extended way the
hell up, incredibly expensive.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.500
So what is Musk doing now?

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.710
Building the largest
battery plant in the world.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.870
In Nevada, he is
building a battery plant

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.200
that can produce batteries
for 500,000 cars.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.560
So he shifted from
SRAC1 to SRAC3.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.660
He's now saying
in the long run, I

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.660
can more-- if I'm going
to produce 200,000 cars,

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.020
I can do that more efficiently
with a giant battery plant.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.563
And that's what he's doing.

00:50:00.563 --> 00:50:01.480
So he's re-optimizing.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.798
Now, what if Musk is wrong?

00:50:04.798 --> 00:50:07.090
What if it turns out Teslas
suck and people are like, I

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:07.830
don't want them anymore?

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.205
Someone else-- or, you know,
Chevy finally figures it out

00:50:10.205 --> 00:50:11.888
and makes a good electric car.

00:50:11.888 --> 00:50:13.930
Then what's going to happen
is he's going to have

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.720
made a mistake in the long run.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.750
Then the third period, he'll go
back to a smaller plant again.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.450
But he always can do what's
efficient in the long run,

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.130
given the underlying demand.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.400
So Tesla is an example of this
sort of long run, short run

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:27.937
dichotomy.

00:50:27.937 --> 00:50:29.770
Anyway, it's a lot of
stuff for one lecture.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:32.350
We'll come back next time,
talk more about costs.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.730
And then we'll start
getting into competition.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.490
MICHAEL SHORT: Today we
launch into radioactive decay.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.580
And so this is kind of what
makes us, us in this field,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.540
right?

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.880
Now that you've learned
the general cu equation

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.813
we're going to look at some
very simple, specific cases,

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:37.730
and specifically all the
different things that

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.340
can come flying out of
nuclei and the orbiting

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.350
electrons around them.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.110
First I'd like to try and
develop a generalized decay

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.610
diagram.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.120
What are all the different
ways that nuclei can decay?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.030
And I had written one of these
up to show on the slides,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.118
and my one-year-old son fixed
it with a bunch of markers

00:00:57.118 --> 00:00:58.910
and crayons, so I think
we're going to have

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.065
to redo this from scratch.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.360
So let's say you had a
generalized unstable nucleus

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.560
over here.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
And we're going to start drawing
a generalized decay diagram.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
You'll see decay diagrams,
well, much like these.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.000
I've already shown
you a couple of these,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.150
like these decay
diagrams for uranium 235,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.420
soon as I clone my
screen so you can see it.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.030
There are a couple
of axes that aren't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.600
drawn on these
decay diagrams that

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.160
will help you interpret them.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.110
And the first one,
the imaginary y-axis,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.070
is in order of
increasing energy.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.000
And the second imaginary
y-axis is z, atomic number.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.090
So this will help you
determine how we read these

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.135
and how to actually write them.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:51.760
Now what are some of
the different ways

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.450
you've heard of things that
can radioactively decay,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080
or that you might have
read from the reading?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.403
Just yell them out.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:01:59.320
AUDIENCE: Alpha decay.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.445
MICHAEL SHORT: Alpha decay.

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.940
So in alpha decay,
what actually happens?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.050
Let's say that we had a parent
nucleus with atomic number

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.318
z and mass number a.

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:13.360
What does it change into?

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.880
Anyone know what an alpha
particle consists of?

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.516
Yeah.

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:24.641
AUDIENCE: A helium nucleus.

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:26.310
MICHAEL SHORT: A helium nucleus.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.780
So let's just say helium.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.260
This will be a 4 and a 2.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.480
and there's going to be
some daughter nucleus--

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.100
we don't know what--

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.700
with z minus 2 protons and
a minus 4 total nucleons.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.440
So if we were to describe
alpha decay on a decay diagram,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.850
where would we write the final
state of this alpha decayed

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.993
daughter nucleus?

00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:52.160
To the left or to the right?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.163
I know it's like 9:00 AM, but
someone just shout it out.

00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:02.580
You don't have to
raise your hand.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.260
AUDIENCE: To the left.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.860
MICHAEL SHORT: To the left.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.430
Yep.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.110
Something that's decreasing in
z and also decreasing in energy,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.870
we would draw an alpha
decay like this to the left.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.680
So let's say this
would be something more

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.490
stable with a z minus 2--

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.180
make that clear--
and an a minus 4.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.450
What are some other
ways things can decay?

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.200
I heard a whisper.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.100
AUDIENCE: Beta.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.550
MICHAEL SHORT: Beta decay.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.270
So what happens in--

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.100
usually by beta
decay, we're referring

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.050
to beta minus decay,
which would be

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.350
the emission of an
electron from the nucleus.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.050
Again, what's the
physical difference

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.690
between a beta particle
and an electron?

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.560
Nothing.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.320
What's the nomenclature
difference?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.977
The beta comes from the nucleus.

00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:51.560
Otherwise, when they
come out, they're

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.680
kind of indistinguishable.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.120
So what happens in beta decay?

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.500
Let's say we have the same
parent nucleus starting with

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.070
z,a.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.430
We know it emits an
electron with no mass.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.145
And what else?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.874
This is just a matter of
conservation of things here.

00:04:14.874 --> 00:04:16.170
AUDIENCE: Anti-neutrino.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.350
MICHAEL SHORT: There
is an anti-neutrino

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.530
which has pretty close
to no mass and no charge.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.960
And what about this
daughter nucleus?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.040
How many protons and total
nucleons would it have?

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.317
Yeah.

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:33.900
AUDIENCE: Should
have one more proton.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Should
have one more proton

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.830
and how many more
total nucleons?

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.480
The same.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.590
Yep, like that.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.870
And so how would
we draw beta decay

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.603
on this generalized diagram,
to the left or to the right?

00:04:49.603 --> 00:04:50.270
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.437
MICHAEL SHORT: To the right.

00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:52.850
It's increasing in z.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.920
I haven't defined any
scale, so let's just

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.170
say that's a change of 0.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.060
That's 1.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.660
That's 2.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.460
And that's plus 1.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.240
That's plus 2.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.050
Hopefully we won't get to today.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.240
So a beta decay
would proceed thusly.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.010
So you'd have some other
stable nucleus with c

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.373
plus 1 and mass number 8.

00:05:22.373 --> 00:05:24.790
What are some other decays you
might have heard of before?

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:28.400
AUDIENCE: Electron capture.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Electron capture.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.350
So in electron capture,
what actually happens?

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.870
Start with the same
parent nucleus.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.350
In this case, the nucleus
actually captures an electron

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.260
from one of the inner orbitals.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.590
And so that, in effect, like,
neutralizes a proton, right,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.917
in terms of charge.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.000
So what do we end up with?

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.290
Yep.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.920
So we'd have some
daughter nucleus.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.140
If it neutralizes a proton,
we'd have one fewer protons.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.515
And then how many
total nucleons?

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.030
The same.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.920
Yep.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.120
There we go.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.270
And so if we were to draw
electron capture on this map,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.230
we would have one fewer proton.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.090
So we could have some sort
of decay by electron capture.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.810
And anything else?

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.350
What other particles can
be emitted from a nucleus?

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.850
Yeah.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.030
AUDIENCE: Positrons?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.710
MICHAEL SHORT: Positrons.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.150
So let's get this list going up.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.940
So if we start off
with a parent, z and a,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.850
we know we emit
a positron, which

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.220
is the anti-matter
equivalent of an electron.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.580
So same general characteristics
except opposite charge.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.500
In this case, we'll give it
a 0 protons and 0 neutrons.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.415
And we end up with-- well,
the same daughter nucleus.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.810
So we could say that this
precedes by positron creation

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.070
or electron capture.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.340
It's the same process,
or the same ending state.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.560
But can you have positrons
in any possible decay?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.150
We actually went over this once.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.090
Anyone remember?

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.632
Yeah, so you're
shaking your head no.

00:07:31.632 --> 00:07:33.465
AUDIENCE: You have to
have a certain energy,

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:35.520
but I can't remember
what the energy is.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.187
MICHAEL SHORT: We'll
get back into that.

00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:37.980
You're right.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.840
So I'll put a little
box around this

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.030
because you have to have
a certain amount of energy

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.520
in order to create the positron.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.160
And what else?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.758
What about the easiest one?

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:50.425
What else can be
emitted from a nucleus?

00:07:53.518 --> 00:07:54.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.230
MICHAEL SHORT: I heard
a couple of things.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.410
Neutrons.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.830
So certainly if
you emit a neutron,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.390
there are some very
unstable nuclei,

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.660
like helium 5, which
exists for what,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.080
10 to the minus 26
seconds or something,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.090
that could omit a neutron.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.590
If we start off with
z and a, then we'll

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.400
start off with a
neutron and a daughter

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.183
with the same z and
a minus 1 total.

00:08:23.183 --> 00:08:25.100
So what would that look
like on a decay chain?

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.010
You don't usually see this,
but we'll draw it anyway.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.922
It would go straight
down, right?

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:37.339
So there'll be
some other nucleus.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.649
So it'd be the same
z, but an a minus 1.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.050
And it could decay
by neutron emission.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.700
Yeah, that totally happens.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.870
If you look at the
very, very right edge

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.090
of the table of nuclides--

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.370
let's go back to the
home page for that--

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.940
and look at the
super neutron rich.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.960
Like helium 10.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.210
Who's ever heard of this?

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.875
Doesn't even say, let's
say, two neutrons.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:11.250
So this is so unstable that
it just immediately spits out

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:11.850
two neutrons.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.260
So yeah, these things happen.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.620
You won't tend to see this decay
in textbooks because it only

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.080
happens for exceptionally
unstable nuclei.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.250
But yeah, that's true.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.742
It does happen.

00:09:21.742 --> 00:09:22.700
What else could happen?

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.730
Remember we've been
talking about--

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.355
yeah.

00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:28.840
AUDIENCE: Gammas?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.715
MICHAEL SHORT: Right.

00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:30.840
Could be gammas.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.030
And so I'll make one
little extra piece

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.720
here for gamma decay, which
is nothing more than a photon

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.980
emitted from the nucleus.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.960
We start off with
a parent z and a.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.373
And this becomes-- well, what?

00:09:47.373 --> 00:09:48.915
Should I even write
daughter nucleus?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.500
I see some people
shaking their heads no.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.000
Why not?

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.165
Yeah?

00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:00.040
AUDIENCE: You have
essentially the same atom.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.582
It's just one of
its electrons should

00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:04.438
be at a lower energy state.

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:05.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.770
Very close.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.340
You have the same atom, so
let's say the same parent,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.440
with the same number of
protons, the same number

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.945
of total nucleons.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.070
And I'll just correct that
to say one of its nuclei

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.630
is at a lower energy state.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.340
But otherwise everything
is completely correct.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.150
So why don't we put
a little star here

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.520
to say that that was
at an excited state?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.610
Just like electrons can be
promoted to outer shells,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.640
pick up a little bit of
energy, so can nucleons.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.470
So can protons and neutrons.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.540
And this is going to
be a subject of, well,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.730
great discussion in 22.02.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.570
For now all you have to know is
that nucleons, like electrons,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.730
can occupy higher energy states.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.710
And when they fall down
to lower energy states,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:49.150
they can release that energy
in the form of a gamma ray.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.010
So you could also
have, let's say,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:56.470
squiggly line gamma decay
to something stable.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.685
And so this right here would be
the generalized decay diagram.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.090
Anyone ever heard
of one isotope that

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.700
undergoes all these
possible decay mechanisms?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.760
Glad no one's saying anything,
because neither have I.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.040
There's one that comes close.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.477
Actually, if you look at--

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.310
no, that's not this
part I want to show you.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.700
I want to show you the big one.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.880
If you look at potassium
40, the nuclide we probably

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.310
talked about the most
so far, it covers

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.250
most of the space of this
generalized decay diagram.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.550
And there was a question
that came through--

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.170
at least, I think for
non-anonymous email,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.190
what is it that makes these
even, even versus odd,

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.460
odd nuclei less or more stable?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.660
Anytime you have an odd,
odd nucleus, both the number

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.400
of protons and the
number of neutrons,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.340
these nuclear shells
are not fully occupied

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.430
and they're not that stable
compared to an even, even

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.182
nucleus that has an even number
of z and an even number of n.

00:11:53.182 --> 00:11:54.890
Just kind of like
electrons, these things

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.600
tend to travel in pairs.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.590
And not fully occupied energy
levels will be left stable.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.090
Potassium 40 happens to be one
of those odd, odd nuclei that

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.550
is relatively unstable.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.660
And it can go either way.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.930
Either you can lose a proton
or you can gain a proton

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.950
by competing mechanisms
like positron or electron

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.110
capture or beta emission.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.020
So this one I like a
lot because it gives you

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.720
almost every possible
decay with the exception

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.750
of alpha decay and
spontaneous neutron emission.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.260
It's not that unstable.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.250
Then the only one really missing
from here, I found what I think

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.220
is the simplest decay
diagram ever, dysprosium-151.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.930
There's only one thing it can do
is it can decay by alpha decay

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.490
to its ground state.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.830
I want to point out a few of
the features of these decay

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.830
diagrams so you know
what to look for.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.630
Up here is the parent nucleus.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.940
Down there is the
daughter nucleus.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.930
And these energies
are not absolute.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.060
They're relative to the ground
state of whatever the daughter

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.620
nucleus is.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.030
So simple example helps show
you that gadolinium-147 doesn't

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.950
have a binding energy of 0.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.760
This is relative to the ground
state of gadolinium-147.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.760
And that will tell you that
the Q value for this reaction

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.720
is 4.1796 MeV.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.470
These things are usually listed
in MeV unless said otherwise.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.010
You also might notice a pattern
that most alpha particles

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.340
tend to come out
around 4 MeV or larger.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.130
The answer to why is going
to be given in 22.02.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.000
Yep.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.975
AUDIENCE: Where do these
percentages come from?

00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:35.350
MICHAEL SHORT: These percentages
tell you the probability

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.720
that each decay will happen.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.512
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:13:37.512 --> 00:13:39.573
Like how do we derive--

00:13:39.573 --> 00:13:40.615
how do we find those out?

00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:42.115
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah,
these are usually

00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:44.170
measured because
it can be-- let's

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.510
say things get quantum
and difficult in terms

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.650
of calculating these.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.540
And our knowledge
of wave functions

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.380
of, well, higher and
higher a or z nuclei

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.810
gets a little more tenuous.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.310
So a lot of these
would be measured.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.940
You can look at the number of
alpha particles of each energy

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.750
that you observe, and then you
get the average probabilities.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.870
For this one, it's simple.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.420
There's 100%
probability that this

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.250
is the only thing that exists.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.500
The other things to
note, the half life

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.290
will be given up here, in
this case, at 17.9 minutes.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.502
So relatively long half
life compared to helium 5.

00:14:18.502 --> 00:14:20.210
And we'll be going
over what half life is

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.210
and what they are on Friday.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.150
And then the last thing
are the spin states

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.860
of the initial and
final nuclei, which

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.670
we will not cover in this class,
but you will cover in 22.02.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.290
So don't worry about
those now, but do

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.990
know that when you need
to go find the spin

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.240
states of the initial
and final nuclei

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.880
to see if certain
transitions are allowed,

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.440
this is where
you're going to go.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.350
Any questions on what you see
here on how to read these decay

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.850
diagrams?

00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:49.510
Cool.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.050
OK.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.510
Then let's move on to the
simplest of them, which,

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.763
in the table, can look
the most complicated.

00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:57.680
So here you can see that
there's a whole bunch

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.950
of different probabilities for
different alpha decay nuclei.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.200
This is one of those more
complex examples where

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.600
the easiest thing to
do is just measure,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.940
see how many alphas
you get at each energy,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.430
and this will give you the
approximate probabilities

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.987
that each decay happens.

00:15:11.987 --> 00:15:13.820
And you'll notice here
that the final energy

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.140
states for each of these
alphas is not necessarily 0.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.720
This will tell you what they
are relative to the ground state

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.110
of, in this case, thorium 231.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.130
So you can emit an alpha
from any combination

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.530
of nuclear shell levels
inside this nucleus.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.410
And you might end up
with a new daughter

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.648
nucleus whose protons or
neutrons are in excited states.

00:15:37.648 --> 00:15:39.440
And the way you remove
those excited states

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.760
is gamma decay, like
we talked about here.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.670
So a lot of alpha
decays are immediately

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.600
followed by a chain
of gamma decays,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.560
or what we call ITs, or
isometric transitions.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.245
So you'll see a couple
bits of notation.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.700
For example, gamma
decay, you may hear

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.333
it called isomeric transition.

00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:05.750
We'll try to give them all so
that in the various readings

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.531
you have, you know what's what.

00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:11.730
So notice here, you can
have, with a probability

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.030
so small that they
didn't bother to draw it,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.630
an alpha decay 2.634 MeV.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.210
And then any series
of gammas from, let's

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.460
say, from this
state to that state,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.610
and then from this
state to one of those

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.130
or one of those, and then
another one down there.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.630
So an alpha decay
may be followed

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.860
by a whole bunch of gamma
transitions, or as few as none.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.990
If you want to see what
the alpha energies are,

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.730
well, let's head to
the table of nuclides

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:46.800
and look at uranium 235.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.210
So if we look up U 235,
you can see that it alpha

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.375
decays to thorium 231.

00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:55.000
And I'll show you
the part of the table

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.150
that I didn't show you in
the slides, which is then

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.140
you've got a table of
alpha decay energies

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.410
as well as relative intensities
and what's called a hindrance.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.990
This stuff right here
comes from the fact

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.450
that different
alpha decay energies

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.150
can happen with
different probabilities

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.810
at different times.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.589
So the half life of a
particular alpha decay

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.819
can be slightly different.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.210
And this is another one of
those really kooky things, where

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.079
certain energy alpha transitions
will happen a little more often

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.910
initially then finally.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.700
But we don't have to
worry about that yet.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.428
I just want you to know that's
why the hindrance is there.

00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:33.970
And so you can look,
from this table,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.600
what's the probability that each
of these alphas will come out.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.070
And there's going to be
some uncertainty associated

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.570
with these.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.737
This is going to usually
be some sort of measurement

00:17:42.737 --> 00:17:44.010
uncertainty.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.110
Then you might
also ask, why is it

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.630
that the highest
energy alpha ray

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:55.210
is not the same
energy as the Q value?

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.920
So for this, it's a greatly
simplified application

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.272
of the Q equation that
we learned last time.

00:18:03.272 --> 00:18:05.230
So for here, what are
the two equations that we

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.440
need to conserve if we have
a system consisting of--

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.535
we have our initial nuclei
going into our final nuclei.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.170
And they go off in equal
and opposite directions.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:26.630
If it's alpha decay, then we
have no little initial nucleus.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.650
We just had a large
initial nucleus at rest.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.070
And afterwards, you've got
a small final nucleus, which

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.580
we know is the alpha particle,
and a large final nucleus,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.620
which we'll call the
daughter product.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.892
And let's say this
is the parent.

00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:46.100
It's a much, much simpler
system than the general one

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.600
we analyzed last week.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.100
So what are the
equations that we'll

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.592
use to serve to find
out what's the energy

00:18:51.592 --> 00:18:52.550
of this alpha particle?

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:57.790
Anyone?

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.990
Same three answers as always.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.798
Yep.

00:19:01.798 --> 00:19:03.340
AUDIENCE: Mass,
energy, and momentum.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.132
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:19:04.132 --> 00:19:07.645
Mass, energy, and momentum.

00:19:11.043 --> 00:19:13.210
I'm going to lump these two
together because they're

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.780
kind of the same thing.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.420
So let's just go with
energy and momentum.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.342
So what is the initial
kinetic energy, or let's say,

00:19:21.342 --> 00:19:23.050
the initial kinetic
energy of this parent

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.297
nucleus we can assume to be 0.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:27.380
What about the final kinetic
energy of the system?

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:32.450
Well, there's only
two particles.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.560
There's going to be some kinetic
energy of the alpha particle

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.910
plus the recoil kinetic energy
because if the alpha goes

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.760
in one direction, the
daughter nucleus has to go off

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.020
in the other direction.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.090
And the total energy
comes out to Q.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.700
This Q value you can get
by conserving mass, where

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:58.620
we can say that the
mass of the parent

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.640
has to equal the
mass of the alpha

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.870
plus the mass of
the daughter plus Q.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.570
So that's where we can get Q
if we don't know it already.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.668
Luckily, we know it already.

00:20:14.668 --> 00:20:15.710
So there we've used mass.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.180
There we've used energy.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.080
And now what are the momenta
of the initial and final states

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.740
here?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.010
Anyone?

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.760
Just shout it out.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.956
What's the initial momentum
of the parent nucleus?

00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:25.690
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.245
MICHAEL SHORT: 0 equals--

00:20:28.245 --> 00:20:29.620
what's the momentum
of the alpha?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.340
Anyone remember that
trick if we want to say p

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.110
equals mv equals what
more convenient form

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.430
that contains the energy?

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.540
Square root of 2 mt.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.180
So let's go with that.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.660
So there'll be the
square root of 2 mass

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.300
of the alpha, kinetic
energy of the alpha,

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.600
minus the square root
of 2 times the mass

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.020
of the daughter times the
kinetic energy of the daughter

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.840
because these have to have
equal and opposite momenta.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.810
So all we have to do is
move that one over here.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.140
This makes that equation easy.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.960
Everything's got a
square root of 2.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.235
We can square both sides.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.400
And we end up with a
pretty simple relation,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.560
mass of the alpha times the
kinetic energy of the alpha

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.230
is the mass of the daughter
times the kinetic energy

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.710
of the daughter.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.930
We don't usually care
about the kinetic energy

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.045
of the recoil nucleus
or the daughter

00:21:40.045 --> 00:21:41.920
because the range is so
small that we usually

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.030
don't get to measure it.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.740
But we are trying
to measure what

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.650
are the actual alpha
particle energies so

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:55.270
that we can reconstruct
this table down here.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.700
So we can take our energy
conservation equation

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.420
and rearrange it to isolate
td, the kinetic energy

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:08.360
of the daughter, and say
td equals Q minus t alpha.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.730
Substitute that in here.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.900
And let's rewrite
what we've got.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.890
Mass of the alpha, t alpha,
equals mass of the daughter

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.660
times Q minus t alpha.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:32.310
If we multiply each term in here
by md, we get mdQ minus md t

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.020
alpha.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.960
Then we can take all of
the t alphas on one side.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.940
So we'll just add md
t alpha to each side.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.710
So we have m alpha
t alpha plus md t

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:55.870
alpha equals md Q. We can
factor out the t alpha here.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.480
And then we can divide each
side by m alpha plus m daughter.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.630
Cancel out the ma plus md.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.830
And there we have the answer.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.060
The kinetic energy
of the alpha is just

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.600
the q value times the
ratio of the daughter

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.820
mass to the total mass.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.520
This should look
awfully familiar.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.700
When we did this in the frame
of neutron elastic scattering

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.490
or any other reaction,
we had the same equation

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.410
with just different notation.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.780
So do you guys
recognize this firm,

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:44.780
where we had t3 equals Q
times m4 over m3 plus m4.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.560
It's the exact same result,
just different notation.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.320
Last time we did it in the
most complex way possible.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.080
This time we started off with
the simplest possible equations

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.430
for alpha decay.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.645
In the end it's the
same Q equation.

00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:00.020
We just didn't bother with
all the other terms and angles

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.270
and things that we don't need.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.660
So is everyone clear
where this came from?

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.530
Cool.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.570
And that's why
you're never going

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.000
to see an alpha
particle that's got

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.100
the same energy as the
initial minus the final energy

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.860
because the recoil nucleus,
or the daughter nucleus,

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.200
takes away some of
that kinetic energy

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.140
in order to conserve the
momentum of the system that

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.983
was initially at rest.

00:24:28.983 --> 00:24:30.400
Another way to say
this, for those

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.900
who like center of
mass coordinates,

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.420
is the center of
mass of this system

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.340
was just the parent nucleus.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.870
It was at rest.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.570
The center of mass of the final
system has to remain at rest

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.370
to conserve momentum.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.890
But again, I won't go
much into center of mass

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.230
because I find it a
little unintuitive.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.240
I'll stick with a laboratory
frame of reference.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.650
So any questions
before I move on?

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.170
Alpha, I think, is the simplest
case of radioactive decay.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:01.060
And I think now you know all
you need to know about it.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.230
Yes.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.390
AUDIENCE: So why do you
get so many different types

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.300
if we just calculated it?

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.770
Like mb, in mass
[INAUDIBLE] change?

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Not ma and md.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.490
But ta and td would change.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:18.990
Yep.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.750
So in this case, for
different alpha decays,

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.760
they'll have different Q values.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.730
So the Q value of, let's
say, this top alpha decay

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:32.430
is this energy here,
4.676 MeV minus 0.634.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:38.245
So use a different Q and you'll
get different ta's and td's.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:38.870
So don't worry.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.960
You'll get chances to try
out these calculations

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.460
on the homework,
where I'll actually

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.990
ask you to calculate some
of these from this equation,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.990
make sure you get the
same values as the table.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.060
Any other questions on alpha
decay before moving on to beta?

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.540
Just going in order
of the Greek alphabet.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.640
So beta decay is a
kind of funny one.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.940
You don't tend to get
a beta particle out

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.520
at the energy of this Q value.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.650
You actually end up
getting a spectrum.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:15.020
And this measured spectrum of
different beta kinetic energies

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.940
is what led to the
thoughts that there

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.360
must be something else carrying
away some of that extra mass

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.880
or some of that extra energy.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.710
I say that like it's the same
thing because it totally is.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.750
And this is what
led to the thinking

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.810
that there's got to be some
other very difficult to detect

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.320
particle.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.480
So the theorists
here we're saying,

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.520
if we know the initial and
final energies from beta decay,

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.430
and we know that we get a
spectrum of different beta

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.680
energies and the
probability of finding

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.640
a beta particle at energy
Q drops to, like, 0,

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.140
you'll almost never see it.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.300
There's got to be something
else carrying away the energy.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.370
So this idea of the
neutrino, or in this case,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.340
the anti-neutrino, was
proposed a long time

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.590
before it was confirmed.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.575
And finally we know why.

00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:01.700
And one of the questions
I want you to think about,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.330
because it might be on an
exam in exactly two weeks,

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.560
is if this is the relative
number of electrons

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.270
from beta decay as a
function of energy,

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.660
what does the number of
anti-neutrinos versus energy

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.328
look like in order to maintain
conservation of energy?

00:27:18.328 --> 00:27:20.370
So it's something I want
you guys to think about,

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.787
but I'm not going
to tell you what

00:27:21.787 --> 00:27:24.900
it is until the
solutions for an exam.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.180
In the meantime,
another thing to note

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.670
is that these beta
decays can also

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.410
be followed by any number
of gamma transitions.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.170
I've given you a simple one.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.020
If you want to look up simple
ones to test your knowledge,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.880
go with the light elements.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.530
They don't have
that many nucleons

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.110
and they won't have
that many transitions.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.690
For example, if we pick
a beta decay nucleus,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.150
something simple.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.430
Let's go with lithium,
which typically has--

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.920
the stable isotopes are
lithium 6 or lithium 7.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.470
So do you think
that higher or lower

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.608
mass number lithium will
tend to go by beta decay

00:28:03.608 --> 00:28:05.275
based on this generalized
decay diagram?

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.920
It's what?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:13.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Lower.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.175
Lower proton number?

00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:16.300
Well, we've got to stick
with the number of protons

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.370
because we need
to remain lithium.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.120
So in other words, do
you expect lithium 4

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.880
and lithium 5 or lithium 8 and
lithium 9 to go by beta decay?

00:28:30.577 --> 00:28:31.660
AUDIENCE: The higher ones.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.400
MICHAEL SHORT: The higher ones.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.995
OK.

00:28:32.995 --> 00:28:34.620
If you guys remember
the mass parabolas

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.720
from a couple of weeks
ago, we delineated

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.920
where you'd expect
beta decay in order

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.808
to increase the proton number.

00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:47.850
So if you've got too many
neutrons and not enough

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.690
protons, chances are beta decay
will help equalize you out.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.470
So as a guess--

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.550
I haven't even
tried this at home.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.057
Let's see.

00:28:54.057 --> 00:28:55.640
Let's see what happens
with lithium 8.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.860
Oh, look at that.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.740
Beta decay.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.020
It can also decay by
beta plus 2 alpha,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:05.330
which is another word for
the nucleus just blows apart.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.570
It's interesting, too, if you
read Chadwick's paper again,

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.350
the way he described a
beryllium nucleus is consisting

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.010
of a neutron plus
two alpha particles.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.630
Interesting, huh?

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.100
Lithium 9 could decay
by--or let's say lithium 8.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.380
What do we have?

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.510
Beta plus 2 alpha.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.240
Yeah.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.490
So Chadwick
described any nucleus

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.400
as consisting of these
elementary-ish particles

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.780
that you could measure.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.150
And in this case, you kind
of see a physical example.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.830
When this nucleus
blows apart, it just

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.780
becomes two alphas in a beta.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.790
Interesting.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.340
But let's look at the
beta decay to beryllium 8.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.040
Pretty simple.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.970
You may ask why can't you
have beta decay directly

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.530
from the highest energy to
the ground state energy?

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.700
That is a 22.02 question
that I'll mention.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.410
There are allowed and unaligned
transitions between spins

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.650
and energy states.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:01.060
So if you're wondering why
isn't every line drawn,

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.800
in the case of really
complex nuclei,

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.350
there aren't enough pixels
on the screen sometimes.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.690
But for the simple
nuclei, there are actually

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.580
rules of selection
to decide when

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.158
you can make this transition.

00:30:11.158 --> 00:30:12.700
But a lot of beta
decays will usually

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.370
be something like a beta
decay followed by a gamma.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.160
So let's see a couple
of well-known examples.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.450
For example, carbon-14.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.180
This is the basis behind
carbon dating, one

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.907
of those rare instances when
you have a beta decay directly

00:30:28.907 --> 00:30:29.740
to the ground state.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.930
It's about as simple as it gets.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.890
And because the half
life is 5,730 years,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.110
it's really useful
for dating when

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.270
did an organism or
piece of material

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:44.320
die on the timescale of, let's
say, tens to tens of thousands

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.550
of years.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.310
Once you've gone
past a few half lives

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.695
and there's very
little carbon-14 left,

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:51.070
there aren't a
lot of decays left

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.260
and your counting
statistics get crappy,

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.960
and it gets harder and
harder to carbon date things.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.200
The basis behind this is that
all living organisms that

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.770
are intaking and exhaling
carbon by some means

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.430
remain in isotopic equilibrium
with the carbon surrounding

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.330
them.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.390
And while most carbon is
CO2, and food and whatever

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.490
is carbon-12,
you're going to have

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.880
a little bit of
carbon-14 production

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.110
from the upper atmosphere.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.850
This is usually a
cosmic ray phenomenon,

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.880
which we'll get into when
we get into cosmic rays.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.150
The moment you die you
stop intaking carbon,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.270
and the little bit of carbon-14
in the cloth and the food

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.970
and your body, whatever,
starts to decay naturally

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.840
with a very regular decay curve.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.257
And so this is the whole
basis behind carbon dating.

00:31:36.257 --> 00:31:37.840
And in the next
p-set, you'll actually

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.560
see how this was used to
debunk the Shroud of Turin,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.320
or the supposed burial
cloth of Jesus of Nazareth,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.250
because the carbon dating
data just didn't check out.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.920
As much as people really wanted
to feel like we found it, no.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.060
Science.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.900
That's the answer.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.970
No.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.640
Another well-known one
we've talked about before

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.950
is molybdenum 99 decaying to
technetium 99 meta stable.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.660
Notice how here,
any number of beta

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.890
decays and any cascade of
very fast gamma transitions,

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.738
they almost all end right
here at this state of about--

00:32:13.738 --> 00:32:16.030
let's see, there's two numbers
written over each other.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.230
But it's about 140
keV or 0.14 MeV.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.720
This transition from this
state to the ground state

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.390
is a slow transition.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.890
So you can actually
build up technitum 99

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.870
in what's called
series decay, which

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.790
we're going to cover on Friday.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:34.780
And then you can use
these 140 KeV gamma

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.878
rays to do medical imaging.

00:32:36.878 --> 00:32:38.920
So when you get a medical
imaging procedure done,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.830
chances are this
is how it's done.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:46.720
You get moly 99 out of a
reactor or an accelerator,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.420
chemically isolate
the technetium 99 meta

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.970
stable, which lasts on
the order of six days

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.180
or so, very quickly get
it to someone, inject it,

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.110
and image where do
the gamma rays go,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.840
or where do the
gamma rays come from?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.950
One last notable one is
responsible for a lot of, well,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.320
problems when folks
go urban exploring

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.480
in old dentist's offices.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.040
Nowadays they have
electrostatic x-ray machines

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.030
at dentist's offices.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.460
But back in the day, you
could get a little button

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.420
of cobalt 60, which would emit
two very characteristic gamma

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.460
rays in addition
to its beta decays.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.020
So normally what happens
is cobalt 60 decays quickly

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.760
to an excited
state and gives off

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.400
two gamma rays in
succession, which

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.490
would be used for imaging.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.073
Problem is that's
the a cobalt source.

00:33:36.073 --> 00:33:38.323
And if you don't know what
it is, and you're like, oh,

00:33:38.323 --> 00:33:41.660
cool, what's this blue thing, I
think I'll put it in my pocket

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.560
and keep it--

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.860
that has been responsible
for some injuries

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.942
from some folks that
didn't know any better.

00:33:48.942 --> 00:33:50.650
And then how do you
detect the neutrinos?

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.810
We talked about the theoretical
reason why they exist.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.660
Let's actually see
how they're measured.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.790
There is a hollowed
out salt mine

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.270
of some sort called
Kamiokande in Japan.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.680
It's a humongous hole in the
ground filled with water,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.820
for a reason, and lined
with tens of thousands

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.219
of highly sensitive photo
tubes that can pick up

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.500
tiny, tiny amounts of light.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.750
The reason for this
is because neutrinos,

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.030
as you saw in problem
set 1, are always

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.060
traveling near the speed
of light in a vacuum.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.020
So if the speed of
light in a vacuum,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:31.989
let's call that 1, and the
velocity of the neutrino--

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:33.379
wasn't it something like 9.

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:36.250
999c or something like that?

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:37.880
It was pretty high.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.770
The speed of light and
water is significantly less

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.989
than the speed of
light in a vacuum.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.780
When you have a material or
a particle that goes faster

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.693
than the speed of light in the
medium that it's traveling in,

00:34:50.693 --> 00:34:52.110
then you can produce
what's called

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.710
Cherenkov radiation,
which I think

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.489
I've mentioned once before.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.850
It's kind of like a
sonic boom in that you

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.450
get a conical shockwave
of energy radiated

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.000
from that particle that tells
you which direction it's

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.990
coming from.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.300
But instead of a sound
wave, you get light.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.920
And this whole
detector is designed

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.670
to look at the ellipses of
Cherenkov radiation released

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.920
by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.550
So what happens is
if a neutrino happens

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.180
to interact with the water here,
it produces Cherenkov radiation

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.460
lighting up a ring
of these detectors

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.320
so you can tell
it's energy and you

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.460
can tell where it came from.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.520
So if you, let's
say, can correlate

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.930
a supernova or some sort
of crazy galactic whatever

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.510
with a slight
burst of neutrinos,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.290
then you've got a pretty
significant astronomical event.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.270
It also led to my
favorite BBC headline

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:47.760
ever, "Particle physics
telescope explodes."

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.720
You'd see this on, like,
Fox News or something.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.450
No, this was the BBC.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.060
What happened here is
one of these 30,000

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.580
or so tubes was
slightly defective,

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.570
couldn't hold the
pressure, and it burst.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.220
And the resulting
sound shock wave

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.640
from one photo tube bursting
blew up about 11,000 of them.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.940
So yeah, the particle physics
telescope kind of did explode.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.480
They did rebuild it
and it's still going.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.690
It was an expensive repair
because all 11,300 something

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.830
tubes had to be rebuilt.
And if you notice,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.270
there's a guy on a boat there.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.500
How do you install them?

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.400
Well, you float
on a boat quietly,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.060
and put the photo tubes in,
and raise the water level,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.670
and float to another
part of the detector

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.820
quietly, and continue
installing the photo tubes

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.860
until you're done.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:38.807 --> 00:36:39.640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.070
You don't.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.000
Yeah.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.790
Don't sneeze.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:44.480
So yeah.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.600
Favorite BBC headline ever.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.140
Thanks again, science.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.750
For positron decay--

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.560
OK, we've got about
10 minutes left--

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.010
for positron decay,
this is the energy

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.760
that you need in order
to make a positron.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.840
It is approximately exactly
double the [INAUDIBLE] rest

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.360
mass of an electron.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.010
And the question usually
comes up, well, a positron

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.370
has a rest mass
energy of 0.511 MeV.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.660
Why do you need double
that to make the positron?

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.910
Because in order to conserve
the charge of the system,

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.180
you have to shed an
orbital electron.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.540
So the system has got to be
able to lose two electrons

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.160
in the process, one
positively charged

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.870
and one negatively charged.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.740
And so that's why the
Q for positron decay

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.240
is just going to be--

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.640
remember, this symbol's
the excess mass here,

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.310
excess mass of the parent minus
excess mass of the daughter

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.570
minus 2 times the rest mass
of the electron squared.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:41.990
To refresh your memories a
bit, find some empty space.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.420
The excess mass is
nothing more than the mass

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.730
minus the horrible
approximation of the mass.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.040
So the excess mass and the
real mass are directly related.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.430
And these are things
that you can look up.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.260
Just to remind you
guys that excess mass

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.390
and mass and binding
energy and kinetic energy

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.500
are all related, again,
by the Q equation.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.792
It's probably the last time
I'll say it because I think

00:38:03.792 --> 00:38:07.290
that's about 100, by my count.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.810
Positrons can be used for
some pretty awesome things.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.000
And in the last
five minutes or so,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.190
I want to show you some
work done by Professor Brian

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.360
Wirth at the University
of Tennessee,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.010
Knoxville on positron
annihilation spectroscopy,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.500
using anti-matter
to probe matter

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.030
and find out what
sort of defects exist.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.970
And as a nuclear
material scientist,

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.270
I'd be, well, terrible
if I didn't inject

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.400
a little bit of
materials and how

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.040
we use nuclear stuff in 22.01
in order to probe that thing.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.140
So the way that positron
annihilation spectroscopy works

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.630
is that, well, matter's
mostly empty space.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.570
And then in a regular
crystal lattice,

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:52.000
where the atoms are arranged
in a very regular array,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.110
let's say these atoms have
their orbital electrons.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.950
The empty space between
is also arranged

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.810
in a very regular array.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.440
And positrons annihilate
with electrons to produce--

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.090
well, we'll find
out in a second.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.070
But where in matter
would they want to live,

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.420
or where would they last longer?

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.580
Not near an atom, but
near the space in between.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.930
So you can map out the
empty spaces in matter

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.900
in a regular crystal and
calculate an average positron

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:20.920
lifetime.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.600
If you were to fire a
positron into this matter,

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.270
how long would it
sit and bounce around

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.090
before colliding
with an electron

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.840
and releasing that
extra rest mass energy?

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.930
It turns out if you have
crystalline defects,

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:39.810
the positrons tend to
last a little longer.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.950
There's a little
more empty space,

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.820
which is to say there are
more places with a slightly

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.920
less probability of
finding an electron.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.410
And so they last longer.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.778
And you can measure the
lifetime of positrons

00:39:52.778 --> 00:39:55.320
before they enter the material,
and then how long before they

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.800
produce their characteristic
destruction gamma rays.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.020
So if you think about it,
you have a positron coming in

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:10.800
with a rest mass 0.511 MeV.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.100
And it collides with an electron
from some orbital nucleus that

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.320
has the same rest mass.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.080
The positron and the electron
annihilate sending off

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.300
gamma rays in opposite
directions, where

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:31.062
the energy of this gamma
is same thing, 0.511 MV.

00:40:31.062 --> 00:40:32.520
So you can tell
when a positron was

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.450
destroyed because you instantly
get 1/2 a MeV gamma ray.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.420
Or actually, you get
two 1/2 MeV gamma rays.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.560
Then the question is, how
do you tell its lifetime?

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.920
Let's go back to something
that I didn't quite point out,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.310
but I want to show you
now, is this positron decay

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:54.480
is immediately followed
by a 1.27 MeV gamma

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.690
ray, which in PAS, or Positron
Annihilation Spectroscopy,

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.540
we call this the
birth gamma ray.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:05.790
This gamma ray is emitted the
instant this nucleus is born.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.727
And the positron takes a little
bit of time to get destroyed.

00:41:09.727 --> 00:41:11.310
So you actually look
at the difference

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:20.080
in time between sensing the 1.27
MeV gamma ray and the 0.511 MeV

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.952
annihilation photons.

00:41:21.952 --> 00:41:23.410
And that is measured
in, let's say,

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.300
hundreds of pico
seconds with resolution

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.310
of around 5 picoseconds.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:31.000
And you can then tell, from the
lifetime and how many survive,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.595
what sort of atomic defects
might exist in the material.

00:41:35.595 --> 00:41:37.720
So if you want to count
the number of missing atoms

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.840
or vacancies in
a material, which

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.270
is extremely important to those
of us in radiation damage,

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:47.300
you can do so with positron
annihilation spectroscopy.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.550
So I think I wanted to show
you a little bit about how

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.270
this works.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:55.050
You start off by making a
radioactive salt sandwich.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.110
You take some sodium
chloride, specifically

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:02.820
of the isotope sodium 22,
which is giving off positrons

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.900
all the time.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.230
And you sandwich that
radioactive jelly

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.320
between the two slices of bread,
better known as your sample.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.060
That way you catch
every positron

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.710
that gets out so you don't
lose half of them to one side.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.320
You've got two detectors
on either side waiting.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.228
So there's some probability
that the photons emitted

00:42:22.228 --> 00:42:24.270
are going to go in the
direction of the detector.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.360
So you miss most of the
signal, but so what?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.100
Whenever you actually sense
a 1.27 MeV gamma ray followed

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.580
by two 511 KeVs
here, then you know

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.860
you've had a positron
annihilation event,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.160
and you can actually count
the time between when

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.390
those things happened.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.890
And you can see the
number of counts

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.930
and get the average
positron lifetime

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.170
from finding out how many
counts you get every five pico

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.280
seconds, for example.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.610
There's something to note
about these counting spectra.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.610
Anybody know why they're
so smooth up here

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:02.540
and then they're so
delineated down here?

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.998
Anyone have an idea?

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.550
You're going to see this a lot
in 22.09, when you actually

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.460
count theta particles or alpha
particles and your counting

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.650
statistics get a
little crappier.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.930
This is a log scale of
counts, or in this case,

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.780
counts per five pico seconds.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.090
10 to the 0's better known as 1.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.120
So you're looking at one
count or two or three.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.690
You're looking at
the discrete event.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.630
You can't have one
and 1/2 counts.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.910
So you're going to
see this kind of thing

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.700
quite a lot when you're trying
to count very rare events.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.640
And if you're down in
the weeds like this,

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.070
let's just say your
statistics aren't that good.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.890
But since this is a logarithmic
scale, 10 to the 4th

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.780
is better known
as 10,000, that's

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.910
enough to get good
statistics and fit

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:49.600
a nice curve to this
positron lifetime thing.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.000
This is what one of them
actually looks like.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.058
And you can kind of tell.

00:43:55.058 --> 00:43:57.350
Inside there is where all
the positrons are coming out.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.410
So that's probably
lead shielding.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.660
Here's two detectors
on either side.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.960
And here's another detector
to detect that 1.27 MeV birth

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.813
gamma ray.

00:44:06.813 --> 00:44:08.730
So if you get those three
events happening all

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.480
at the right time, you've
got a positive event

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.272
that you can count.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.920
And last thing I'll mention
is you can actually use this,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.380
like I said, to gut not just
the number of vacancies,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.050
but the number of
different size defects.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.970
You might have two or
three missing atoms next

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:28.140
to each other, which will have
different positron lifetimes.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.780
And you can actually count
the number of each of these

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:35.322
to get the diameter or the
size of these atomic defects.

00:44:35.322 --> 00:44:37.030
And this is one of
the ways of confirming

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.630
our models of radiation damage,
which is, like, all I do.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.785
That's half of our group.

00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:44.160
If you want to
read anything more

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.800
about positron
annihilation spectroscopy,

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.665
all the stuff in
these slides were

00:44:48.665 --> 00:44:50.790
from these references,
which you can look up easily

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.440
on the MIT libraries.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.750
We have access to everything
because that's MIT.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.705
We just buy everything there is.

00:44:56.705 --> 00:44:58.080
So I'd encourage
you to look here

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.750
if you want to see more
details on how this works

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.450
and why it works.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:06.140
So because it's exactly
five of five of,

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.930
I want to open it up to any
questions on alpha decay,

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:12.065
beta decay, positron decay,
or the decay diagrams

00:45:12.065 --> 00:45:13.190
that we've developed today.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.360
Yes.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.540
AUDIENCE: What is the most
dangerous kind of decay?

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.457
MICHAEL SHORT: What is
the most dangerous kind

00:45:23.457 --> 00:45:25.320
of decay to be exposed to?

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.640
So in this case, you'd want to
say the energy of the particle

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.440
is held constant, and the
number of those particles

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.150
is held constant.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.643
And actually, we're going
to answer this question

00:45:35.643 --> 00:45:37.560
when we get to medical
and biological effects.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.163
But let's do a little
flash word now.

00:45:39.163 --> 00:45:41.580
Let's assume, if you want to
see which one of these decays

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.610
is most dangerous, we'll
have to say constant--

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:54.010
constant-- energy of decay,
constant activity, and what

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.850
else can we hold constant?

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.070
Well, constant you.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.360
Let's say the same number of
particles end up hitting you.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:07.080
That depends on whether they're
inside or outside your body.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.680
If you were to ingest
material, then alphas

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.200
would be your worst
because alpha particles

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.650
are massive and
charged nuclei, which

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.630
means they interact very
strongly with matter

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:19.210
around them.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.182
So if you ingest
them and they end up

00:46:21.182 --> 00:46:23.640
incorporating into your cells,
where they can just get next

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.580
to DNA, they can
just blast it apart.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:29.460
However, an alpha source
of equal strength held

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.920
in your hand would do nothing.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.142
The dead skin cells are enough
to stop alpha particles.

00:46:35.142 --> 00:46:36.600
And we're going to
find out exactly

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.850
why when we look at
the range and stopping

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.540
power of different
particles and matter.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.950
From the outside, alphas won't
really get through your skin.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.110
Betas might get through a little
bit of your skin, but not much.

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.660
Gamma rays will mostly
go right through you.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.650
It's neutrons that
are the real killers.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:58.190
Those neutrons are
heavy but uncharged.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.380
So they interact
kind of strongly.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.590
When they do hit,
they pack a wallop

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.130
and they do a lot of damage.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.900
And they're mean
free path, and you is

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.920
on the order of 10 centimeters.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.030
So a neutron source from the
outside can do a lot of damage

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.112
from the outside.

00:47:12.112 --> 00:47:13.820
The alphas and the
betas would be stopped

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.530
by your skin and clothes.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.072
The gamma rays, almost all of
them will go right through you.

00:47:18.072 --> 00:47:20.322
And you guys will actually
have to do this calculation

00:47:20.322 --> 00:47:22.010
to find out how many
gamma rays would

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.803
you absorb from a
gamma ray emission,

00:47:23.803 --> 00:47:25.220
and how many go
right through you.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.760
The hint is most
of them get out.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.590
So there's an exam
question we used

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.080
to ask in 22.01 that I was
asked during the first exam,

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.340
is you've got four cookies, an
alpha emitter, a beta emitter,

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.690
a gamma emitter, and a neutron
emitter of constant energy

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.890
and activity.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.940
You must do one
of the following.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.320
You have to hold one in
your hand at arm's length.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.270
You have to put
one in your pocket.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:55.400
You have to eat one, and you
have to give one to a friend.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.582
What do you do and why?

00:47:58.582 --> 00:48:00.025
Anyone have an idea?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:03.940
Pop quiz.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.220
Yeah?

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.323
AUDIENCE: Probably give the
neutron one to a friend.

00:48:08.323 --> 00:48:09.490
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:11.198
I can tell this is
the west, because when

00:48:11.198 --> 00:48:14.680
I asked a group of Singaporean
students the same question,

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.560
they would eat the neutron
to save the friend because

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.150
of Confucian ethics.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.190
Yeah, it doesn't fly here.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.717
Your answer is correct
because this is America.

00:48:24.717 --> 00:48:26.342
What would you do
with the other three?

00:48:26.342 --> 00:48:27.580
AUDIENCE: Eat the gamma.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.872
MICHAEL SHORT: Eat the gamma
because most of the gammas

00:48:29.872 --> 00:48:32.590
will just get to
the friend, right?

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.560
What about the
alpha and the beta?

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:41.807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:41.807 --> 00:48:42.640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.515
Hold the beta at arm's
length because there's

00:48:44.515 --> 00:48:47.320
another aspect of shielding
betas that we'll get into.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.240
When betas stop
in material, they

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.013
produce some low energy
x-rays called bremsstrahlung.

00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:53.680
So you'd want to get
those far from you.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.600
And the alpha in
your pocket will just

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.920
be absorbed by the pocket.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.640
Yeah, so that's
the right question.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.130
So you're not going to
see that on the exam.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:03.530
But good news is you pretty
much got the right answer

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:06.080
because this is America.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.600
Probably time for one more
question if anyone has one.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:13.010
Cool.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.240
If not, then I
want to remind you

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.770
Amelia will see you on Thursday,
so do come to class Thursday.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:21.950
I'm going to change the
syllabus to reflect that.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.230
And we'll have two
hours of class on Friday

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:27.260
to get through decay and
activity and half life,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.140
followed by an
hour of recitation.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.373
So I will see you
guys Friday, and we'll

00:49:32.373 --> 00:49:34.790
see what mood I'm in depending
on how the nano calorimetry

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:37.220
goes.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.900
Could be a fun measurement.

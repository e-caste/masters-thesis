00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.715
PROFESSOR: So everybody
ready to rock and roll today?

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.140
Or at least roll?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350
OK, if not rock.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100
Welcome back to lecture 20.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.900
On Thursday, we have a special
guest appearance just for you

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.260
from Professor Ron Weiss.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.102
He's going to be talking
about synthetic biology.

00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:48.220
You know, on Richard
Feynman's blackboard,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.520
when he died, was a little
statement I've always

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.340
really enjoyed that was actually
encased in a little chalk line.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.820
And it said, "What I cannot
create, I do not understand."

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.220
And so synthetic
biology is one way

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.027
to approach questions in
the biological sciences

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:05.610
by seeing what we
can make-- you know,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.789
whole organisms, new
genomes, rewiring circuitry.

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.330
So I think you'll find it to be
a very interesting discussion

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.720
on Thursday.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.170
But first, before we talk
about synthetic biology,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.300
we have the very
exciting discussion today

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.150
on human genetics, which of
course concerns all of us.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.670
And so we're going to
have an exploration today.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.350
And you know, as I
prepared today's lecture,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.110
I wanted to give you the latest
and greatest research findings.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.910
So we're going to talk today
from fundamental techniques

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.560
to things that are very
controversial that have caused

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.300
fistfights in bars, so
I'm hopeful that you'll

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.310
be as engaged as the
people drinking beer are.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.270
So we'll be turning to that
at the end of the lecture,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.810
but first I wanted to tell you
about the broad narrative arc

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230
once again that we're going
to be talking about today.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.510
And we're going to
be looking at how

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.000
to discover human variation.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.450
We're all different, about
1 based in every 1,000.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920
And there are two different
broad approaches historically

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.639
people have used.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.816
Microarrays for
discovering variants,

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.690
and we'll talk about
how those were designed.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.926
And we'll talk about
how to actually test

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.550
for the significance
of human variation

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.930
with respect to a particular
disease in a case and control

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.890
study.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.530
And then we'll talk about how
to use whole genome read data

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.750
to detect variation
between humans

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.610
and some of the
challenges in that,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.870
because it does not
make as many assumptions

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.230
as the microarray studies,
and therefore is much, much

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.220
more complicated to process.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.930
And so we're going to
take a view into the best

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.280
practices of processing
human read data

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.000
so you can understand what
the state of the art is.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.450
And then we're going to
turn to a study showing

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.090
how we can bring together
different threads we've

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170
talked about in this subject.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.440
In particular, we've
talked about the idea

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.090
that we can use other genomic
signals such as histone marks

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.860
to identify things like
regulatory elements.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.470
So we're going to talk about
how we can take that lens

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.610
and focus it on the
genome to discover

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.770
particular genomic variants that
have been revealed to be very

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.700
important in a
particular disease.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.500
And finally, we'll
talk about the idea

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.900
that what-- the beginning
we're going to talk about today

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.950
is all about correlation.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.280
And as all of you go forward
in your scientific career,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.170
I'm hopeful that you'll always
be careful to not confuse

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.630
association or correlation
with causation.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.424
You're always respected
when you clearly

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.840
articulate the difference when
you're giving a talk saying

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.670
that this is correlated,
but we don't necessarily

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.490
know it's causative until we do
the right set of experiments.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.917
OK, on that note, we'll turn
to the computational approaches

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:01.000
we're going to talk about.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.920
We'll talk about contingency
tables and various ways

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.210
of thinking about
them when we discuss

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.710
how to identify whether or not
a particular SNP is associated

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.500
with a disease using
various kinds of tests.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.269
And then we talk
about read data,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.170
and we'll talk about
likelihood based tests.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.830
How to do things like
take a population

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.540
of individuals and
their read data

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.900
and estimate the
genotypic frequencies

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.410
at a particular
locus using that data

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.660
in toto using EM
based techniques.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.670
OK?

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.740
So let us begin then.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300
Some of the things we're
not going to talk about

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.470
include non-random
genotyping failure,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.410
methods to correct for
population stratification,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.880
and structural variants
and copy number variations.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.480
Point three we'll
just briefly touch on,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.910
but fundamentally they're
just embellishments

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.360
on the fundamental techniques
we're talking about,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.170
and so I didn't really want
to confuse today's discussion.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.300
Now a Mendelian
disorder is a disorder

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.250
defined by a single gene,
and therefore, they're

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.930
relatively easy to map.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.060
And they also tend to
be in low frequency

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.220
in the population because
they're selected against,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.290
especially the more severe
Mendelian disorders.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.210
And therefore, they correspond
to very rare mutations

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.100
in the population.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.460
By point of contrast, if you
thought about the genetics

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.802
we discussed last
time, if you think

00:05:40.802 --> 00:05:42.260
about a trait that
actually perhaps

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.410
is influenced by 200 genes and
maybe that one of those genes

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.140
is not necessary or sufficient
for a particular disease.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.340
As a consequence, it could
be a fairly common variant

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.030
and it's only if you're unlucky
enough to get all the other 199

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.720
variants will you actually
come down with that syndrome.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.380
And therefore, you can see
that the effect of variation

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.210
in the human genome
is inversely related

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.660
to its frequency-- that
fairly rare variants can have

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.990
very serious effects, whereas
fairly common variants tend

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.220
to have fewer effects.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.360
And in the first phase of
mapping human variation,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.120
people thought that
common variants

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.030
were things that had
an allelic frequency

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.980
in the population
of 5% or greater.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.940
And then to burrow down deeper,
the 1000 Genomes Project

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.220
surveyed a collection of
different populations.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.930
And therefore, if you
thought that a variant was

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.800
prevalent in the
population at frequency

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.840
of 0.5%, how many people
would have in the 1000 Genomes

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.620
Project roughly?

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.140
Just make sure among you
we're phase-locked here.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.630
0.5%, 1,000 people--

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.130
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.100
PROFESSOR: 5, great.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.070
OK.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.930
Good.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.530
Now of course, these are three
different populations or more,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.430
and so it might be that,
in fact, that variant's

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.120
only present in one
of the population.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.661
So it just might be
one or two people

00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:13.170
that actually have a
particular variant.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:19.320
So the idea is that the way that
you design SNP chips to detect

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.430
single nucleotide polymorphisms,
otherwise known as "SNPs,"

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.110
is that you do these
population-based sequencing

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.790
studies and you
design the array based

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.880
upon all of the common
variants that you find, OK?

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.300
And therefore, the array
gives you a direct readout

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.790
in terms of the
variation, in terms

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.920
of all of these common variants.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.810
That's where we'll start today.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.540
And where we'll end today is
sequencing based approaches,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.800
which make no assumptions
whatsoever and just all hell

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.310
breaks loose.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.640
So you'll see what happens, OK?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.050
But I wanted just to
reinforce the idea

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.970
that there are different
allelic frequencies of variants

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.630
and that as we get down to
rarer and rarer alleles, right,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.670
we have larger effects.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.300
But these higher
frequency alleles

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.810
could also have effects even
though they're much smaller.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.490
OK, so let's talk about
how these variants arise

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.730
and what they mean in terms
of a small little cartoon.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.040
So long, long ago,
in a world far,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.930
far away, a mutation
occurred where

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.980
a base G got mutated
to a base A, OK?

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.510
And this was in the context of
a population of individuals--

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.809
all happy, smiling individuals
because they all actually

00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:46.725
do not have a disease.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.360
And our story goes,
what happens is

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.620
that we had yet another
generation of people who

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.931
are all happy, smiling because
they do not have the disease.

00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:58.430
Right?

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.800
Yes, I do tell
stories at night, too.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:12.290
And then another
mutation occurred.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.660
And that mutation caused
some subset of those people

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.730
to get the mutation and for
them to get the disease.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.700
So the original mutation was
not sufficient for people

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.560
to get this genetic disease.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.600
It required a second
mutation for them

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.380
to get the genetic disease, OK?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.093
So we got at least two
genes involved in it.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.710
OK, the other thing
that we know is

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.870
that, in this particular
case, some of the people

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.750
have the disease that
don't have this mutation.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.640
And therefore, this
mutation is not necessary.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.700
It's neither necessary
nor sufficient.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.790
Still, it is a marker of a
gene that increases risk.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.540
And that's a
fundamental idea, right,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.760
that you can increase
risk without being

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.470
necessary or sufficient to cause
a particular genetic disorder.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.570
OK?

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.080
And so you get this association
then between genotype

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.580
and phenotype, and
that's what we're

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.220
going to go looking
for right now.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.340
We're on the hunt.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.360
We're going to go looking
for this relationship.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.550
So in certain older
individuals-- hopefully,

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.620
not myself in the
future-- what happens

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.890
is that your maculus, which
is the center of your eye,

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.140
degenerates as shown here.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.460
And you get this
unfortunate property

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.820
where you can't actually
see in the center

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.590
of your field of vision.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.400
It's called age-related
macular degeneration.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.900
So to look for the
causes of this, which

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.950
is known to be
genetically related,

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.140
the authors of the study
collected a collection--

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.380
a cohort, as it's called--
of these European-descent

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.330
individuals, all who are at
least 60 years old, to study

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.180
the genetic foundations
for this disorder.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:17.950
And so they found
934 controls that

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:24.720
were unaffected by age-related
macular degeneration and 1,238

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.525
cases, and they genotyped
them all using arrays.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.190
Now the question is, are
any of the identified

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:40.410
SNPs on the array related
to this particular disorder?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.854
So I'll give you
the answer first

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:46.270
and then we'll
talk about a couple

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.210
of different ways of
thinking about this data, OK?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.260
So here's the answer.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.330
Here's a particular
SNP, rs1061170.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.272
There are the individuals
with AMD and the controls.

00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:02.730
And what you're
looking at up here,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.010
these numbers are the
allelic counts, all right?

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.360
So each person has
how many alleles?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.760
Two, right?

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.580
That's double the
number of individuals.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.460
And the question is,
are the C and T alleles

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:24.770
associated with the cases
or controls significantly?

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.670
And so you can compute
a Chi-square metric

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.820
on this so-called
contingency table.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.217
And one of the things
about contingency tables

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:33.800
that I think is
important to point out

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.910
is that you hear about
marginal probabilities, right?

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.640
And people probably
know that originally

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.340
derived from the
idea of these margins

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.390
along the side of a
contingency table, right?

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.490
If you think about the marginal
probability of somebody

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.470
having a C allele, regardless
of whether a case or control,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:55.980
it would be 2,192
over 4,344, right?

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.440
So the formula for computing
the Chi-square statistic

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.710
is shown here.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.460
It's this sort of
scary-looking polynomial.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.730
And the number of
degrees of freedom is 1.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.950
It's the number of rows
minus 1 times the number

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.880
of columns minus 1.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.420
And the P-value we get is
indeed quite small-- 10

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.450
to the minus 62.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.920
Therefore, the
chance this happened

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.670
at random-- even with
multiple hypothesis

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.240
correction, given that we're
testing a million SNPs--

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.600
is indeed very, very low.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.680
This looks like a winner.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.940
Looks like we've got a
SNP that is associated

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.530
with this particular disease.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.110
Now just to remind you about
Chi-square statistics--

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.090
I'm sure people have seen this
before-- the usual formulation

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:50.150
is that you compute this
Chi-square polynomial

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.454
on the right-hand side,
which is the observed

00:13:52.454 --> 00:13:54.870
number of something minus the
expected number of something

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.560
squared over the expected
number or something, right?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.874
And you sum it up over
all the different cases.

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:03.790
And you can see that the
expected number of As

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.350
is given by the little
formula on the left.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.380
Suffice to say, if you expand
that formula and manipulate it,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.230
you get the equation we
had on the previous slide.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.060
So it's still that fuzzy,
friendly Chi-square formula

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.780
you always knew, just
in a different form, OK?

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.150
Now is there
another way to think

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.140
about computing the likelihood
of seeing data in a contingency

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.910
table at random, right?

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.260
Because we're always asking,
could this just be random?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.380
I mean, could this have
occurred by chance,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.130
that we see the data arranged
in this particular form?

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.460
Well, we've another
convenient way

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.240
of thinking about
this, which is we could

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.400
do Fisher's Exact Test,
which is very related

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.477
to the idea of the
hypergeometric test

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.060
that we've talked
about before, right?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.810
What are the chances we would
see exactly this arrangement?

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.640
Well, we would need to have,
out of a plus b C alleles,

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:14.150
we'd have 8 of them be cases,
which is the first term there

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.000
in that equation.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.536
And of the T alleles, we need to
have c of them out of c plus d

00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:23.540
be there.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.260
And then we need to have a
plus b plus c plus d choose

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.080
a plus c-- that's the
total number of chances

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.290
of seeing things.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.440
So this is the probability
of the arrangement

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.970
in the table in this
particular form.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.750
Now people-- I'll let
you digest that for one

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.040
second before I go on.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:51.380
So this is the number of ways
on the numerator of arranging

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.830
things to get the table
the way that we see it

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.280
over the total number or
ways of arranging the table,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.180
keeping the marginal
totals the same.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.960
Is that clear?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.390
So this is the probability,
the exact probability,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.080
of seeing the table
in this configuration.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.555
And then what you do is you
take that probability and all

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:19.220
of the probabilities for all the
more extreme values, say, of a.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.960
And you sum them all
up and that gives you

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.930
the probability of
a null hypothesis.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.850
So this is another
way to approach

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.660
looking at the chance a
particular contingency table

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.160
set of values would
occur at random.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.860
So if people talk about
Fisher's Exact Test-- you know,

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.264
tonight at that cocktail party.

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.430
"Oh yeah, I know about that.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.680
Yeah, it's like
the hypergeometric.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.410
It's no big deal."

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.880
You know?

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.379
Right.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.930
All right.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:55.390
So now let us suppose that
we do an association test

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.060
and you do the following design.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.330
You say, well, I've
got all my cases.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.663
They're all at Mass General and
I want to genotype them all.

00:17:05.663 --> 00:17:07.079
And Mass General
is the best place

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.454
for this particular disease,
so I'm going to go up there.

00:17:09.454 --> 00:17:12.680
I need some controls but I'm
running out of budgetary money,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.974
so I'm going to do all my
controls in China, right?

00:17:15.974 --> 00:17:18.140
Because I know it's going
to be less expensive there

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.990
to genotype them.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.350
And furthermore--
as a little aside,

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.849
I was once meeting
with this guy who

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:30.000
is like one of the ministers
of research in China.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.010
He came to my office.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.135
I said, so what do
you do in China?

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.260
And he said, well, I guess
the best way to describe

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.990
it is that I'm in charge of the
equivalent of the NSF, DARPA,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.345
and the NIH.

00:17:39.345 --> 00:17:41.810
I said, oh.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.200
I said, would like to
meet the president?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.290
Because I'd be happy to
call MIT's president.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.350
I'm sure they'd be
happy to meet with you.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.230
He said, no.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.430
He said, I like going direct.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.150
So, at any rate,
I told him I was

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.680
working in stem cell research.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.590
He said, you know, one thing I
can say about China-- in China,

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.370
stem cells, ethics, no problem.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.510
At any rate, so you go to
China to do your controls, OK?

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.180
And why is that a bad
experimental design?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.020
Can anybody tell me?

00:18:18.128 --> 00:18:20.544
You do all your cases here,
you do your controls in China.

00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:20.996
Yes?

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:22.454
AUDIENCE: Because
the SNPs in China

00:18:22.454 --> 00:18:23.710
are not necessarily the same.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:24.390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.340
The Chinese population's
going to have

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.193
a different set of SNPs,
right, because it's

00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:29.392
been a contained population.

00:18:29.392 --> 00:18:31.100
So you're going to
pick up all these SNPs

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.720
that you think are going to
be related to the disease that

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.770
are simply a consequence of
population stratification,

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.870
right?

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.990
So what you need to do
is to control for that.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.030
And the way you do that is you
pick a bunch of control SNPs

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.570
that you think are
unrelated to a disease

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.560
and you do a Chi-square
test on those

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.950
to make sure that they're
not significant, right?

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.630
And methodologies for
controlling for population

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.650
stratification by picking
apart your individuals

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.861
and re-clustering
them is something

00:19:00.861 --> 00:19:02.360
that is a topic of
current research.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.630
And finally, the good news
about age-related macular

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.540
degeneration is that
there are three genes

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.680
with five common variants
that explain 50% of the risk.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.840
And so it has been viewed as
sort of a very successful study

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.220
of a polygenic-- that
is, multiple gene--

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.240
genetic disorder that
has been dissected

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.480
using this methodology.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.790
And with these genes, now
people can go after them

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.010
and see if they can come up
appropriate therapeutics.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:41.340
Now using the same idea-- cases,
controls-- you look at each SNP

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.570
individually and you
query it for significance

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.470
based upon a null model.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:53.000
You can take a wide
range of common diseases

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.380
and ask whether or
not you can detect

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:03.450
any genetic elements that
might influence risk.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.250
And so here are a set
of different diseases,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.000
starting with bipolar
disorder at the top,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.740
going down to type 2
diabetes at the bottom.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.220
This is a so-called
Manhattan plot,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.222
because you see the buildings
along the plot, right?

00:20:17.222 --> 00:20:18.680
And when there are
skyscrapers, you

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.820
go, whoa, that could be
a problem, all right?

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.630
And so this is the
style-- you see,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.250
this came out in
2007-- of research

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:32.272
that attempts to do genome
wide scans for loci that

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:33.730
are related to
particular diseases.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:42.500
OK, now, I'd like to go on
and talk about other ways

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:50.390
that these studies can
be influenced, which

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:58.490
is the idea of linkage
disequilibrium.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:14.810
So for example, let us say that
I have a particular individual

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:20.470
who's going to produce a
gamete and the gamete's going

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.490
to be haploid, right?

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:30.320
And it's going have one
allele from one of these two

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.830
chromosomes and one allele from
one of these two chromosomes.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.590
We've talked about
this before last time.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.670
And there are four
possibilities--

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:48.520
AB, aB, Ab, and ab, OK?

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.820
And if this was a
coin flip, then each

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.570
of these genotypes
for this gamete

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.800
would be identical, right?

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.460
But let us suppose
that I tell you

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:10.270
that there are only two
that result-- this one, AB,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.975
and the small one, ab, OK?

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.880
If you look at this, you
say, aha, these two things

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.270
are linked and they're
very closely linked.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.960
And so, if they're always
inherited together,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:35.550
we might think that the distance
between them on the genome

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.820
is small.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.870
So in the human genome,
what's the average distance

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.950
between crossover events
during a meiotic event?

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.641
Does anybody know, roughly
speaking, how many bases?

00:22:49.641 --> 00:22:50.140
Hm?

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.014
AUDIENCE: A megabase?

00:22:51.014 --> 00:22:51.950
PROFESSOR: A megabase.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.130
Little low.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.460
How many centimorgans
long is the human genome?

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.211
All right?

00:23:05.211 --> 00:23:08.150
Anybody know?

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.900
3,000?

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.676
4,000?

00:23:10.676 --> 00:23:13.120
Something like that?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:19.240
So maybe 50 to 100 megabases
between crossover events, OK?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:28.620
So if these markers
are very closely

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.660
organized along the genome,
the likelihood of a crossover

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.930
is very small.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.460
And therefore, they're going
to be in very high LD, right?

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.340
And a way to measure that is
with the following formula,

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.810
which is that if you link the
two locuses-- we have L1 and L2

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:50.830
here.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.740
And now we're talking about
the population instead

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.080
of a particular individual.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:03.740
If the likelihood of the
capital allele A is piece of A

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.650
and the probability
of the big B allele

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:12.434
is piece of B, then if they
were completely unlinked,

00:24:12.434 --> 00:24:14.350
then the likelihood of
inheriting both of them

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.320
together with would be
piece of A times piece of B,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.520
showing independence.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.720
However if they
aren't independent,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.340
we can come up
with a single value

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:30.150
D which allows us to quantify
the amount of disequilibrium

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.550
between those two alleles.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.090
And the formula for D
is given on the slide.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.570
And furthermore, if it's
more convenient for you

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.190
to think about in terms
of r-squared correlation,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.420
we can define the
r-squared correlation

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.420
as D squared over
PA, QA, PB, QB,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.660
as shown in the lower left
hand part of this slide, OK?

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.530
This is simply a
way of describing

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.490
how skewed the
probabilities are from being

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.360
independent for
inheriting these two

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.850
different loci in a population.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.880
Are there any questions
at all about that,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.140
the details of that?

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.940
OK.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:20.800
So just to give you an example,
if you look at chromosome 22,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.460
the physical distance on
the bottom is in kilobases,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.910
so that's from 0 to 1
megabase on the bottom.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.140
And you look at the
r-squared values,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.640
you can see things that
are quite physically close,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.860
as we suggested earlier,
have a high r-squared value.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.360
But there are still
some things that

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.230
are pretty far away
that have surprisingly

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.505
high r-squared values.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.890
There are recombination
hot spots in the genome.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.690
And it's, once again, a topic
of current research trying

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.020
to figure out how the genome
recombines and recombination is

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.717
targeted.

00:25:56.717 --> 00:25:59.050
But suffice it to say, as you
can see, it's not uniform.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.140
Now what happens as
a consequence of this

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.640
is that you get regions
of the genome where

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.060
things stick together, right?

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.560
They're all drinking
buddies, right?

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.870
They all hang out together, OK?

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.740
But here's what I'm going to ask
you-- how much of your genome

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.740
came from your dad?

00:26:21.392 --> 00:26:22.280
Half.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.762
How much came from
your dad's dad?

00:26:23.762 --> 00:26:24.908
AUDIENCE: A quarter.

00:26:24.908 --> 00:26:26.616
PROFESSOR: And from
your dad's dad's dad?

00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:27.449
AUDIENCE: An eighth.

00:26:27.449 --> 00:26:28.600
PROFESSOR: An eighth, OK?

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.730
So the amount of your genome
going back up the family tree

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.660
is falling off exponentially
up a particular path, right?

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.970
So if you think about groups
of things that came together

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.440
from your great,
great grandfather

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.910
or his great, great
grandfather, right,

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.159
the further back you go, the
less and less contribution

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.700
they're going to
have to your genome.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.580
And so the blocks are
going to be smaller--

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.470
that is, the amount
of information

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.200
you're getting from
way back up the tree.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.060
So if you think about
this, the question

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.570
of what blocks of things
are inherited together

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.390
is not something that you
can write an equation for.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.580
It's something that you
study in a population.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.860
You go out and you
ask, what things do we

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.390
observe coming together?

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.340
And generally, larger
blocks of things

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.760
are inherited together, occur
in more recent generations,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.930
because there's less
dilution, right?

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.256
Whereas if you go way
back in time-- not quite

00:27:24.256 --> 00:27:25.880
to where the dinosaurs
roamed the land,

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.720
but you get the idea-- the
blocks are, fact, quite small.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.890
And so, the HapMap project
went about looking at blocks

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.700
and how they were
inherited in the genome.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.430
And what suffices to know is
that they found blocks-- here

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.460
you can see three
different blocks.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.450
And these are called
haplotype blocks

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.400
and the things that
are colored red

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.820
are high r-squared
values between

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.360
different genetic markers.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.110
And we talked earlier
about how to compute

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.600
that r-squared value.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.650
So those blocks typically
are inherited together.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.150
Yes?

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.776
AUDIENCE: Are these blocks
like fuzzy boundaries?

00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:07.580
PROFESSOR: No.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.520
Well, remember in this
particular example,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.910
we're only querying at
specified markers which

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.010
are not necessarily at regular
intervals along the genome.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.660
So in this case, the blocks
don't have fuzzy boundaries.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.122
As we get into
sequencing-based approaches,

00:28:24.122 --> 00:28:25.580
they could have
fuzzier boundaries.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.080
But haplotype
blocks are typically

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.080
thought to be discrete blocks
that are inherited, OK?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.690
Good question.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:32.523
Any other questions?

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.350
OK.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.040
So I want to impress
upon the idea

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.050
that this is empirical, right?

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.010
There's no magic here in
terms of fundamental theory

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.640
about what things should
be haplotype blocks.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.550
It's simply that you
look at a population

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.680
and you're look at what
markers are drinking buddies

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.750
and those make haplotype blocks
and you empirically categorize

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:04.220
and catalog them-- which can
be very helpful, as you'll see.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.150
And thus, when we think
about genetic studies,

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.990
when we think about the
length of shared segments,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.980
if you're thinking
about studying a family,

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.934
like a trio-- a trio is a mom,
a dad, and a child, right?

00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:19.100
They're going to share a
lot of genetic information,

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.960
and so the haplotype blocks that
are shared amongst those three

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.390
individuals are going
to be very large indeed.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.310
Whereas if you go
back generations,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.090
the blocks-- like the
second cousins or things

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.180
like that-- the
blocks get smaller.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.260
So the x-axis on this
plot is the median length

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.480
of a shared segment.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.410
And as an association
study, which

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:44.260
is taking random people
out of the population,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.154
has very small shared
blocks indeed, OK?

00:29:48.154 --> 00:29:50.070
And so the techniques
that we're talking about

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.030
today are applicable
almost in any range,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.660
but they're particularly
useful where

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.780
you can't depend upon
the fact that you're

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.250
sharing a lot of information
along the genome proximal

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.162
to where the marker
is that's associated

00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:03.245
with a particular disease.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.770
Now the other thing
that is true is

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:15.120
that we should note that
the fact that markers have

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.110
this LD associated
with them means

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:25.300
that it may be that a particular
marker is bang on-- what's

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.190
called a causative SNP.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.230
Or something that,
for example, sits

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.650
in the middle of a gene
causing a missense mutation.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.610
Or it sits right in the middle
of a protein binding site,

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.490
causing the factor
not to bind anymore.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.320
But also it could be something
that is actually a little bit

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.080
away, but is highly correlated
to the causative SNP.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.530
So just keep in mind that
when you have an association

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:55.930
and you're looking at a SNP, it
may not be the causative SNP.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.644
It might be just linked
to the causative SNP.

00:30:58.644 --> 00:31:00.685
And sometimes these things
are called proxy SNPs.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:12.530
OK, so we've talked
about the idea of SNPs

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.460
and discovering them.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.515
Let me ask you one more question
about where these SNPs reside

00:31:19.515 --> 00:31:21.230
and see if you
could help me out.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:38.500
OK, this is a really
important gene, OK?

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.920
Call it RIG for short, OK?

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.350
Now let us suppose that
you know that there

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.100
are some mutations here.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:52.080
And my question for you is,
does it matter whether or not

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:58.410
the two mutations look
like this or the mutations

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:03.260
look like this, in your opinion?

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.470
That is, both mutations
occur in one copy

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.330
or on one chromosome
of the gene,

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.340
whereas in the other case, we
see two different SNPs that

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.110
are different than
reference, but they're

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.240
referring in both
mom and dad alleles.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.391
Is there a difference
between those two cases?

00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:28.890
Yeah?

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.846
AUDIENCE: In terms of
the phenotype displayed?

00:32:30.846 --> 00:32:33.291
PROFESSOR: In terms of
the phenotype, sorry.

00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:34.758
AUDIENCE: It depends.

00:32:34.758 --> 00:32:35.736
PROFESSOR: It depends?

00:32:35.736 --> 00:32:36.319
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:37.203
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:37.203 --> 00:32:41.115
AUDIENCE: So if it causes a
recessive mutation, then no,

00:32:41.115 --> 00:32:46.494
because other genes will
be able to rescue it.

00:32:46.494 --> 00:32:48.161
But if it's dominant,
then it'll still--

00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:50.077
PROFESSOR: It's actually
the other way around.

00:32:50.077 --> 00:32:51.880
If it's recessive,
this does matter.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.470
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.720
PROFESSOR: Because in this
case, with the purple ones,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.240
you still have one good
copy of the gene, right?

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.100
However, with the
green ones, it's

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.310
possible that you have
ablated both good copies

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.680
of the gene, this
really important gene,

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.910
and therefore, you're
going to get a higher

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:12.280
risk of having a
genetic disorder.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.430
So when you're scanning down
the genome then-- you know,

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.680
we've been asking where
are there differences

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.440
from reference or from
between cases and controls

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.330
down the genome, but we
haven't asked whether or not

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.299
they're on mom or dad, right?

00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:32.715
We're just asking,
are they there?

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:39.200
But it turns out that
for questions like this,

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.550
we have to know whether or
not the mutation occurred

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.450
in only in mom's chromosome
or in both chromosomes

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:53.200
in this particular
neighborhood, all right?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.060
This is called phasing
of the variants.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.260
Phasing means
placing the variants

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.340
on a particular chromosome.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.300
And then, by phasing
the variants,

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.139
you can figure out some
of the possible phenotypic

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.830
consequences of them.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.830
Because if they're not
they phased, in this case,

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.844
it's going to be much less
clear what's going on.

00:34:19.844 --> 00:34:21.219
So then the question
becomes, how

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.020
do we phase variants, right?

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:28.670
So phasing assigns alleles
to the parental chromosomes.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.000
And so, the set of alleles along
a chromosomes is a haplotype.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.980
We've talked about the
idea of haplotypes.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:41.780
So imagine one way to phase
is that if I tell you,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.880
by magic, in this population
you're looking at,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.040
here are all the
haplotypes and these

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.610
are the only ones that exist.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.590
You look in your
haplotypes and you go, aha,

00:34:54.590 --> 00:35:00.560
this haplotype exists but
this one does not, right?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.540
That this is a haplotype--
this two purples together

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.310
is a haplotype, and
this green without one

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.555
is another haplotype.

00:35:06.555 --> 00:35:10.690
So you see which
haplotypes exist-- that is,

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:15.370
what patterns of inheritance
of alleles along a chromosome

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.600
you can detect.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.080
And using the established
empirical haplotypes,

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.190
you can phase the variants, OK?

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.580
Now the other way to
phase the variants

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.084
is much, much simpler
and much better, right?

00:35:32.084 --> 00:35:33.500
The other way to
phase variants is

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:39.330
you just have a single read that
covers the entire thing, right?

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.110
And then the read, it
will be manifest, right?

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.230
The read will cover
the entire region

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.990
and then you see
the two mutations

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.850
in that single
region of the genome.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.410
The problem we're up against
is that most of our reads

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:56.340
are quite short and we're
reassembling our genotypes

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.140
from a shattered genome.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.320
If the genome wasn't
shattered, then we

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.320
wouldn't have this problem.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.780
So everybody's
working to fix this.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:12.090
Illumina has sort of a
cute trick for fixing this.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.350
And PacBio, which is
another sequence instrument

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.970
manufacturer, can produce reads
that are tens of thousands

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.174
of bases long, which allows
you to directly phase

00:36:22.174 --> 00:36:23.340
the variants from the reads.

00:36:25.519 --> 00:36:27.060
But if somebody,
once again, comes up

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.650
to you at the cocktail party
tonight and says, you know,

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:34.250
I've never understood why
you have to phase variants.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.010
You know, this is a popular
question I get all the time.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.754
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.754 --> 00:36:41.420
You can tell them,
hey, you know,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.620
you have to know whether or
not mom and dad both have

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.040
got big problems or just all
the problems are with mom, OK?

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.450
Or dad.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.680
So you can put
their mind at ease

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.610
as you're finishing
off the hors d'oeuvres.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.240
OK, so I wanted just to tell
you about phasing variants

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.400
because we're about to go on to
the next part of our discussion

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.860
today.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.030
We are leaving the very
clean and pristine world

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.550
of very defined SNPs,
defined by microarrays,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:16.030
into the wild and woolly world
of sequencing data, right?

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.840
Which is all bets are off.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.370
It's all raw
sequencing data and you

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.500
have to make sense
of it-- hundreds

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.430
of millions of sequencing reads.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.480
So today's lecture is drawn from
a couple of different sources.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.720
I've posted some of
them on the internet.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.600
There's a very nice article
by Heng Li on the underlying

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.010
mathematics of SNP calling and
variation which I've posted.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.750
In addition, some of
the material today

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.180
is taken from the Genome
Analysis Toolkit, which

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.360
is a set of tools
over at the Broad,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.922
and we'll be talking about
that during today's lecture.

00:37:53.922 --> 00:37:56.380
The best possible case when
you're looking at sequence data

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.000
today is that you get
something like this, all right?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.340
Which is that you have
a collection of reads

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:07.370
for one individual and you
align them to the genome

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.380
and then you see that
some of the reads

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.690
have a C at a particular base
position and other of the reads

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.490
have a T at that base position.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.660
And so it's a very
clean call, right?

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.980
You have a CT heterozygote
at that position-- that

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.240
is, whatever person that
is is a heterozygote there.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.816
You can see the reference genome
at the very bottom, right?

00:38:29.816 --> 00:38:31.940
So it's very difficult for
you to read in the back,

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.750
but C is the reference allele.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:38.570
And the way that
the IGV viewer works

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.140
is that it shows non-reference
alleles in color,

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.410
so all those are the T alleles
you see there in red, OK?

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.667
And it's very, very
beautiful, right?

00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:51.500
I mean you can tell
exactly what's going on.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.890
Now we don't know whether
or not the C or the T allele

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.827
are a mom and dad
respectively, right?

00:38:57.827 --> 00:38:59.910
We don't know which of the
chromosomes they're on,

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:04.340
but suffice to say,
it's very clean.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.300
And the way that all of
this starts, of course,

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.880
is with a BAM file.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.760
You guys have seen
BAM files before.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.370
I'm not going to belabor this.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.470
There's a definition
here and you

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.482
can add extra
annotations on BAM files.

00:39:16.482 --> 00:39:18.190
But the other thing
I wanted to point out

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.750
is that you know that BAM
files include quality scores.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.450
So we'll be using those quality
scores in our discussion.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.050
The output of all
this typically is

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:34.320
something called a variant
call file or a VCF file.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.810
And just so you are
not completely scared

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.990
by these files, I want to
describe just a little bit

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.510
about their structure.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.800
So there's a header
at the top telling you

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.560
what you actually did.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.270
And then chromosome 20 at this
base location has this SNP.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.110
The reference allele is
G, the alternative allele

00:39:56.110 --> 00:40:00.444
is A. This is some
of the statistics

00:40:00.444 --> 00:40:02.110
as described by this
header information,

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.240
like DP is the read depth.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.870
And this tells you the status
of a trio that you processed.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:21.969
So this is the
allele number for one

00:40:21.969 --> 00:40:23.510
of the chromosomes,
which is 0, which

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.610
is a G. The other one's
a G, and so forth.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.657
And then this data right
here is GT, GQ, GP,

00:40:30.657 --> 00:40:31.740
which are defined up here.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.820
So you have one person,
second person, third person,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.990
along with which one
of the alleles, 0 or 1,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.110
they have on each of
their chromosomes, OK?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.480
So this is the output.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.850
You put in raw reads
and what you get out

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.250
is a VCF file that for
bases along the genome

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:55.260
calls variance, OK?

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.190
So that's all there
is to it, right?

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.530
You take in your read data.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.670
You take your genome, throw
it through the sequencer.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.300
You take the BAM file,
you call the variants,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.900
and then you make your
medical diagnosis, right?

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.390
So what we're going to
talk about is what goes on

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.300
in the middle there,
that little step-- how

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.510
do you actually
call the variants?

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.689
And you might say, gee,
that does not seem too hard.

00:41:18.689 --> 00:41:20.480
I mean, I looked at
the slide you showed me

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.970
with the CT heterozygote.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.670
That looked beautiful, right?

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.490
I mean, that was just gorgeous.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.440
I mean, these sequencers are
so great and do so many reads,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.870
what can be hard
about this, after all?

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.310
You know, it's a quarter
to 2:00, time to go home.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.170
Not quite, OK?

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:35.670
Not quite.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:40.390
The reason is actual
data looks like this.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.260
So these are all reads
aligned to the genome

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.134
and, as I told you
before, all the colors are

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:46.510
non-reference bases.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.520
And so you can see that
the reads that come out

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.070
of an individual are
very messy indeed.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.640
And so we need to deal with
those in a principled way.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.050
We need to make good,
probabilistic assessments of

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:04.340
whether or not there's a
variant at a particular base.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.400
And I'm not going to belabor
all the steps of the Genome

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.380
Analysis Toolkit,
suffice to say,

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.620
here is a flow chart of all
the steps that go through it.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.920
First, you map your reads.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.720
You recalibrate the scores.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.120
You compress the
read set and then

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.950
you have read sets for
n different individuals.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.430
And then you jointly call
the variants and then you

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:32.130
improve upon the variants
and then you evaluate, OK?

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:35.080
So I'll touch upon some of
the aspects of this pipeline,

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.090
the ones that I think
are most relevant,

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:41.400
so that you can appreciate
some of the complexity

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.232
in dealing with this.

00:42:43.232 --> 00:42:44.940
Let me begin with the
following question.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:54.750
Let us suppose that you have
a reference genome here,

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.180
indicated by this line,
and you align a read to it.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.705
And then there's some base
errors that are non-reference,

00:43:01.705 --> 00:43:05.470
so it's variants calls down
at this end of the read, OK?

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.950
So this is the five
prime, three prime.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:14.000
And then you align a read
from the opposite strand

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.710
and you have some variant
calls on the opposite end

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:21.660
of the read like this.

00:43:24.137 --> 00:43:26.470
And you'll say to yourself,
what could be going on here,

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.420
you know?

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.470
Why is it that they're
not concordant, right,

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:35.310
when they're mapped, but
they're in the same region

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:35.910
of the genome?

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.910
And then you think
to yourself, well,

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:45.737
what happens if I map this
successfully here correctly

00:43:45.737 --> 00:43:47.486
to the reference genome
and this correctly

00:43:47.486 --> 00:43:52.010
to the reference genome here,
but this individual actually

00:43:52.010 --> 00:44:01.236
had a chromosome that had
a deletion right here, OK?

00:44:01.236 --> 00:44:03.610
Then what would happen would
be that all these reads down

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.344
here are going to be
misaligned, all of these bases

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:08.260
are going to be misaligned
with the reference.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.590
And so you're going
to get variant calls.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.660
And these bases will be also
misaligned with the reference,

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.200
you'll get variant calls.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.410
So deletions in
an individual can

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.160
cause things to
be mapped but you

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.540
get variant calls at the end.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.750
And so that is shown
here, where you

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.620
have reads that are being mapped
and you have variant calls

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.330
at the end of the reads.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:38.810
And it's also a
little suspicious

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:44.980
because in the middle here is
a seven-base pair homopolymer

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.950
which is all T's.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.520
And as we know,
sequencers are notoriously

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.610
bad at correctly
reading homopolymers.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.700
So if you then
correct things, you

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.470
discover that some
fraction of the reads

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:07.070
actually have one of the T's
missing and all the variants

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.890
that were present
before go away.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:15.800
So this is a process
of INDEL adjustment

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.730
when you are mapping the
region looking for variants.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:26.190
Now this does not occur we're
talking about SNP microarrays.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.200
So this is a problem
that's unique to the fact

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.020
that we're making many
fewer assumptions when

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.350
we map reads to
the genome de novo.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.470
The second and another
very important step

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:44.090
that they're very proud
of is essentially--

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:46.400
I guess how to put this
politely-- finding out

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.120
that manufacturers of
sequencing instruments,

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.162
as you know, for every
base that they give you,

00:45:51.162 --> 00:45:52.995
they give you an estimate
of the probability

00:45:52.995 --> 00:45:56.240
that the base is correct--
or it's wrong, actually.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.350
A so-called Phred score--
we've talked about that before.

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:03.080
And as you would imagine,
manufacturers' instruments

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.320
are sometimes optimistic,
to say the least, about

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.300
the quality of their scores.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.310
And so they did a survey of
a whole bunch of instruments

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:17.002
and they plotted the reported
score against the actual score,

00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:18.360
OK?

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.510
And then they have a whole
step in their pipeline

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:24.850
to adjust the scores, whether
you be a Solexa GA instrument,

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:28.370
a 454 instrument, a SOLiD
instrument, a HiSeq instrument,

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.210
or what have you.

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:35.210
And there is a way to adjust the
score based upon the raw score

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.810
and also how far down
the read you are,

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.990
as the second line shows.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.240
The second line is a
function of score correction

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.150
versus how far down the read or
number of cycles you have gone.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:53.304
And the bottom is adjustments
for dinucleotides,

00:46:53.304 --> 00:46:54.720
because some
instruments are worse

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.566
a certain dinucleotides
than others.

00:46:56.566 --> 00:46:58.940
As you can see, they're very
proud of the upper left hand

00:46:58.940 --> 00:46:59.440
part.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.500
This is one of the major
methodological advances

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.610
of 1000 Genome
Project, figuring out

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:11.370
how to recalibrate quality
scores for instruments.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.320
Why is this so important?

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.290
The reason it's important
is that the estimate

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:23.080
of the veracity of
bases figures centrally

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.240
in determining whether or
not a variant is real or not.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.530
So you need to have as best
an estimate as you possibly

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:34.550
can of whether or not a base
coming out of the sequencer

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.660
is correct, OK?

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.060
Now if you're doing
lots of sequencing

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.980
of either individuals
or exomes--

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.710
I should talk about exome
sequencing for a moment.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.210
Up until recently,
it has not really

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.150
been practical to
do whole genome

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:56.580
sequencing of individuals.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:00.300
That's why these SNP arrays
were originally invented.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.550
Instead, people sequenced the
expressed part of the genome,

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.050
right?

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:08.150
All of the genes.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.160
And they can do this
by capture, right?

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.950
They go fishing.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:19.480
They create fishing poles out of
the genes that they care about

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.550
and they pull out the
sequences of those genes

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:23.610
and they sequence them.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.310
So you're looking at a
subset of the genome,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.970
but it's an important part.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.130
Nonetheless, whether or
not you do exome sequencing

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.020
or you do sequencing
of the entire genome,

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.590
you have a lot of reads.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:40.180
And so the reads that you
care about are the reads that

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.150
are different from reference.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:47.120
And so you can reduce the
representation of their BAM

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.510
file simply by throwing all
the reads on the floor that

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.180
don't matter, right?

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.100
And so here's an example of
the original BAM file and all

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.060
the reads, and what
you do is you just

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:01.730
trim it to only the
variable regions, right?

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.340
And so you are
stripping information

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:11.940
around the variant regions
out of the BAM file

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.790
and things greatly compress
and the downstream processing

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:16.965
becomes much more efficient.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.470
OK.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:26.240
Now let's turn to the
methodological approaches

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.770
once we have gotten the
data in as good a form

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:32.500
as we possibly can get it, we
have the best quality scores

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.930
that we can possibly
come up with,

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:40.430
and for every base position,
we have an indication

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:43.160
of how many reads say
that the base is this

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.000
and how many reads say
the base is that, OK?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.860
So we have these raw read counts
of the different allelic forms.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.250
And returning to this,
we now can go back

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.060
and we can attempt
to take these reads

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.891
and determine what the
underlying genotypes are

00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:03.640
for an individual.

00:50:06.419 --> 00:50:08.210
Now I want to be clear
about the difference

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:09.810
between a genotype
for an individual

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.310
and an allelic spectrum
for a population.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:15.820
A genotype for an
individual thinks

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.570
about both of the alleles
that that individual has,

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:20.830
and they can be phased
or unphased, right?

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:22.400
If they're phased,
it means you know

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.460
which allele belongs to mom and
which allele belongs to dad,

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.660
so to speak, right?

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:31.580
If they're unphased, you
simply know the number

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.360
of reference alleles that
you have in that individual.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.570
Typically, people think about
there being a reference allele

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:45.440
and an alternative allele,
which means that a genotype can

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.160
be expressed as
0, 1, or 2, which

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.680
is the number of
reference alleles

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:55.660
present at a particular base
if it's unphased, right?

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.270
0, 1, or 2-- 0 mean there are
no reference alleles there,

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.150
1 meaning that it's
a heterozygote,

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:05.920
2 mean there are two reference
alleles in that individual.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.692
OK?

00:51:07.692 --> 00:51:09.900
So there are different ways
of representing genotype,

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.610
but once again, it represents
the different allelic forms

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.440
of the two chromosomes.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.440
And whatever form you
choose, the probability

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.114
over those genotypes
has to sum to 1.

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.780
You can think about
the genotype ranging

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:31.930
over all the possible bases from
mom and from dad or over 0, 1,

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:32.465
and 2.

00:51:32.465 --> 00:51:34.590
Doesn't really matter,
depending upon which way you

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:37.970
want to simplify the problem.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:42.200
And what we would like to do
is, for a given population--

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.720
let's say cases
or controls-- we'd

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.870
like to compute the
probability over the genotypes

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:54.410
with high veracity, OK?

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:59.200
So in order to do
that, we'll start

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.330
by taking all the
reads for each one

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:05.025
of the individuals
in a population, OK?

00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:07.280
And we're going to compute
the genotype likelihoods

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.170
for each individual.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.880
So let's talk about
how to do that.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.740
Now everything I've written on
the board is on the next slide.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.760
The problem is, if I
put it on the slide,

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.800
it will flash in front
of you and you'll go,

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.059
yes, I understand that, I think.

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:25.725
This way, I'll put
it on the board first

00:52:25.725 --> 00:52:26.810
and you'll look at
it and you'll say,

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.765
hm, maybe I don't
understand that, I think.

00:52:28.765 --> 00:52:30.140
And then you'll
ask any questions

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.380
and we can look at the
slide in a moment, OK?

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:36.680
But here's the fundamental
idea, all right?

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.420
At a given base in the
genome, the probability

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.820
of the reads that we see based
upon the genotype that we think

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:48.550
is there can be expressed
in the following form, which

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:52.470
is that we take the product over
all the reads that we see, OK?

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:59.322
And the genotype is going to
be a composition of the base we

00:52:59.322 --> 00:53:01.280
get from mom and the base
that we get from dad,

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.480
or it could simply
be 0, 1, and 2.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.790
We'll put that
aside for a moment.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.850
So what's the chance that
we inherited something

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:16.260
from a particular base from mom?

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.590
It's this base over
a particular read.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.340
What's the chance
a particular read

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.030
came from mom's chromosome?

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.830
That's one half
times the probability

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:31.930
of the data given
the base that we see.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:33.840
And once again, since
it could be a coin

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.070
flip whether the read came
from mom or dad's chromosome,

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.710
divide it by 2-- the
probability of the data

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:43.555
that we see with dad's version
of that particular base.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:50.060
So once again, for
all the reads we're

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.120
going to compute the
probability of the read set

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.730
that we see given a particular
hypothesized genotype

00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:01.080
by looking at what's the
likelihood or the probability

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.427
of all those reads.

00:54:03.427 --> 00:54:05.010
And for each read,
we don't know if it

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.247
came from mom or from dad.

00:54:06.247 --> 00:54:08.580
But in any event, we're going
to compute the probability

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.680
on the next blackboard,
this bit right here.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.460
OK?

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.306
Yes?

00:54:15.306 --> 00:54:17.732
AUDIENCE: So if you assume
that mom and dad have

00:54:17.732 --> 00:54:23.547
a different phase at
a particular base,

00:54:23.547 --> 00:54:25.338
couldn't that possibly
skew the probability

00:54:25.338 --> 00:54:28.314
of getting a read from mom's
chromosome or dad's chromosome?

00:54:31.336 --> 00:54:33.434
PROFESSOR: A different phase?

00:54:33.434 --> 00:54:39.802
AUDIENCE: So the composition
of bases affect what you get.

00:54:39.802 --> 00:54:45.258
I think certain
base compositions

00:54:45.258 --> 00:54:48.250
are more likely to be
sequenced, for example.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:48.930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.910
AUDIENCE: Could that bias--

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:51.535
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:51.535 --> 00:54:54.720
In fact, that's why on,
I think, the third slide,

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.940
I said non-random genotyping
error was being excluded.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.292
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:54:59.292 --> 00:55:00.000
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.010
From our discussion today?

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.510
But you're right that it might
be that certain sequences are

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.240
more difficult to
see, but we're going

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.030
to exclude that
for the time being.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.220
OK?

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.010
So this is the
probability of the reads

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:17.320
that we see given a
hypothesized genotype.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.500
And I'll just show you,
that's very simple.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.390
That we have a read, let's
call the read D sub j,

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.770
and we have the base that
we think we should see.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:30.000
And if the base is correct,
then the probability

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.210
that that's correct is 1
minus the error, right,

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.090
that the machine reported.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:36.850
And if it isn't
correct, the probability

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:41.350
is just the error at that base
that the machine reported.

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:44.530
So we're using the error
statistics from the machine

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:48.892
and if it matches what we
expect, it's 1 minus the error.

00:55:48.892 --> 00:55:50.850
And if it doesn't match,
it's just simply going

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.590
to be the error
that's reported, OK?

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.567
So this is the probability of
seeing a particular read given

00:55:57.567 --> 00:55:59.275
a hypothesized base
that should be there.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:05.550
Here's how we use that, looking
at all the possible bases that

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.540
could be there given a
hypothesized genotype.

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.340
Remember, this genotype is
only going to be one pair.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.720
It's only going to be AA or
TT or what have you, right?

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.870
So it's going to be one pair.

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:21.170
So we're going to be testing
for either one or two bases

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:23.270
being present.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:29.060
And finally, we want to
compute the posterior

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:33.400
of the genotype given the
data we have observed, OK?

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.930
So we want to compute what's
the probability of the genotype

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:40.779
given the reads that
we have in our hand.

00:56:40.779 --> 00:56:41.820
This is really important.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:47.540
That is what that genotype
likelihood is up there.

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:51.377
It's the probability of the read
set given the genotype times

00:56:51.377 --> 00:56:52.960
the probability of
the genotype-- this

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.286
is a prior-- over the
probability of the data.

00:56:56.286 --> 00:56:57.410
This is simply Bayes' Rule.

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.390
So with this, for
an individual now,

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:07.150
we can compute the
posterior of the genotype

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:10.150
given the read set.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:12.270
Very simple concept.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:16.990
So in another form, you can
see the same thing here,

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.960
which is the Bayesian model.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.630
And we've talked about this
haploid likelihood function,

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:26.880
which was on the
blackboard I showed you.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.120
And we're assuming all
the reads are independent

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.170
and that they're
going to come equally

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:36.940
from mom and dad, more
or less, et cetera, OK?

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:43.050
And the haploid likelihood
function, once again,

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:47.410
just is using the error
statistics for the machine.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:50.525
So I'm asking if the
machine says this is an A

00:57:50.525 --> 00:57:54.900
and I think it's an A, then the
probability that that's correct

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.570
is 1 minus the error
of the machine.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.870
If the two are not
in agreement, it's

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:03.250
simply the error in the
machine that I'm using.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:08.700
So this allows me now to
give a posterior probability

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.320
of a genotype given a
whole bunch of reads.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:19.090
And the one part that
we haven't discussed

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:22.800
is this prior,
which is how do we

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.745
establish what we think is
going on in the population

00:58:25.745 --> 00:58:29.190
and how do we set that?

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.960
So if you look back
at the slide again,

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.820
you can see that we
have these individuals

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.920
and there's this magic step
on the right-hand side, which

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.440
is that somehow we're
going to compute

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.660
a joint estimate
across all the samples

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:46.000
to come up with an estimate
of what the genotypes are

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
in a particular SNP position.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.660
And the way that we can do
that is with an iterative EM

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:59.090
procedure-- looks
like this-- so we

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:06.840
can estimate the probability
of the population genotype

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:12.342
iteratively using this
equation until convergence.

00:59:12.342 --> 00:59:13.550
And there are various tricks.

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.610
As you'll see if you
want to delve further

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.930
into this in the
paper I posted, there

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:21.040
are ways to deal with some
of the numerical issues

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.290
and do allele count
frequencies and so forth.

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.860
But fundamentally,
in a population

00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.840
we're going to
estimate a probability

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.182
over the genotypes for
a particular position.

00:59:32.182 --> 00:59:33.640
And just to keep
it simple, you can

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.780
think about the
genotypes being 0, 1,

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.990
or 2-- 0, no reference
alleles present;

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:44.980
1, one reference allele present
to that site; 2, two reference

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:48.182
alleles present
to that site, OK?

00:59:48.182 --> 00:59:49.640
So we get a
probability of each one

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.520
of those states for
that population.

00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:00.760
Any questions at all about that?

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.280
The details or anything at all?

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:08.300
People get the general idea
that what we're just doing

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:12.900
is we're taking a bunch of
reads at a particular position

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.660
for an individual and
computing the posterior

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.070
probability of a genotype
seeing all of those reads

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:23.970
and then, when we think about
the entire population-- say

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:26.340
either the cases
or the controls--

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.000
we're computing the
probability over the genotypes

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.430
within that population
using this kind

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.614
of iterative procedure.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:44.710
OK, so going on then, if
we go back to our 0, 1,

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:47.260
2 kind of genotype
representation,

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:51.190
we can marginalize psi,
which is the probability

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:53.195
of the reference allele
being in the population,

01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.815
and 1 minus psi
being the probability

01:00:54.815 --> 01:00:58.280
of the non-reference allele,
where the capital alleles are

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.870
reference and the little
ones are non-reference.

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:05.870
And then we could also
for epsilon 0, epsilon 1,

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.540
And Epsilon 2, those
are the probabilities

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.820
of the various allelic
forms, the various genotypes.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.740
And actually, I think
epsilon 0 should be little A,

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.820
little A. Must have
got the two of them

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.740
flipped, but it's not
really that important.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:28.910
OK, so what do we know
about a population?

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.050
Who's heard about
Hardy-Weinberg before?

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:33.420
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.970
OK.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:38.210
So Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
says that, for example,

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.740
in a population, if the allelic
frequency of the reference

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.810
allele is psi, right, what's
the chance that an individual

01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:48.690
should be AA, big A, big
A, reference, reference?

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:54.980
In a population?

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.269
Pardon?

01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:58.060
I think I heard it.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.190
Psi squared, right?

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.640
We're going to assume
diploid organisms,

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.242
we're going to
assume random mating,

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.700
we're going to
assume no selection,

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.430
we're going to assume no
bottlenecks, and so forth,

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.110
right?

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:13.826
That over time, the population
will come to its equilibrium

01:02:13.826 --> 01:02:15.300
in the exchange of alleles.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.780
However, if there's
strong selection

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.460
or if part of the
population gets up and moves

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.030
to a different continent
or something of that sort,

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.920
you can get out of equilibrium.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.420
And so one question,
whenever you're

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.794
doing a genetic
study like this--

01:02:28.794 --> 01:02:31.320
is your population in
equilibrium or not?

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:37.570
And we have a direct way for
testing for that because we're

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:40.330
actually estimating
the genotypes, right?

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:44.670
So what we can do is this test.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:48.020
We can do a log likelihood
test directly, right?

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:52.060
And we can compare the
probability of the observed

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:58.090
genotypes-- these are E1 and
E2, where the number indicates

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:02.340
the number of reference
copies-- over the probability

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:08.090
of the genotypes being
composed directly

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:12.980
from the frequency of
the reference allele.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.160
And this will tell
us whether or not

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.330
these are concordant or not.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.410
And if the Chi-square
value is large enough,

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:26.750
we're going to say that this
divergence couldn't have

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:29.630
occurred at random and
therefore the population is not

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:30.255
in equilibrium.

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.570
And you might say,
well, gee, why

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:37.570
do I really care if it's
in equilibrium or not?

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:41.470
I mean, you know,
what relevance does

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:44.500
that have to me when
I'm doing my test?

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.710
Well, here's the issue.

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:51.410
The issue is this-- you're going
to be testing whether or not

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:55.290
genotypes are different
between a case and a control

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.170
population, let's say, OK?

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.670
And you have a couple
different tests you can do.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.780
The first test is
the test on the top

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.090
and the second test is
the test on the bottom.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:10.010
Let's look at the test on
the bottom for a moment, OK?

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:13.580
The test in the bottom
is saying you consider

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.630
the likelihood of
the data in group one

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:19.290
and group two
multiplied together

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:22.830
over the probability of the
data with the groups combined

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:31.430
and you ask whether or not the
increased likelihood-- you're

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:35.750
willing to pay for that given
the two degrees of freedom

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:39.120
that model implies, right?

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:47.790
Because you have to have two
additional degrees of freedom

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:50.300
to pay for that in the bottom.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.760
On the other hand,
in the top, you only

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.510
have one degree of
additional freedom

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:58.050
to pay for the difference in
simply the reference allele

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.047
frequency.

01:05:00.047 --> 01:05:01.630
And so these are two
different metrics

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.780
you can use to test
for associations

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.180
for a particular SNP in two
different case and control

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.200
populations.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.290
The problem comes is that if the
population is in equilibrium,

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:19.210
then the bottom has too many
degrees of freedom, right?

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.630
Because the bottom,
in some sense,

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.570
can be computed
directly from the top.

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.820
You can compute the epsilons
directly from the size

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.420
if it's in equilibrium.

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.050
So you need to
know whether or not

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.550
you're in equilibrium or not
to figure out what kind of test

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:35.705
to use to see whether or not a
particular SNP is significant.

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:44.130
OK, so just a brief review where
we've come to at this point.

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.220
I've handed you a
basket of reads.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:49.650
We're focusing on a particular
location in the genome.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.220
For an individual, we can
look at that basket of reads

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.220
and compute a posterior
probability of the genotype

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.630
at that location.

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.890
We then asked if we take
all of the individuals

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:04.760
in a given interesting
population, like the cases,

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.000
we could compute the
posterior or the probability

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.160
of the genotype over
all those cases.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.910
We then can take the
cases and the controls

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:19.860
and test for associations using
this likelihood ratio, OK?

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:26.790
So that is the way to go
at the question of SNPs.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:29.470
And I'll pause here
and see if there

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.839
any other questions about this.

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:38.680
OK, now there are
lots of other ways

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.640
of approaching
structural variation.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.080
I said I would touch upon it.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.320
There is another
method which is--

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.030
we've not been here assigning
what haplotypes to things

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:55.900
or paying attention to
which chromosome or mom

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.420
or dad a particularly
allele came from.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.150
But suffice to
say-- I'll let you

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.330
read this slide
at your leisure--

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:06.950
the key thing is that, imagine
you have a bunch of reads.

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:08.730
What you can do in
a particular area

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.230
there's going to
be a variant is you

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.080
can do local assembly
of the reads.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.580
We want to do local assembly
because local assembly handles

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.340
general cases of
structural variation.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.490
And if you then take
the most likely cases

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:28.360
of the local assembly
supported by reads,

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.060
you have the different possible
haplotypes or collections

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.180
of bases along the
genome from the assembly.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.330
And we've already talked
about, earlier in class,

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:44.190
how to take a given
sequence of bases

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.300
and estimate the probability
of the divergence

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.610
from another string.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.510
So you can estimate
the divergence

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:53.180
of each one of those
assemblies from the reference

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:56.230
and compute likelihoods, like
we did before for single bases,

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:59.190
although it's
somewhat more complex.

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:01.060
And so another way
to approach this

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.910
is, instead of asking
about individual bases

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:08.240
and looking at the likelihood
of individual bases,

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.140
you can look at doing
localized assembly of the reads

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.570
that handle
structural variation.

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:23.050
And if you do that,
what happens is

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:29.920
that you can recover
INDEL issues that

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:38.529
appear to call SNP variants that
actually are actually induced

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:44.410
by insertions and deletions
in one of the chromosomes.

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:50.510
So as you can see, as things
get more sophisticated

01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:52.779
in the analysis of
human genome data,

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.720
one needs a variety
of techniques,

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.830
including local assembly,
to be able to recover

01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:58.500
what's going on.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.229
Because of course,
the reference genome

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:02.680
is only an approximate
idea of what's

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.640
there and is being
used as a scaffold.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:13.649
So we've already talked
about the idea of phasing,

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.790
and we talked about why phasing
is important, especially

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:22.479
when we're trying to
recover whether or not

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:24.750
you have a loss of
function event, right?

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:28.819
And so the phasing
part of genomics

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:32.529
right now is highly
heuristic, relies partly

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:37.090
upon empirical data from
things like the HapMap Project

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.090
and is outside the
scope of what we're

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:40.840
going to talk about,
because we could talk

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.529
about phasing for
an entire lecture.

01:09:42.529 --> 01:09:44.880
But suffice it to
say, it's important.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.300
And if you look at
what actually goes on,

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.770
here's a trio, mom,
dad, and the daughter.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.990
You can see down at the
bottom, you see mom's reads.

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.340
And you see dad actually
has two haplotypes.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.210
He got one haplotype
from one of his parents

01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:02.580
and the other haplotype
from both of his parents.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:09.410
And then the daughter actually
has the haplotype number one

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:13.510
from dad and no haplotype
number one from mom.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:17.500
So you can see how these
blocks of mutations

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:24.400
are inherited through the
generation in this form.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:31.740
And finally, if you
look at a VCF file,

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.140
if you see a
vertical bar, that's

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:43.410
telling you that the
chromosomal origin is fixed.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.890
So it tells you, for
example, in this case,

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:47.390
the one where the
arrow's pointed to

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:49.680
is that variant
number one, which

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.680
is the alternative
variant T came from mom

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.120
and a T came from dad.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.370
So VCF, when it has
slashes between the two

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:05.190
different alleles of a
genotype is unphased,

01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:08.100
but you can actually have
a phased VCF version.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.500
And so there's a whole
phase in the GATK tool kit

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.380
that does phasing.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:18.390
And finally, we get
through all this,

01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:21.970
the question is how important
are the variants you discover?

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:24.970
And so there's a
variant analysis phase

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:28.160
and it will go through and
annotate all the variants.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.410
For example, this is a
splice site acceptor variant

01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:36.120
which is in a
protein coating gene

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.240
and it's thought
to be important.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.110
And so at the end
of this pipeline,

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.693
what's going to
happen is you're going

01:11:42.693 --> 01:11:46.090
to be spitting out not
only the variants but,

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:48.960
for some of them, what
their annotated function is.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.500
OK, so that ends the
part of our lecture

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.840
where we're talking about
how to process raw read data.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.922
And I encourage you to look
at the GATK and other websites

01:12:03.922 --> 01:12:05.630
to actually look at
the state of the art.

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:11.000
But as you can see, it's
an evolving discipline

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.170
that has a kernel of principal
probabilistic analysis in part

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:22.749
of its core surrounded by
a whole lot of baling wire,

01:12:22.749 --> 01:12:24.040
right, to hold it all together.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.870
And you get the
reads marshalled,

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:31.510
organized, compressed,
aligned properly, phased,

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:36.000
and so forth, OK?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.830
Let's talk now about how
to prioritize variants.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:44.160
And I just wanted to show you
a very beautiful result that

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.620
is represented by this paper,
which came out very recently.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:54.990
And here is a portion
of the genome.

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:59.090
And we're looking
here at-- you see

01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:06.470
here-- a pancreatic disorder.

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:09.340
And there is an enhancer
on the right-hand side

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.180
of the screen where that
little red square is.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:16.860
And recall that we said that
certain histone marks were

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.340
present typically
over active enhancers.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:23.090
And so you can see the
H3K4 mono-methyl mark being

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:25.030
present over that little
red box as well as

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:30.380
the binding of two pancreatic
regulators, FoxA2 and Pdx1.

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.672
And within that
enhancer you can see

01:13:32.672 --> 01:13:34.630
there are a whole lot of
variants being called.

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:35.390
Well, not a whole lot.

01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:36.690
There are actually
five different variants

01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:37.430
being called.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:41.260
And in addition to those
five specific SNP variants,

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.490
there's also another
variation that was observed

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:47.100
in the population of a 7.6-kb
deletion right around that

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.140
enhancer.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:55.410
And if you look at the
inheritance of those mutations

01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:58.110
with disease
prevalence, you can see

01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:01.415
that there's a very
marked correlation.

01:14:01.415 --> 01:14:06.070
That when you inherit
these variants,

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:09.450
you get this Mendelian disorder.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:11.170
So it's a single
gene disorder really.

01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:20.270
And in order to confirm this,
what the authors of this study

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:23.980
did was they took
that enhancer and they

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.740
looked at all the different
SNPs and they mutated it.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.860
And in the upper
left-hand corner,

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:36.230
you can see that the five little
asterisks note the decrease

01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:42.160
in activity of that
enhancer when they mutated

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.440
the bases indicated
at SNP positions.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.760
The three C's on the
panel on the right

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.370
with the y-axis being
relative interaction

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.280
shows that that
enhancer is interacting

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.290
with the promoter of that gene.

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.880
And they further
elucidated the motifs

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.240
that were being interacted with
and the little arrows point

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.680
to where the mutations
in those motifs occur.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.180
So they've gone
from an association

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:16.540
with that particular disease
to the actual functional

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:19.760
characterization
of what's going on.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.380
I'll leave you with a final
thought to think about.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:25.587
This is the thing
that caused the brawls

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.920
in the bars I told you about
at the beginning of today's

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.700
lecture.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.920
Let's suppose you look
at identical twins,

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.270
monozygotic twins, and you
ask the following question.

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.050
You say, OK, in
monozygotic twins,

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:43.180
the prevalence of a particular
disease is a 30% correlative.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.860
That is, if one individual
in a twin has the disease,

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.300
there's a 30% chance that the
other twin's going to get it.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.940
Now there are two
possibilities here,

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:56.504
which is that for
all pairs of twins,

01:15:56.504 --> 01:15:58.670
there's a very low risk
that you're going to get it,

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:03.150
or that there are some
subset of genotypes where

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:07.180
if one twin has it, the other
one's always going to get it.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.320
So the author of the
study actually looked

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.110
at a block of identical twin
data and asked two questions.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:17.960
The first was if you look at
the percentage of cases that

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:23.020
would test positive, making
no assumptions about genotype,

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.929
using twin data, you
can see the percentage

01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:27.720
of people that actually
have a disease that

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.000
will test positive
is actually fairly

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.320
low for a wide
variety of diseases.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.210
All these diseases were
studied in the context

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:38.410
of identical twins.

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:43.560
And this suggested to
them that, in fact,

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.500
personal genomic
sequencing might not

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.540
be as predictive
as one might like.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:54.690
That is, if you have a disease,
for over half of these,

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:58.260
the test will not be positive.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:02.170
And furthermore, if you test
negative for the disease,

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:03.990
your relative risk--
that is, the chance

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:06.590
you're going to get this
disease to the chance you get it

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:11.950
at random in the population--
is not really reduced that much.

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:15.960
And so, since this study
relied solely on twin data

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.150
and didn't make any
other assumptions,

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:22.610
it raised the question in
the field of to what extent

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:26.070
is personal genome sequencing
going to be really helpful?

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:28.410
So on that note, we've
talked a lot today

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:32.440
about the analysis of
human genetic variation.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.980
I hope you've enjoyed it.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.457
Once again, on Thursday
we have Ron Weiss coming.

01:17:38.457 --> 01:17:39.290
Thank you very much.

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:42.432
This concludes lecture 20 of the
formal material in the course

01:17:42.432 --> 01:17:43.640
and we'll see you in lecture.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.790
Thank you very much.

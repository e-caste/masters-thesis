00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.260
When we discuss the
rolling of the wheel,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.980
we chose a reference
frame fixed to the ground.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:19.090
So that was what we called frame
A. And in that reference frame,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.060
the motion of the point P on
the rim was quite complicated.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.450
Now what we'd like to look at
it in the reference frame moving

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.650
with the center of mass.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.810
And we call that frame cm.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.240
Now the picture
there is much easier

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.350
because the object is--
in that reference frame,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.750
the center of mass
is not moving.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.150
And the point P on
the rim, the object

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.740
is just undergoing
circular motion.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.640
So in that frame, the
velocity of that point P

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.750
in the center of mass frame
is just tangent to the circle.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.630
And as the object moves
around, at a later time,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.660
the velocity is
always tangential.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
And in this reference frame,
it's just pure circular motion.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.970
And we know that the speed
in that reference frame

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.245
is given by the radius of the
wheel times the rate d phi

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.920
to dt.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.250
And here let's define the
variable theta this way.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.180
And so, in this frame
what's happening

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.590
is pure circular motion.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.370
Now we know our law of
addition of velocity

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.910
tells us that the velocity
in the frame fixed

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.710
to the ground of that point
is equal to the velocity

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.630
of the center of mass
plus the velocity

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.800
of the object, the
point on the run

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.220
in the center of mass frame.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.410
Now what we want
to do now is draw

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.010
a picture which illustrates this
law of addition of velocities.

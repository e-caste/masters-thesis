00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:25.625
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Talking
about students at MIT.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.360
So some of you are
graduating soon,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.795
and this might be
your last chance

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.297
to ask Noam Chomsky a question.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.199
So anyone who hasn't
spoken yet would

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:40.893
like to ask a question
before you graduate?

00:00:40.893 --> 00:00:43.309
AUDIENCE: We've talked in this
class a bit about silencing

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.313
and how that kind of leads
into the whole system.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.950
Sorry, I can speak up.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.685
So we've talked about silencing.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.520
NOAM CHOMSKY: About?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.220
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Silencing.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.220
NOAM CHOMSKY: Silencing.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.423
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:03.546
And how stories are hidden, like
you talked about-- what can we

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:04.650
do about that?

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.899
NOAM CHOMSKY: About silencing?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.482
AUDIENCE: What
measurable steps can we

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.836
take towards
uncovering the stories

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:15.041
and actually making
change happen?

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:19.312
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, what you
do about silencing is speak up.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:22.615
We have a lot of
freedom if we use it.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:27.720
In fact, a lot more
than in the past.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.789
Take the last thing I mentioned.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.894
For women, the opportunity is
to speak up and become active

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:40.667
and have an impact is way beyond
what it was, say, 50 years ago.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:46.806
In fact, I was talking to
Michel about this before.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.975
I got a ton of email.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.811
And a lot of it is
from young people.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.848
And one question that keeps
coming up over and over

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.916
again is, everything's awful.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.585
What can we do?

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:03.056
But if you look closely
over many years,

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.226
I've noticed that the
kinds of questions you get

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.662
depend on where the
people are coming from.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.665
So if people are
coming from-- say

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:17.971
when I go down to give talks
in immigrant slums in South

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.207
Boston, nobody ever
asks what they can do.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.409
They tell me what they're doing.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.414
When I go to a remote
village in Southern Colombia

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:32.184
where people are being murdered
by paramilitaries and there's

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:36.656
a chemical company trying to--
a gold mining company trying

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.625
to destroy the water supply.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.426
They don't ask me,
what should they do?

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.762
They tell me what they're doing.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.231
When people are
privileged and have

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.370
every opportunity in front of
them, they ask, what can we do?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.540
And the fact is almost anything.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.242
There's all sorts of
opportunities open.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.278
Way more than there
were in the past

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:03.283
because we do enjoy the legacy
of people who have struggled

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.286
in the past under much
harsher conditions

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:11.324
and have provided us with the
opportunities we now have.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:16.080
Like, say, the opportunities
to be a student at MIT.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.996
That's an opportunity.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.965
It gives you all
sorts of things.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.368
It was closed to half the
population 50 years ago.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:28.107
It was closed, of course, to
minorities almost entirely.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:36.082
Well, it just illustrates what's
gone on all over the society.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:40.520
I mean, take, say,
the Sanders campaign,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.858
which I think was the most
important aspect of the 2016

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:49.829
election, by far.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.966
Out of that, there are groups
developing that are really

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.466
trying to do things.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.869
You can be part of that.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.405
Make new ones.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.941
All sorts of opportunities.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:05.044
And I think the
prospects for the future

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:10.049
are not too bad when you think
of people's actual attitudes.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.218
And the way those
attitudes could

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:17.624
be melded into activist and
political and other programs

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.627
to bring about
changes in society.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:27.834
So I don't think there's a
real shortage of opportunity.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:32.472
I mean, there are all sorts
of efforts to atomize people,

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.040
keep you alone.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.343
That's one of the functions
of social media incidentally.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:41.271
You sit alone with--
whatever it is-- your device

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:46.252
and you think you have friends
in Indonesia and so on.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:51.924
But you're really separated
from the people around you.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:56.262
Atomization is a very important
way of controlling people,

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.499
because you can only do
things if you work together.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.403
So when you're all
separated, that's great.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:07.607
Then, those who really run
things, they do get together.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:13.079
They don't sit around
looking at iPads, and so on.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.214
So you can keep the population--

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.185
In fact, that's one of the main
things consumerism is about.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:22.455
You take a look at the history
of the advertising industry.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.457
It's quite interesting.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.960
The huge advertising and
public relations industry

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.064
developed in the freest
countries in the world,

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.600
in Britain and the United
States about a century ago.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.569
And the reason was pretty clear.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.504
It was often stated.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.307
People had won enough
freedom, so that you

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.976
couldn't control them by force.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.412
So you had to control
them in other ways.

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.281
And the best way
of controlling them

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:53.953
is what was called
convincing them

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:58.124
to be concerned with the
superficial things of life,

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.993
like consumption.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:06.432
So if you can get
to a stage where--

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.401
thinking of my granddaughter.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:12.238
Teenage girls on a
Saturday afternoon.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:15.308
The best thing they can think of
doing is walking through a mall

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:20.012
and looking at things
they can't buy.

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.981
That's great.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.751
When you get to a
society like that,

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.353
you've got people under control.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:30.289
And there's some
pretty obvious things

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.360
that are never discussed,
like you've all

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.897
heard 10 million times about
the wonders of free market

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.565
societies.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.436
But almost no one tells
you that the business world

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:46.172
hates free market society.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.442
And in fact, they spend hundreds
of billion dollars a year

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.644
to undermine markets.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.347
It's called advertising.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:57.550
Anyone who has studied
economics knows

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.479
that markets-- the
marvels of markets

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.091
are based on informed consumers
making rational choices.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.094
Then, you study the mathematics
and you make up the models,

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:08.995
and so on.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.097
Take a look at the real world.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:15.268
Hundreds of billions of
dollars are spent every year

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:20.573
to ensure that uninformed
people make irrational choices.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:23.042
It's called advertising.

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.445
If you had a market society.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:30.016
If, say, Ford Motor
Company has cars to sell,

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.652
what they would do is say,
here are the characteristics

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.587
of our cars.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:37.056
Small ad on television.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.224
Here's the characteristics.

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:41.327
Here's what Consumer
Reports says about it.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.795
That's not what they do.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.465
What they do is try
to create illusions,

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:50.102
so you will be uninformed and
make an irrational choice.

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.205
In fact, while the
economics department

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:55.174
is talking about
rational choice models

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:57.443
and so on, with
informed consumers,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:01.314
the business world is trying
to make sure it doesn't happen.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.417
Of course, that's the
thing that has the effect.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:07.086
Speaking of silencing,
how much do you

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:10.256
hear about this in
economics courses?

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.926
Or in the general discussion?

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:14.560
It's not deep.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.394
It's not profound.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.696
It's not quantum physics.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:17.997
We all know it.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.200
It's right in front of our
eyes, but it's kept silent.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.870
And those are the kind of things
you have to break through with.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.538
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Thank
you so much, Noam.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:28.022
That was wonderful. [applause]

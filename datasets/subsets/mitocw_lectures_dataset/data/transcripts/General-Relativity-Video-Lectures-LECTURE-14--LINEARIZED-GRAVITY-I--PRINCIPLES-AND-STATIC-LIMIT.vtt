SCOTT HUGHES: All right, so
in today's recorded lecture,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.260
I would like to pick
up where we started--

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.760
excuse me.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.400
I'd like to pick up where
we stopped last time.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.660
So I discussed the
Einstein field equations

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.010
in the previous two lectures.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.520
I derived them first
from the method

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.910
that was used by Einstein in his
original work on the subject.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.960
And then I laid out the way of
coming to the Einstein field

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.940
equations using an
action principle,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.360
using what we call the
Einstein Hilbert action.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.920
Both of them lead us to this
remarkably simple equation,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.730
if you think about it in terms
simply of the curvature tensor.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.860
This is saying that a particular
version of the curvature.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.470
You start with the
Riemann tensor.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.600
You trace over two indices.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.620
You reverse the trace
such that this whole thing

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.760
has zero divergence.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.630
And you simply equate that
to the stress energy tensor

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.380
with a coupling factor
with a complex constant

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.120
proportionality that
ensures that this

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.430
recovers the Newtonian limit.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.950
The Einstein Hilbert
exercise demonstrated

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.270
that this is in a very
quantifiable way, the simplest

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.420
possible way of developing
a theory of gravity

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.528
in this framework.

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.070
The remainder of
this course is going

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.780
to be dedicated to
solving this equation,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.000
and exploring the properties
of the solutions that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.578
arise from this.

00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:44.120
And so let me continue
the discussion

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.000
I began at the end of
the previous lecture.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120
We are going to
find it very useful

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:08.740
to regard this as a set
of differential equations

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.090
for the spacetime
metric given a source.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.080
That, after all,
is how we typically

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.080
think of solving for fields
given a particular source.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080
And just pardon me while
I make sure this is on.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.600
It is.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.190
I give you a
distribution of mass.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.350
You compute the Newtonian
gravitational potential

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.850
for that.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.650
I give you a distribution
of currents and fields.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.720
You calculate the electric
and magnetic fields

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.100
that arise from that.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.220
So I give you some distribution
of mass and energy.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.820
You compute the spacetime
that arises from that.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.690
But let's stop before
we dig into this,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.940
and look at what
this actually means

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.460
given the mathematical
equations that we have.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.310
So G alpha beta is
the Einstein tensor.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.060
I construct it by taking several
derivatives of the metric.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.770
I first make my
Christoffel symbols.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.900
I combine those Christoffel
symbols and derivatives

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.600
of the Christoffel symbols
to make the Riemann tensor.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.550
I hit it with another
power of the metric

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.157
in order to trace and
get the Ricci tensor.

00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:18.740
I combine it with the trace of
the Ricci tensor and the metric

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.270
to get the Einstein.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.800
Schematically, I can
think of G alpha beta

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.420
as some very
complicated linear--

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.600
excuse me, some very complicated
nonlinear differential

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.640
operator acting on the metric.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.760
So thinking about this is
just a differential equation

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.750
for the metric.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.360
The left hand side of this
equation is a bit of a mess.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.680
Unfortunately, the right
hand side can be a mess too.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680
Let's think about this
for a particular example.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.430
Suppose I choose as my force--

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.780
my source-- a perfect fluid.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.653
Well, then my right
hand side is going

00:04:27.653 --> 00:04:30.070
to be something that involves
the density and the pressure

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:41.060
of that fluid, the fluid
velocity, and then the metric.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.460
OK, so if I'm thinking
about this as a differential

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.860
equation for the
metric, the metric

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.080
is appearing under this
differential operator

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.030
on the left hand
side, and explicitly

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.980
in the source on
the right hand side.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.710
Oh, and by the way, don't
forget my fluid needs

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.490
to be normalized.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.040
My fluid flow velocity
needs to be normalized.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.560
So I have a further constraint,
that the complement to the four

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.370
velocity are related to each
other by the spacetime metric.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.390
So if I am going to regard this
as just a differential equation

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.040
for the space time metric.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.840
In general, we're in
for a world of pain.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.720
So as I described at the
end of the previous lecture,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.370
we are going to examine
how to solve this equation.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.650
In what's left of
8.962, we're going

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.850
to look at three routes
to solving this thing.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.300
The one that we will
begin to talk about today

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.280
is we solve this for what I
will define a little bit more

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.125
precisely in a moment
as weak gravity.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.670
And what this is going
to mean is that I only

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:05.320
consider space times that are
in a way that can be quantified

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.480
close to flat space time.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.350
Method two will be to
consider symmetric solutions.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.210
Part of the reason the general
framework is so complicated

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.330
is that there are in
general, 10 of these

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.850
coupled non-linear
differential equations.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.530
When we introduce
symmetries, or we

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.950
consider things like
static solutions

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.730
or stationary solutions that
don't have any time dynamics.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.742
That at least reduces
the number of equations

00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:44.700
we need to worry about.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.590
They may still be coupled
non-linear and complicated,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.428
but hopefully,
maybe we can reduce

00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:52.970
those from 10 of
these things we need

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.280
to worry about to just a small
number them, one, or two,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.350
or three.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.390
Makes it at least
a little easier.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.340
In truth, symmetric solutions--

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:13.310
if you can then add techniques
for perturbing around them,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.280
these turn out to be
tremendously powerful.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.210
My own research career is--

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.370
uses this technique
a tremendous amount.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.713
Finally, just basically
say, you know what?

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:35.380
Let's just dive in
and solve this puppy.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.900
Just do a numerical solution
of the whole monster,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.482
no simplifications.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.030
Eminent members of our field
have dedicated entire careers

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.920
to item three.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.260
I will give you an introduction
to the main concepts

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.660
in the last lecture.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.240
But it's not
something we're going

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.210
to be able to explore in
much detail in this class.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.403
We're going to do one in
a fair amount of detail.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:15.320
We will look at a couple
of the most important

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.820
symmetric solutions,
so that you can

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.315
see how these techniques work.

00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:22.690
And then in my
last two lectures,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.020
I'm going to describe
a little bit about what

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.252
happens when you perturb
some of the most interesting

00:08:26.252 --> 00:08:27.085
symmetric solutions.

00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:33.970
And we'll talk about numerical
solutions for the general case.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.850
All right, so let's begin.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.370
We'll begin with choice one.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:44.900
Look at weak gravity,
also known as

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.156
linearized general relativity.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.550
So linearized general
relativity is a situation

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.100
in which we are only going
to consider space times that

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.360
are nearly flat.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:28.250
If I am in this situation,
then I can choose coordinates,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:37.890
such that my space time metric
is the metric of flat space

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:49.120
time plus a tensor H-alpha
beta, all of whose components--

00:09:52.338 --> 00:09:54.380
so this notation that I'm
sort of inventing here,

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.320
double bars around H-alpha beta.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:07.830
This means the magnitude of
H-alpha beta's components.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.770
These all must be much,
much less than one.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.190
When you are in such
a coordinate system

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:28.070
you are in what we call
nearly Lorenz coordinates.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.110
Such a coordinate
system is as close

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.510
to a globally inertial
coordinate system

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.610
as is possible to make.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.660
There are other coordinate
choices we could make.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.050
So for instance, you're
working in a system like that.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.000
This basically boils
down to coordinates

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.320
that are Cartesian like
on their spatial slices.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.240
You could work in other ones.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.740
These are particularly
convenient.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.680
Because for instance, if I work
in a coordinate system whose

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.145
spatial sector is
spherical like,

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:07.270
well, then there's going
to be some components that

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:12.940
grow very large as I go to
large radius away from some--

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.280
the source of my gravitation.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.730
And this just makes my
analysis quite convenient.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.180
In particular, where I'm going
to take advantage of this.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.400
Whenever I come
across a term that

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:38.420
involves the perturbations
squared or to a higher power,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.040
I'm just going
approximate it as zero.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.850
I will always neglect
terms beyond linear,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:53.510
hence the term linearized
GR, in my analysis.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.630
Now, there are a
couple of properties,

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:14.030
before I get into how to develop
weak gravity, linearized GR.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.390
I want to discuss a little
bit some of the properties

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:22.100
of spacetimes of this form.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.710
What are the particularly
important properties of these?

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.269
So let's consider
coordinate transformations.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.870
My space time metric is
a tensor, like any other.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:00.300
And so the usual rules pertain
here, that I can change my

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:09.360
coordinates using
some matrix that

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.670
relates my original
coordinate system, which

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:17.770
I've denoted without bars, to
some new coordinate system that

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.280
is barred.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:29.400
Now, recall that when we
worked in flat space time,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.190
there was one category of
coordinate transformations

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.540
that was special.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.834
Those were the Lorentz
transformations.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.110
So we are not working
in flat space time.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.640
So on the face of it, we don't
expect Lorentz transformations

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.140
to play a particularly
special role,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.260
except perhaps in the domain
of a freely falling frame.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.210
But you know what?

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.310
This is a nearly flat space
time, so just for giggles,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.210
let's see what happens
if you apply the Lorentz

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.716
transformation to your
nearly flat spacetime.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:05.510
So if I look at G mu
bar nu bar as being

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:20.740
a Lorentz transformation applied
to my nearly flat metric.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:39.493
Well, what I get
[INAUDIBLE] side is this.

00:15:39.493 --> 00:15:41.910
Now, one of the reasons why
the Lorentz transformation was

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.820
special in flat
spacetime is that it

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.740
leaves the metric of
flat spacetime unchanged.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:57.480
And so this just
maps to eta mu nu.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.850
I'm going to define what
comes out here as h mu nu.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.030
I'm doing this in a fairly,
I hope, obvious way.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.860
This is interesting.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:31.040
What this has told me is
that when I apply the Lorentz

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.600
transformation to my
nearly flat space time,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.330
the background is unchanged.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.750
And the perturbation
to the background

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.260
transforms just like
any tensor field

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.900
would transform in flat space.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.270
Now, it should be emphasized, we
are not working in flat space.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.620
We can compute
curvature tensors.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.869
If we parallel transport--

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.410
If we consider two geodesics
moving through the space time,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.150
we will see that parallel
transport along those two

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
geodesics, if they start
out initially parallel,

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.900
they do not remain parallel.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.630
So this is not flat space time.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.040
But in many ways,
it's close enough

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.579
that we can borrow many of
the mathematical tools that

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.220
were used in flat space time.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.910
In particular, we can
introduce the following.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:39.990
Think of it as a
useful fiction, which

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:48.200
is that in this
framework, we can regard

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.260
the perturbation that
pushes us away from flat

00:17:51.260 --> 00:18:04.090
spacetime as just an
ordinary tensor field

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.700
living in the manifold
of special relativity,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.160
living in the eta
alpha beta metric.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.990
It's worth bearing in mind in
a fundamental sense, it's not.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.910
Space time is curved.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.240
h alpha beta is telling
me about that curvature.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.700
But the mathematics
works in such a way

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.380
that you can borrow
a lot of tools

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.880
that we used in
special relativity.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.490
And just imagine h
as a tensor field

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.760
living in that special
relativity manifold.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.430
OK, so that's useful
fact one that we

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:51.470
want to bear in mind as we work
in this nearly flat space time.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:57.600
Useful fact two is
we want to think

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.980
about what happens when we
raise and lower indices.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.630
So suppose now that
I'm going to regard

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.940
h alpha beta as
an ordinary tensor

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.040
field living in this thing.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.470
I might want to
know what it looks

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.145
like with its indices raised.

00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:28.520
So I'm going to
do what I usually

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.478
do when I want to raise
the indices on a tensor.

00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:34.520
I hit it with the metric.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.480
We're going to talk about
what my upstairs metric looks

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.590
like in just a moment.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.360
But clearly, it's
going to be something

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.440
that looks like the metric
of flat space time plus terms

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.600
that are on the order of h.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.420
Because I always drop terms
of order h squared and higher,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:03.210
I can immediately say
that this must simply

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:10.410
be the metric of flat
space time with the indices

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.260
in the upstairs
position acting on h.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:20.270
In other words,
at least when I am

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.830
acting on tensors that are
built from the space time

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:40.440
metric itself, I'm
going to always want

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:56.550
to raise and lower them using
my flat space time, eta alpha

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.870
beta.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.780
Bearing this in
mind, let's carefully

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.750
think about what the metric
inverse actually looks like.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.550
I actually used this in
one of my calculations

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.820
in the previous lecture.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.935
And I said, I'm going to justify
this in the next lecture.

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:20.560
So here we are.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.850
Now we're going to justify it.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.346
So let's use this definition.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.700
So the upstairs
metric is defined such

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.160
that when it contracts
with the downstairs metric,

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.810
I get the identity back.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:46.590
This is the definition
of the metric inverse.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.320
Working in linear theory,
I know that this thing

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.910
is going to be something
like eta alpha beta

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.450
plus a term of order h.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.700
I don't know what that
term is yet, so let me just

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.990
give it a new name.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:06.406
I'm going to call
it m alpha beta.

00:22:06.406 --> 00:22:06.906
Whoops.

00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:21.830
Hopefully, the math
will soon show me

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.110
what this m actually is.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.335
It will be of order h,
but as of yet, unknown.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.432
OK, so you know what?

00:22:57.432 --> 00:22:58.640
Let's rewrite that over here.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.320
So let's now multiply
this guy out.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.340
Eta alpha beta hitting
eta beta gamma.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.860
That gives me delta alpha gamma.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.770
m hitting eta.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.660
Now, remember what I
just said over here.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.160
When I'm working with
spacetime tensors,

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.240
I always raise and lower
indices using eta alpha beta.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.500
So when m alpha beta
hits eta beta gamma,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.600
this is going to give
me m alpha gamma.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.860
This eta hits that h.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:53.520
I get h, alpha upstairs,
gamma downstairs.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.120
And then this guy is of order
h, that guy is of order h.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.940
So additional terms
of order h squared.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.860
So these guys cancel.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:11.690
And what I am left
with is m alpha gamma

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.940
equals negative h alpha gamma.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.400
I can raise my two indices,
raise the gammas on both sides

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.900
here.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:26.060
And we deduce from this
that my inverse metric

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.220
is eta alpha beta
in the upstairs

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.290
position, minus h alpha beta.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.940
At least two linear order in h.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.490
I'll just comment
that what this is--

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.730
essentially, the matrix
or tensor equivalent

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.130
of a binomial expansion.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.450
1 over 1 plus epsilon is
approximately 1 minus epsilon.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.390
That's all this is.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.380
But this is important to do.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.940
In fact, I will just sort of
remark somewhat anecdotally

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.640
that when I work with
graduate students on projects,

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.710
where we have to do things
in linearized theory,

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.410
getting a sign wrong here is
one of the most common mistakes

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.100
that people make.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.390
All right, one final detail.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.170
So this detail, as
I just labeled it,

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.100
is a particularly important one.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.815
We talked about general
coordinate transformations.

00:25:55.815 --> 00:25:57.790
And I immediately went
in to discuss a Lorentz

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.500
transformation.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.040
There's a different category
of coordinate transformation

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:10.270
that plays a very important
role in understanding

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.893
the physics of systems that we
analyze in linearized theory.

00:26:13.893 --> 00:26:15.310
So let's consider
a different kind

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.900
of coordinate transformation.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:27.790
Let's consider a
coordinate shift,

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:36.130
which I'm going to
define by x alpha prime.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.930
Really, they should
be x prime alpha,

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.080
but you'll see why I need to
name it this way right now.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.330
So this is my original
coordinate, x alpha,

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:52.490
plus some little offset that's
a function of the coordinates x

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.240
beta.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.740
So think of this as suppose
I have a coordinate grid that

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.550
looks like this.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.340
And I have some
function that says,

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.830
I want to consider a different
system of coordinates that

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:14.150
maybe pushes me a little bit
along away from each of these

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.848
coordinate lines in
a way that varies

00:27:16.848 --> 00:27:18.140
as a function of position here.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.230
This notation is kind of
an abuse of the indices.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.820
I am really not trying to
define a coordinate invariant

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.720
relationship here.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.360
I am just trying to
connect two quantities,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.670
and I'm trying to
connect quantities in two

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.080
specific coordinate systems.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.220
And as we'll see, even
though this is a bit ugly.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.005
It works well for
what we want to do.

00:27:44.005 --> 00:27:45.630
So my coordinate
transformation matrix.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.760
OK, so I just take
the matrix of--

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.410
I developed the
Jacobian-- my matrix

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.410
of partial derivatives--
of the new coordinate

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.350
with respect to the old
coordinate in the usual way.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.530
This is going to
be my first term.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.578
It's just a Kronecker delta.

00:28:20.578 --> 00:28:22.120
And then I'm going
to get a term that

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:28.450
looks like matrix of
derivatives of the function that

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.692
defines my infinitesimal--
defines my shift.

00:28:31.692 --> 00:28:33.400
I just gave away what
I was about to say.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.190
I'm going to require [in?] my
work in these nearly Lorentz

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.190
coordinates, all of these
entries need to be small.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.750
These will all be
much, much less than 1.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.520
And so we call this
an infinitesimal

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.635
coordinate transformation.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.980
We are going to need to use
the inverse of this guy.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.000
And using the definition
of the inverse of this,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.580
saying essentially that when
I take this, and I contract--

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.680
Let me put it this way.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.450
I'll just write it out.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:40.210
So if I compute this.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.860
I get my Kronecker delta back.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.250
Taking advantage
of the smallness

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.860
of the transformation.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:30:07.560
It's not terribly hard
to demonstrate that

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.570
what comes out of it is this.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.720
The minus sign is the key thing
which I want to emphasize here.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.420
That minus sign is very
similar to the minus sign

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.218
that I have here.

00:30:25.218 --> 00:30:26.760
What we're doing
is, again, just kind

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.870
of the matrix equivalent
of expanding 1 over 1

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.490
plus epsilon for small epsilon.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.040
The reason that I
am doing this is

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.920
that I would now
like to look at how

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.458
the metric changes under this
coordinate transformation.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.910
So what I'm going to
do is define g mu nu

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.230
in the new coordinate system.

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.200
Usual operation.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.910
Let's now insert the many
different definitions

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.910
that we have introduced here.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:27.280
Notice that what I am using
for my transformation matrix

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.500
there is the inverse
that I just wrote down.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.630
So let's fill that in.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.990
So I'm going to get
a term that involves

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:59.420
a Kronecker minus a matrix
of partial derivatives.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:07.070
My other one gives me a
nether Kronecker matrix

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.230
of partial derivatives.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:13.400
And then finally,
don't forget we

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.150
are working in this nearly
flat space time metric.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.260
And so I insert in my
last term, eta alpha

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.300
beta plus h alpha beta.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.620
So now, let's go and expand
all of these terms out.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.440
My Kronecker,
first, I get a term

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:40.510
where both of the Kroneckers hit
the metric of flat space time.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.810
So what I get is eta mu nu.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.240
Then I get a term which
both the Kroneckers hit,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.400
the perturbation h alpha beta.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.740
Gives me h mu nu.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.720
Then, I'm going
to get terms that

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:59.200
involve these matrices of
partial derivatives hitting

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.450
the metric of flat space time.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.390
And what that's going to do is
in keeping with our principle

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.360
that when we're dealing with
spacetime quantities, we raise

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.200
and lower indices with eta.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.415
This is going to now give me--

00:33:17.415 --> 00:33:18.540
pardon me just one moment--

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.863
a term that looks like partial--

00:33:28.863 --> 00:33:30.530
everything in the
downstairs position, d

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.090
mu xi nu minus d nu xi mu.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.920
And then all the other
terms are on the order

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.000
of h times derivatives
of the generators

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.190
of my coordinate transmission.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.510
Small times small.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.870
These are infinitesimal squared.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:56.300
We are going to neglect them.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.970
Suppose that I insist that
I have gone from one nearly

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.127
flat spacetime to another.

00:34:01.127 --> 00:34:02.210
Bear in mind this picture.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.252
I'm just changing my
representation a little bit.

00:34:04.252 --> 00:34:05.810
I've not changed the physics.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:13.639
So if I write this as
eta mu prime nu prime,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.130
plus h mu prime nu prime.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.330
Well, I've got etas on both.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.480
The thing which
is interesting is

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.370
that I have generated a shift to
my perturbation to the metric.

00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:52.219
Let's drop the
primes for a second.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.420
And I'll just say
that my nu, h mu

00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:09.980
nu is the old h mu nu minus
the symmetrized combination

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.560
of derivatives of--

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.430
the symmetrized combination of
derivatives of infinitesimal

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.813
coordinate transformation.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.260
Does this remind us of anything?

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:33.870
This is starkly
reminiscent of the way

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:38.110
in which when we work with
electromagnetic fields,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:48.480
I can take a
potential, and shift it

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:56.410
by the gradient of some scalar
to generate a new potential.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.140
In so doing, what
we find is that this

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:03.370
leaves the fields unchanged.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:07.480
If you compute your Faraday
tensor associated with this,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.320
it is unchanged.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.870
Similarly, we're
going to write out

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.240
the details of this
in just a moment.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:31.840
When I generate the Riemann
curvature from this,

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.230
we find that although the metric
has been tweaked a little bit

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.210
by this coordinate
transformation,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.370
Riemann is left unchanged.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:00.990
In acknowledgment of this,
we call an infinitesimal

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.020
coordinate transformation
of this kind a gauge

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.235
transformation.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.210
What the gauge
transformation does

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.910
is it allows us to
change the metric,

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.742
or change the way that we
are representing our metric.

00:37:47.742 --> 00:37:49.200
And it's going to
turn out to leave

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.710
curvature tensors unchanged,
in the same way that

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.380
changing the potential
and electrodynamics

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.728
with a gauge transformation
leaves our fields unchanged.

00:37:58.728 --> 00:38:01.020
And we're going to exploit
this in exactly the same way

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.700
that we exploit this
in electrodynamics.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.490
We use this in
electrodynamics in order

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.790
to recast the equations
governing our potentials

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.640
into a form that is maximally
convenient for whatever

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.098
calculation we are
doing right now.

00:38:13.098 --> 00:38:15.473
We're going to find-- and then
we're going to derive this

00:38:15.473 --> 00:38:17.070
probably in about 20 minutes--

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:21.430
that the equations
that govern h mu nu.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.210
If we leave things as
general as possible,

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.210
they're a bit of a mess.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.420
But by choosing
the right gauge, we

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.700
can simplify them,
and wind up with a set

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.640
of equations that are--

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.490
they cover all physical
situations that matter,

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.480
and that allow us
to just cast things

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.040
into a form that is much
better for us to work with.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.420
All right.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.130
So we have now developed all
of the sort of linguistics

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:56.640
of linearized geometry
that I want to use.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.560
Let's now go from
linearized geometry

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.410
to linearized gravity by
running this through, and making

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.740
some physics.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.730
What I want to do
is look at the field

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.033
equations in this framework.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.260
I am not going to run through
every step of the next couple

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.260
calculations.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.070
Doing so is a good illustration
of the kind of calculation

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.680
that a physicist likes to call
straightforward but tedious.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.170
So I'm going to just write down
what the results turned out

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.590
to be.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:33.220
So let's run the metric
through the machinery

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:43.570
that we need to make all
of our curvature tensors.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.350
OK, I'll remind you when we
do this, we are linearizing.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.470
So anytime we see a term that
looks like h squared, it dies.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:05.020
So we're only keeping
things to linear order in h.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:14.270
So the first thing we find
is the Riemann tensor turns

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:22.280
into the following combination
of partial derivatives

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.840
of the metric perturbation h.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.300
In my notes, I have
written out what

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:54.230
happens when you switch
from some original tensor h

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:58.340
to a modified one using
this gauge transformation.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.710
And what I show is that--

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:02.690
just a quick aside--

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.560
the gauge
transformation generates

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:21.772
a delta Riemann
that looks like it's

00:41:21.772 --> 00:41:22.980
a whole bunch of-- let's see.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.813
Let's count them up.

00:41:23.813 --> 00:41:25.470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.785
You have eight terms.

00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:29.160
Of course there's eight,
because there's four terms here,

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.632
and you get two
more for each one.

00:41:30.632 --> 00:41:33.090
So you're going to wind up with
eight additional terms that

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.610
involve three partial
derivatives of the gauge

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.547
generator.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.460
So they're of the
form d cubed on xi.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.630
And it's not hard to show.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.920
You just sort of look at them.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.225
They cancel in pairs.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.970
And so delta Riemann is zero.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:13.352
The Riemann tensor is invariant
to the gauge transformation.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.090
All right, we want
to take this Riemann

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.890
and use it to build
the Einstein tensor.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:26.840
Our goal here is to
make the field equation

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.406
in linearized coordinates.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.540
So let's start by
making the Ricci tensor.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.010
So we're going to
raise and lower

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:57.010
indices in linearized theory
with the flat spacetime.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:07.690
So when we make this
guy, what we get is this.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.960
I've introduced a couple
of definitions here.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.940
One of them, you've seen before.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.980
The box operator is just a
flat spacetime wave operator.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:42.900
And h with no
indices is what I get

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:50.885
when I trace over h using the
flat background spacetime.

00:43:53.773 --> 00:43:54.690
And let's do one more.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:08.160
Evaluating r, I get one
further contraction.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:17.140
And this turns out to be
d alpha, d mu, h alpha mu

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.760
minus box of h.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.670
So we now have all
the pieces we need

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.258
to make the Einstein tensor.

00:44:27.258 --> 00:44:28.800
So I'm going to
write out the result.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.383
And then we're going to stop and
just look at it for a second.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:56.360
Einstein is Ricci minus
1/2 metric Ricci scalar.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.790
Keeping things to
leading order in h.

00:45:01.694 --> 00:45:05.060
This becomes flat spacetime
metric going into there.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.800
So when you put all these
ingredients together,

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.550
there's an overall
prefactor of 1/2.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.143
And then there are 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 terms.

00:45:18.143 --> 00:45:19.060
Let me write them out.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.480
OK.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.020
So recall at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.030
I pointed out that when
one regards G alpha beta

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.980
as just a differential operator
on the spacetime metric,

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.130
it's kind of a mess.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:12.370
Bearing in mind that what
I have here is a simplified

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.120
version of that,
I have discarded

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.410
all of the terms that are
higher order in h than linear.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:21.310
This is already pretty much
a bloody mess as it is.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.200
So you can sort of
see my point there.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.570
If this were done in
its full generality,

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.145
it would be kind of a disaster.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:36.930
Now, in linearized theory, there
is a bit of sleight of hand

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.880
that lets us clean
this up a little bit.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.810
Let me emphasize that the next
few lines of calculation I'm

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.450
going to write down,
there's nothing profound.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:46.920
All I'm going to
do is show a way

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.620
of reorganizing the
terms, which simplifies

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.130
this in an important way.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.670
So what we're going to do is
define the following tensor.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:10.390
h bar is h minus 1/2
eta alpha beta h.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.450
So this is a good point to
go, well, who ordered that?

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:16.120
Let's take the trace of this.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.420
Let's define h bar
with no indices

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.840
is what I get when
I trace on this.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.793
That's going to
be the trace of h.

00:47:25.793 --> 00:47:27.460
This would be the
trace of h alpha beta,

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:35.200
so I just get h back,
minus 1/2 h times the trace

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.620
of eta alpha beta.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.260
And the trace of eta alpha beta.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.510
This is what I get
when I raise one index,

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:43.180
and sum over the diagonal.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:43.990
That is 4.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:51.620
So the trace of h bar is
negative the trace of h.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:01.110
We call h bar alpha
beta the trace reversed

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.610
metric perturbation.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.070
It's got exactly
the same information

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:06.970
as my original
metric perturbation,

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.800
but I've just redefined
a couple terms in order

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.230
to give it a trace that
has the opposite sign

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.170
of the original perturbation h.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:22.020
The reason why this
is useful is recall

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:26.550
the Einstein tensor is itself
the trace reversed Ricci

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.200
tensor.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.540
What we're going to
see is that if we--

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.870
in acknowledgment that it's
sort of a trace reverse thing,

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.900
if I plug in a trace
reverse metric perturbation,

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.520
a couple of terms are
going to get cleaned up.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.600
So here's how we do this.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:46.560
So let's now insert h bar.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.820
This guy is going
to be equal to--

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.190
oops, pardon me.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.970
Insert h.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:49:03.350
This guy is h bar plus
1/2 eta alpha beta h.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:05.360
So just move that
to the other side.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.160
All I'm doing is
taking the definition,

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.070
and I am moving part of
it to the other side,

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.210
so that I can
substitute in for h.

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:14.830
When you plug this
into here, you'll

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.780
see that there are
certain cancellations.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.130
In particular, every term
that involves the trace of h,

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.920
h without any indices,
is canceled out.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:42.710
And so what you find doing this
algebra is that your Einstein

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:47.595
tensor turns into--

00:49:58.607 --> 00:49:59.440
that can't be right.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.580
OK.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.700
So now, my Einstein tensor
has no trace of h in it.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.760
Every h that appears
on its right hand side

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.890
is the tensor with
both of the indices.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:35.020
But now, it's the trace
reverse version of that.

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:40.000
This is still a bit of a mess.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.810
Now, we're going to do something
that's got a little bit more--

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:46.230
it's not just sleight of hand.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.340
This is something that's
got a little bit more

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.650
of sort of the meaning of
some of these manipulations

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:51.567
that we've worked out.

00:50:51.567 --> 00:50:55.540
It's going to play a role in
helping us to understand this.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:02.250
Notice this term involves
delta mu on h mu.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:07.380
Excuse me, partial mu on
h mu, partial mu on h mu.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.540
Partial mu and
partial nu on h mu.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.940
This is the only term that does
not look like a divergence.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.920
Three of the terms
in my Einstein tensor

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:39.660
look like divergences of
the trace reverse metric.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.845
Wouldn't it be nice if we
could eliminate them somehow?

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.140
Well, if you studied
gauge transformations

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.120
and electrodynamics,
you'll note that there's

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.470
something similar that is done.

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:05.690
You can choose a gauge, such
the divergence of the vector

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:06.680
for potential vanishes.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:21.640
Can we set the divergence
of this guy equal to zero?

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:25.660
So if you look at this,
mu is a dummy index.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:29.230
This is four conditions
that we are trying to set.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.425
This has to happen for mu--

00:52:31.425 --> 00:52:32.800
well, we're going
to sum over mu.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.300
Pardon me.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.260
It's going to happen
for nu equal time,

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.710
and for my three spaces.

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.503
These are four conditions.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:53:03.050
My gauge generators, my xi
nu are four free functions.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.120
That suggests that the
gauge generators give me

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.410
enough freedom that I
can adjust my gauge such

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.950
that if I start out
with some original,

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:27.300
I have an h old that
is not divergence free.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.430
Perhaps I can make
an h new that is.

00:53:32.308 --> 00:53:33.100
Well, let's try it.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.250
So remember, I just erased it.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.470
But in fact, I'll just
write it down right now.

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.440
The shift to the metric
perturbation arising

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.990
from the gauge
transformation, it's on h.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:07.520
We need to look
at how it affects

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.660
the trace reverse stage.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.320
So if I start with
my new perturbation

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.670
is related to my old
perturbation as follows.

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:36.760
It's not too hard to show
that your trace reversed

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.276
metric perturbation.

00:54:45.092 --> 00:54:46.050
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:57.170
My trace reverse
perturbation transforms

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:59.235
in almost the exact same way.

00:54:59.235 --> 00:55:00.110
I get one extra term.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.660
So now, what I
want to do is look

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:15.710
at how the divergence
of this transforms.

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:32.980
So I'm going to get one
term here, d mu of this.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:39.917
It gives me a wave operator
acting on my gauge generator.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:53.022
And then I get another
term here that looks like--

00:55:53.022 --> 00:55:54.605
remember, partial
derivatives commute.

00:55:54.605 --> 00:56:12.210
So you can think of this as d nu
of the divergence of xi, eta mu

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:20.090
nu acting on this
changes this into d

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:22.670
nu on the convergence of xi.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:26.220
And I messed up the
sign, my apologies.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.330
That plus sign should
have come down here.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:32.000
These are equal but opposite.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.570
They cancel.

00:56:35.850 --> 00:57:03.250
So let me just
highlight the result.

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:10.760
So what this tells me is if I
choose my gauge generators just

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:18.570
right, I can adjust my
trace reverse metric,

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.430
so that it is divergence free.

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:58.970
If I do that, then the first
three terms in my Einstein

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:00.410
tensor here vanish.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.420
And if I do that, then
here is my Einstein tensor.

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:30.640
So just as in e and m, all
that you need to do is say,

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.650
I'm going to change
my gauge such

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.045
that the following
condition holds.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.440
The condition that
describes going

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.900
into this gauge such
that the divergence

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.070
of your trace reverse
perturbation vanishes.

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:50.170
This is a simple wave equation.

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:53.185
So solutions to this
are guaranteed to exist.

00:59:16.783 --> 00:59:18.200
If you sit down
and you ask, can I

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.600
come up with some kind of
a pathological spacetime,

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.020
or a pathological--

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:22.870
no.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:24.530
Imagine I'm in some
original spacetime

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:27.992
sufficiently pathological that
doesn't allow me to do this.

00:59:27.992 --> 00:59:29.450
If you do that,
you're going end up

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.450
violating the conditions
that define weak spacetime.

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:34.970
You can't do that in
linearized gravity anyway.

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:38.510
So in practice, we can
always choose the gauge

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.600
that puts in linearized
gravity my Einstein

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.490
tensor in this form.

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:48.740
This form is exactly
analogous to the Lorentz gauge

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.580
condition that is used
in electrodynamics.

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:58.330
And so we call this Lorentz
gauge in linearized gravity.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:18.940
Once we've done that, here's
what my Einstein field

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.890
equations turn into.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:10.325
In the next lecture, we
will solve this exactly.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.920
See, what you want
to emphasize is

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.600
this is one of those
situations where the answer is

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.310
so easy and simple for
us all to work out,

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:29.710
we don't actually really need to
even do that much calculation.

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:38.190
I'll remind you that
in electrodynamics,

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:47.160
if you work in Lorentz gauge
of electrodynamics, the wave

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:59.020
equation that governs the
electromagnetic potential

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.828
turns out to be--

01:02:00.828 --> 01:02:02.620
could be factors of c
and things like that,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.810
depending on which
units you're working in.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.720
But we find an equation
that has exactly

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.150
the same mathematical structure.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:11.900
Possibly there's a plus sign.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.530
I should have looked that up.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:18.620
Wave operator on my vector
potential is a source.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.658
And this is very
easily solved using

01:02:20.658 --> 01:02:22.450
what's called a radiative
Green's function.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.670
I will discuss this
in the next lecture.

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:44.690
You can look up the details in
any advanced electrodynamics

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:45.190
textbook.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:48.640
Jackson has very nice
discussion of this.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.230
I have an extra index.

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:51.790
I have a different coefficient.

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:56.240
But the mathematical
structure is identical.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.700
So as far as linearized
theory is concerned,

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.270
we're basically done.

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.580
So I'm going to talk about
the exact solution of this

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.740
in the next lecture.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.170
To wrap up today's lecture, to
wrap up this current lecture.

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:13.420
Let me look at the solution
of this in a particular limit.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:41.560
So I'm going to
take my source to be

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:50.430
a static, non-relativistic,
perfect fluid.

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:02.800
The fact that it is static means
that all of my time derivatives

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.400
will be zero.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:09.620
And if that's true
for my source,

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.320
it has to be true for the
field that arises from it.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:23.300
Non-relativistic tells me
that the fluid density greatly

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:26.160
exceeds its pressure.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.000
And as a consequence, I
can write my stress energy

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:38.990
tensor as approximately density
four velocity four velocity.

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:41.690
And when you go and you look at
the magnitude of these things,

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:42.830
I sort of looked at
this a little bit

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:43.830
in the previous lecture.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.828
T00 is approximately rho.

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.560
All others will be negligible.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.780
Probably there's a small
correction to this,

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.090
but we can neglect
that on a first pass.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:35.970
So my field equation is
dominated by the zero zero

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:36.570
component.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:46.640
That's going to be the most
important piece of this.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.310
Since this is static,
I can immediately say--

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:57.559
I can change that wave operator
into the plus operator.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:07.020
And we now notice this
is exactly the equation

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.610
governing the Newtonian
gravitational potential,

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:11.880
modulo a factor of four.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.250
Pardon me, factor of minus four.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:32.360
And so we see from this
that h bar zero zero

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.700
is just negative 4 times
the Newtonian gravitational

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.659
potential.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:47.150
At this order in
the calculation,

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:51.620
all other contributions to the
trace reverse metric are zero.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.510
OK, so let's go from the
trace reverse metric back

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:08.110
to the metric.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:19.050
We use the fact that h mu nu
is the trace reversed h mu nu.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:22.493
If we trace reverse it, we'll
get the original metric back.

01:07:22.493 --> 01:07:23.910
Basically, we trace
reverse twice.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.440
So the trace of this guy.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.000
OK, and so putting all
these ingredients together,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.700
what we see are that the only
non-zero contributions here

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.753
are 8 0 0.

01:07:55.753 --> 01:07:56.920
Let's do this one carefully.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:13.360
This is minus 4 times Newtonian
potential minus 1/2 times 8 0 0

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.070
and 4 times Newtonian potential.

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:17.060
I have a c of minus sign here.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:22.630
This turns into minus 2 phi n.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:26.479
And h1 1 equals h2 2.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:29.060
h equals h3 3.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:37.290
This is going to be 0 minus
1/2 times 1 times 4 phi n.

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:49.130
We put all these together.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:31.755
And what we get is--

01:09:54.197 --> 01:09:55.030
And I'll remind you.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:58.990
This is a metric that I
quoted in a previous lecture

01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:01.530
that I said we would
prove in an upcoming one.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.860
Well, here it is.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:07.078
This is the Newtonian limit
of general relativity.

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:17.360
And it's worth remarking
that this thing--

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.030
we are now in the
very first lecture

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:24.250
after having derived the
Einstein field equations.

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:28.940
20 years ago, almost all
laboratory tests, laboratory

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.700
and astronomical observational
tests of general relativity

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.880
essentially came
from this based on.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.770
This ends up being
the foundation

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:38.390
of gravitational lensing.

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:41.780
This is used to look at
post-Newtonian corrections

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.090
in our solar system.

01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.270
To a good approximation, it
describes a tremendous number

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:51.770
of binary systems that
we see in our galaxy

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:53.510
and in a few other galaxies.

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:57.650
You really need to look for
a much more extreme systems

01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:02.120
before the way in which
the analysis changes

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.430
due to going beyond linear order
starts to become important.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.850
There is an upcoming
homework exercise.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:17.398
And for students taking this
course in spring of 2020,

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:18.815
it remains to be
determined how we

01:11:18.815 --> 01:11:20.750
are going to do problem
sets at this point.

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:23.330
I will be making a decision
on that in coming days.

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:26.870
But I want to tell you
about an exercise on P

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:33.000
set number 7, in which you do a
variation of this calculation.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.200
So instead of just
having a static body

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.930
with a body who has
massive density rho,

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:45.360
consider a rotating body.

01:11:54.253 --> 01:11:55.670
And the thing which
is interesting

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:59.240
here is that in
general relativity,

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.580
all forms, all fluxes
of energy and momentum

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:07.280
contribute to gravity through
the stress energy tensor.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.730
So if I have a body that
is rotating about an axis,

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:11.870
there's a mass flow.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:14.420
There are mass
currents that arise.

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.030
And what you find if you do
this calculation correctly

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:19.280
is that there is a correction
to the spacetime that

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.680
enters into here, which reflects
the fact that a rotating

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.990
body generates a
unique contribution

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:32.460
to the gravity that is
manifested in this space time.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.860
Now, when one looks
at the behavior

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.510
of a body in a
spacetime like the one

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:38.550
I've written down right here.

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.645
It's very reminiscent of--

01:12:40.645 --> 01:12:42.270
well, it's just like
Newtonian gravity.

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.830
It's the Newtonian limit.

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:46.740
And Newtonian gravity looks
a lot like the Coulomb

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.420
electric attraction.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.820
So this is often called
a gravito electric field.

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.445
People use that term,
particularly when

01:12:53.445 --> 01:12:57.000
they're talking about
linearized general relativity.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.180
If I have a rotating body,
I now have mass currents

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.280
flowing in this thing.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.530
And the correction
to the spacetime

01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:07.900
that arises from this, it's
qualitatively quite different

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:08.400
from us.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.850
It doesn't have that simple
gravito electric Coulombic type

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.960
of form.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.480
It, in fact, looks a lot
more like a magnetic field.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.570
And in fact, when
you ask, how does

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:22.500
this new term that is generated
affect the motion of bodies?

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.170
You find something that looks
a lot like the magnetic Lorentz

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:28.900
force law describing its motion.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:33.210
So this is a very,
very powerful tool.

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:34.620
But it's already not enough.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.770
So we can go a lot
further than this.

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:41.700
We have done so far, the
simplest possible thing

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:46.270
that we can do with this toolkit
that we have derived so far.

01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:48.270
In the next lecture
that I will record,

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:51.570
we're going to return to my
linearized Einstein field

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.400
equations.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.660
And I am going to explore
general solutions of this.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:03.540
This is going to lead us
into a discussion of how

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.060
things behave when my
gravitational source is

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:07.560
dynamic.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.320
I do not want to lose the
time derivatives that are

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.150
present in that wave operator.

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.400
And so this is going to lead
us quite naturally, then,

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.550
to a discussion of
gravitational radiation.

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:22.480
And so after the
next lecture, we'll

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.350
spend a lecture or two
discussing the nature

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:26.910
of gravitational radiation.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:29.340
And there will be an
upcoming homework assignment

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.340
or two in which you
explore the properties

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.790
of gravitational radiation.

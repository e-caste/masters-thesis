00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:24.010
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
get started.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.260
Everyone can go ahead and take
10 more seconds on today's

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.340
clicker question.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.580
This is about hybridization,
which we will go over more to

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.440
start today, but just
to see where we are

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.280
as a starting point.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.990
All right, great.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.170
So most of you got this.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.490
The question is what was the
hybridization of an atom if we

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.950
know that it has two
hybrid orbitals.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.630
This is really, really
important, so I'm just going

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.770
to write this out for that 20%
of you that didn't see this

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.870
right away.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.700
So we know that when we have
hybrid orbitals that come from

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.540
s and p orbitals, these are our
atomic orbitals we have to

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.420
choose from to hybridize.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
So if we know, for example,
that we need two hybrid

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.340
orbitals, that means we needed
to have started with two

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.310
atomic orbitals.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.550
So that means what we would
form are two s p hybrid

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.730
orbitals and we'd be left
with our other two p

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.910
orbitals left over.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.560
So any time you figure out that
you're going to need two

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.210
hybrid orbitals, and we'll go
over when you would find this

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.190
out in just a minute, but any
time that happens you know it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.980
has to come from an s and a p,
so that's why you'll end up

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.620
with s p hybrid orbitals
there.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.780
And exam 2 is happening in just
one week from today, so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.050
next Wednesday.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.780
The semester moves really fast.
So I can't believe we're

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.550
already up to exam 2
talk, but we are.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.060
So, you should have all received
two handouts when you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.340
walked in today, your notes and
then an exam 2 info sheet.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.500
Did everybody get that?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.400
If you didn't get it, just raise
your hand and a TA will

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.380
come to you with that.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.310
I see there's a few around, if
one of the TA's can jump up

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.590
and fill those in.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.510
All right, so basically,
as with exam 1, all the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.530
information you need to know
about what's going to be on

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.520
exam 2 is on this handout.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.420
Specifically exam 2
is going to cover

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.990
lectures 10 through 17.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.470
Today is lecture 16, so that
means it's going to cover

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.900
today's lecture and then a bit
into Friday's lecture as well,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.590
so I'll be really clear on
Friday where exam 2 material

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.480
ends, where you can kind of
switch off the exam 2 part of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.850
your studying.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.640
And it will also be on
problem-sets 4 and 5.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000
So it's going to be on two
problem-sets instead of three

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270
problem-sets, but as you know,
there are a lot of different

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.690
concepts covered in these
two problem-sets.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.150
So it's still a lot to be
thinking about and you need to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.520
make sure that you really
understand all of these

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.780
different concepts.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.520
So this is explicitly listed
in this sheet here, so make

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.300
sure you look it over.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.580
But I just want to say is well,
the concepts that we've

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.940
covered since exam 1 have been
talking about covalent bonds,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.530
going along with that are all
the Lewis structures that

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.610
we've done.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.950
Then we talked about ionic
bonds, so you need to make

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.390
sure you can solve those ionic
bond problems. And then we

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.500
started talking about different
types of bonding in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.690
terms of thinking about MO
theory, and also vesper theory

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.050
and hybridization.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.870
And then today, and a little
bit on Friday, you'll be

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.340
responsible for some of this new
material, which is going

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.360
to be a little bit of
thermochemistry.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.490
Not too much on exam 2, most of
that will be saved for exam

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.940
3 material, but an intro to
thermochemistry, that will

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.300
also be on the exam, just as
far as these two lectures.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.060
So, basically this is all
written out here, and I also

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.100
want to mention in terms of
your MO diagrams and MO

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.090
theory, I sent out an email
about this, but I also wrote

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.160
it out here so you have it
written down in terms of what

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.450
you are responsible for in terms
of ordering the energy

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.770
levels of molecular orbitals.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.470
So that's all written down
explicitly right here, this is

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.920
what you need to know
for the exam.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.190
Also it's helpful for the
problem-set as well.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.845
And also, in terms of MO
diagrams, I think that you

00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:02.880
will already gone over this
pretty explicitly either last

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.780
week in recitation or yesterday,
in terms of what

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.120
you need to do to get full
credit when you're actually

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.850
drawing an MO diagram.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.300
Just in case you don't have that
information or you didn't

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.240
write it down, I wrote this down
for you here as well in

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.610
terms of things like making
sure to draw your energy

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.580
arrows, or remembering
to label all

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.950
of your atomic orbitals.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.250
We don't want anyone getting
points off on the exam for

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.420
doing something silly where
they do understand what's

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.380
going on, but they're
just not writing it

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.280
in the correct form.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.240
So all this information
is on your sheet here.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.650
And also on this sheet mentions
that you will be

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.680
getting optional extra
problems on Friday.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.720
This is just like for exam 1.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.320
The way that you should approach
these extra problems,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.000
you don't need to turn them in,
you're not required to do

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.610
them, but if you want to do well
on the exam we really,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.490
really encourage that you do
these problems. And in terms

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.330
of having it be worth your time
when you're solving these

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.430
problems, what you want to do
is make sure you're at the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.890
point where you can put your
notes away, where you can sit

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.950
alone without your friends,
and really approach these

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.460
extra problems as if they're
exam problems. This way if

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.050
there's some conceptual leap
that you haven't quite made

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.230
yet, but you don't realize it
because you've been using your

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.830
notes or using the conversations
with your

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.960
friends, you want to make that
leap and run into those

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.270
problems alone in your room
when you have two hours to

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.860
figure it out.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.140
You don't want to do this
leap on an exam.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.970
That's not the ideal
situation.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.170
So especially with Lewis
structures where sometimes you

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.520
can run into confusions that you
need to work through and

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.870
make sure it all makes sense in
terms of your head how to

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.250
do this, make sure you take the
time to do that before the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.520
exam and don't have to end up
struggling with that on the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.560
exam in a time situation.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.290
All right, so the extra problem
solutions will be

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.800
posted on Sunday.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.870
And in terms of office hours for
next week, my office hours

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.020
are going to be on Monday from
2 to 4, I'm moving them up,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.640
and your TAs will move up their
office hours as well, so

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.330
check with them in recitation
or on the website.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.410
So that's pretty much
it for exam 2.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.865
Are there any questions about
what you're responsible for or

00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:05.220
anything regarding exam 2?

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.740
OK, and in terms of the room
it's in Walker again, so at

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.150
least this part should
be familiar.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.500
You'll be used to going to your
row, it'll be the same

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.090
row, it's all written here
again, but you can just do

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.730
exactly what you
did for exam 1.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.830
All right, so one last class
announcement, and this is that

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.920
if you've been looking at our
first sheet of the whole year,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.960
sort of the course overview
sheet, you know that our class

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.980
in terms of grading is out of
750 points, and 50 of those

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.810
points are for attendance and
something called occasional

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.920
in-class quizzes.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.400
So what we're going to do is
start filling in some of those

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.990
points because we only have 36
classes worth of attendance.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.240
So we have a couple of points
to make up in terms of

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.170
quizzes, and these are going to
be clicker quizzes, and let

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.980
me explain how this
is going to work.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.000
Basically, in at least for my
part of the class, what we're

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.050
going to do, because what I
really care about is that

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.670
people are answering the clicker
questions, it's really

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.600
valuable for me.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.700
I don't necessarily care if you
get them right or wrong

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.810
during class, because this is
the point at which you're

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.030
still learning them.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.070
So these quiz points, which
could be up to 2 points per

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.160
class, will be in addition to
attendance points, and you'll

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.870
get full credit if you answer
the quiz question.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.100
So you need to be answering
the questions because the

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.630
quizzes will not be announced.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.330
So this is another reward for
people that are always

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.410
participating.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.090
These clicker questions are
really valuable to us in terms

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.400
of the feedback, it really gives
me an idea of where the

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.790
class is as a whole.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.900
So really, it's important that
you are answering these

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.340
questions and this is a way to
get your quiz points up, so in

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.620
addition to attendance, you'll
get 2 quiz points.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.840
We'll have our first unannounced
quiz today, so you

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.970
won't know what problem it is
beforehand, so I suggest you

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.530
make sure you're answering all
the clicker questions, which

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.040
most of you do anyway.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.630
And I will just say I recognize
that some of you are

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.440
just scurrying across campus
to get here on time.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.960
So I'll never make that first
question a quiz question,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.660
because I know how hard it is
to get from one place to

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.280
another on this campus, and I
know most of you do a great

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.280
job of sneaking in right at the
last minute when you have

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.890
that long run.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.390
So we won't make the first
question a quiz question, but

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.930
be on the look out for a
quiz question today.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.290
All right.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.170
So let's get to today's topic.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.490
We're going to finish talking
about valence bond theory and

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.200
hybridization.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.870
So what we've already done is
really cover all the theory

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.440
that we're going to cover
behind how hybridization

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.660
works, and behind how valence
bond theory works.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.410
But what we haven't covered is
how do we actually solve

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.710
problems doing this in
the really quick way.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.730
So we're going to do that.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.940
This is going to be a more
practical lesson in

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.130
hybridization.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.170
And once we do that, we'll move
on to now talking about

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.000
energies and enthalpies
of chemical reactions.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.250
So this is a real shift.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.090
We spent a while talking about
single atoms, and then we've

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.290
spent most of the material,
since exam 1,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.850
talking about bonding.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.750
So now we're taking it one step
further and we're going

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.010
to actually get to talk about
some chemical reactions.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.290
So we'll do that once we
finish up with our

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.840
hybridization unit here.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.490
All right, so how do we
go about determining

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.140
hybridization in complex
molecules?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.780
It's actually incredibly simple,
and all that you need

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.930
to do is think about for the
given atom that you're looking

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.230
at, what you want to do is add
up the number of atoms that

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.460
are bonded to your central
atom, or the atom you're

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.260
considering, and add to that
the number of lone pairs.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.710
And what you end up with is the
number of hybrid orbitals

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.650
that you need.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.760
All right, so the theory behind
hybridization and

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.910
picturing everything, that can
be pretty complicated, and I

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.470
do want you to understand
that.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.630
But if, for example, on an
exam situation, you don't

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.520
necessarily have to think
through everything, you can

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.930
just use this very quick way
to figure out the number of

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.830
hybrid orbitals that you need.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.450
And what we just said is that
any time we need two hybrid

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:54.990
orbitals, we know that the
hybridization of that atom is

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.380
going to be s p, because
it's made up of

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.970
one s and one p orbital.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.140
So let's say we need three
hybrid orbitals.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.910
What is our hybridization of
our atom in this case?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.440
Yeah, it's s p 2.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.100
We want to take three atomic
orbitals to make three hybrid

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.720
orbitals, so it's going
to be s p 2.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.290
So what if we need four hybrid
orbitals, what's the

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.940
hybridization going to
be in this case?

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.240
STUDENT: S p 3.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.440
PROFESSOR: S p 3.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.890
All right, great.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.360
So, really that's it.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.450
Hopefully hybridization just got
a lot simpler for any of

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.810
you that have been struggling
a little bit with it.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.700
But let's go ahead and do an
example to make sure that we

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.970
can all do this.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.450
And let's take a look --
first let me mention

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.810
an exception here.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.900
The one exception to thinking
about how many hybrid orbitals

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.300
that you have are in the case
where you have single bonded

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.150
terminal atoms. So in the case
of a terminal atom that is a

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.730
single bond, you're not
going to hybridize it.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.500
So in that case, just don't even
change anything it's just

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.630
going to be one of the p
orbitals, or unless you're

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.900
talking about hydrogen in
which case will be an s

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.890
orbital that overlaps.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.520
All right, so we can illustrate
this with an

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.250
example of formal chloride.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.600
So this is a good example
because we're just dealing

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.110
with our carbon as our central
atom here, and we have three

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.750
terminal atoms, two of which
are single bonded, so we're

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.800
not going to hybridize those,
and one which is double

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.100
bonded, the oxygen, so we
will hybridize that one.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.540
So in terms of thinking about
the carbon, what is a

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.560
hybridization around
the carbon atom?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.730
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.360
PROFESSOR: All right, I'm
hearing some mixed answers.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.070
So let's think.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.570
So the carbon atom is bonded to
three different atoms, and

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.090
it has no lone pairs.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.870
So what's the hybridization?

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.570
STUDENT: S p 2.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.890
PROFESSOR: Good s p 2.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.430
So, if we're talking about the
c h bond, we're going to say

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.240
that it's carbon, it's a sigma
bond because it's a single

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.600
bond, and then it's carbon
2 s p 2 bonded to a

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.080
hydrogen 1 s orbital.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.060
All right, so let's take
a look at the carbon

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.660
chlorine bond here.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.850
Again, carbon is still 2 s p 2,
it's the same carbon atom,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.420
and it's going to be a sigma
bond because it's a single

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.120
bond, but what about the
chlorine, what atomic orbital

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.890
is going to be bonding
in the chlorine?

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.526
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:17.480
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.670
I'm hearing a little bit of
mixes, they're all p's, which

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.730
is a good start.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.780
It turns out that it's going
to be the chlorine 3 p z.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.570
So the reason that it's p is
because we're not hybridizing

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.990
it, and the reason that I
specifically say that it's the

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.760
p z instead of the p x or the
p y, is remember that the

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.960
z-axis, that's our bonding
axis, that's our

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.270
internuclear axis.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.280
So any time we have a p orbital
that's involved in a

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.510
sigma bond, it has to be the z
orbital because that's the

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.570
only one that has the right
orientation to overlap along

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.090
that z-axis.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.940
So we're going to say it's
carbon s p 2, and then

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.700
chlorine 3 p z.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.850
All right, so let's look at the
last bond here, which is a

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.980
carbon oxygen double bond.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.760
We know that any time we have a
double bond it's made up of

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.910
one sigma bond plus
one pi bond.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.710
So, when we look at the carbon
again, that's 2 s p 2.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.170
But what about the oxygen,
what's the hybridization of

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.490
this oxygen atom?

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.790
S p 2.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.270
So we're going to have carbon
2 s p 2, and then

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.060
oxygen 2 s p 2.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.590
It's s p 2 because the oxygen is
bonded to one atom plus two

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.000
lone pairs, so we're going
to have a total of

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.060
three hybrid orbitals.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.260
All right, so this is not our
only bond, we have a double

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.990
bond, so we also need to
talk about the pi bond.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.270
So if we talk about the pi bond,
we can say that's carbon

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.100
2 p y, then the oxygen 2 p y.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.910
We could alternatively say, and
be correct, that it was

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.840
the carbon 2 p x and
the oxygen 2 p x.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.240
Either one of those is fine.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.920
All right, so that's an example
of how we can assign

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.000
very quickly and very easily
what the hybridization is of a

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.290
given atom.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.890
And then also fully describe the
symmetry and the atomic or

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.120
hybrid orbitals that
make up bonds.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.600
So this is a lot of your
problems on the p-set, so if

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.700
you haven't finished that
section, hopefully you'll be

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.260
able to get through that section
pretty quickly when

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.470
you go back to it.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.650
And let's take a look at a
little bit of a more complex

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.040
molecule here, which is ascorbic
acid or vitamin C.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.740
And this is a good example
because it's starting to look

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.910
a little more complicated, but
not too much more complicated.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.070
But the reality is if you know
how to do assigning the

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.950
hybridization this way, even
if I gave you a 1,000 atom

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.420
protein, you should still
be able to get

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.330
it completely correct.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.280
Vitamin C is a really important
molecule to actually

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.780
think about in terms of thinking
about its shape and

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.260
its hybridization.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.180
Vitamin C is an antoxidant.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.780
So we might remember that from
when we were talking about

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.040
free radicals.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.450
Free radicals can cause
oxidative damage.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.080
These antioxidants, some of
our vitamins, including

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.300
vitamin C are antioxidants.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.500
So that's something that a lot
of people in the general

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.760
population know if they're
into their health.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.960
But another really important
thing about ascorbic acid is

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.870
that it's an enzyme cofactor.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.160
And a cofactor just means that
it's some type of molecule or

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.070
atom, in this case it's a
molecule, that's required by

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.990
an enzyme in order
for the enzyme to

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.670
carry out its chemistry.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.990
And the chemistry that the
enzymes that vitamin C are a

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.700
cofactor for are responsible
for putting oxygen, o h

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.350
groups, onto collagen molecules
in order to form

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.100
what is the collagen
triple helix.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.790
And collagen is the main
constituent of bones, of

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:44.070
joints, of connective tissue,
of many important structural

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.140
parts of our bodies.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.700
So you can imagine that vitamin
C is very important

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.960
because we need to keep
our collagen intact.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.460
Collogen is actually one of the
most prevalent proteins in

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.790
our entire body, and it makes up
a large part of our cells.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.960
So you can imagine if we don't
have collagen that is in this

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.910
triple helix, we're going to run
into some problems. Does

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.430
anyone, or I'm sure many of you
do know, but can someone

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.840
tell me what the name is of
the disease if you have a

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.410
deficiency in vitamin C?

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.560
STUDENT: Scurvy.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, scurvy.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.330
So scurvy, most often associated
with ships because

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:23.400
of the 1500's and 1600's and
1700's when boating technology

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.330
was far above biochemistry
technology, so people could

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.890
make ships and go on these long
journeys, but people did

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.190
not yet understand they needed
to keep certain vitamins in

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.720
their bodies, such as vitamin
C. Maybe also, they didn't

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.690
know about -- well they didn't
even have the structure, so

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.390
they couldn't have realized that
vitamin C is polar and

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.460
won't stay in their bodies for
very long, it will get

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.230
excreted out through
their urine.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.960
So they were not thinking about
how quickly they could

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.590
run into trouble in the
long sea voyages.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.360
And I don't know how many of you
had a unit on explorers in

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.610
elementary school --

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.500
I did in fifth grade, and one
that always sticks in my head

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.245
is Magellan's trip around the
world, who led the first fleet

00:17:02.245 --> 00:17:03.790
of ships around the globe.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.310
What they did not mention to us
in fifth grade was that 90%

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.020
of his men died on
that journey.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.030
And I understand we were young
kids, I didn't want to know

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.510
that at the time, but it's
interesting and it's really

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.460
important, and the reason
for many of

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.470
these deaths was scurvy.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.350
And it's totally preventable.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.420
And, in fact, the cure for
scurvy, which is as simple as

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.970
taking vitamin C in any form,
was known for -- since the

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.930
fifth century people started
figuring this out, but the

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.420
problem was there was so much
false information as well that

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.530
it was not a general practice
on ships to be treating men

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.000
that were suffering with vitamin
C or using it as any

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.790
kind of preventative measure.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.940
The other somewhat interesting
thing I want to say about

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.040
vitamin C is that it was part
of the first ever published

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.520
clinical study.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.270
And this was a controlled
clinical study that was done

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.790
in the 1700's, the first one
that's ever been reported, and

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.700
not surprisingly it was done on
a ship and it was done by

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.520
James Lind who was a Scottish
naval surgeon.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.260
And basically, he took 12 of
his men, so this was not a

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.800
very large clinical study like
they do today, but he took 12

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.680
men that were suffering from
scurvy, and he gave them a

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.300
diet mostly of just carbohydrate
mush, because

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.860
when you have scurvy, one of
the first signs is bleeding

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.540
gums and teeth falling
out, they couldn't

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.580
really eat too much.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.570
But he supplemented
their diet.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.550
He put them in pairs of two and

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.980
supplemented with 1 of 6 things.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.900
So two of them got a
pint of cider a day

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.580
to see if that helped.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.200
Two of them got half a pint of
seawater -- maybe not the best

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.330
group to be in.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.490
Even worse group to be in is
two of them got diluted

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.760
sulfuric acid.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.480
Tuned out that didn't
help so well.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.630
Other things where some got
spices, not so bad.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.250
And then two of them actually
got citrus fruit.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.760
So no big surprise ending to
this clinical study, the

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.580
people with citrus fruit were
completely cured and back to

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.320
duty within a week, and I'm not
sure exactly what happened

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.600
to everyone else, but
let's hope they got

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.170
switched over as well.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.730
But it's just neat to think
about even back then, people

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.600
were doing these controlled
scientific studies, this was

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.190
one of the first cases.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.350
Unfortunately, it was another
40 years between this study

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.180
being published and the
British Navy requiring

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.150
supplements of citric acid.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.320
So, really, we've come a long
way in terms of disseminating

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.740
scientific knowledge to the
community, and that's a really

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.510
important part of being
scientists -- not just making

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.680
these discoveries, but also
passing along, for example, to

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.060
these ships full of people
that need to know it.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.850
So, in terms of scurvy, we
don't see too much of it

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.230
today, but who should
be concerned about

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.600
suffering from scurvy?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.700
Do we have to worry about our
cats or dogs at home, are they

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.580
getting enough of their
vegetables and vitamin C?

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.270
It turns out we don't
have to worry.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.080
Primates are who should
be concerned.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.820
So we need to be concerned,
other

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.740
primates need to be concerned.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.120
It turns out that most other
mammals actually biosynthesize

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.870
vitamin C, so we don't have
to worry about most

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.040
of our pets at home.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.040
Unless you have a guinea pig
and they don't, in fact,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.870
biosynthesize vitamin C, so I
think they supplement most

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.240
guinea pig pellets with vitamin
C, but maybe keep an

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.470
eye on your guinea pig.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.320
We primates and guinea pigs are
the only types of mammals

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.430
that don't actually
biosynthesize their vitamin C.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.660
So again, vitamin C is a
cofactor, that means it needs

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.530
to bind to an enzyme, it means
that the shape of vitamin C

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.200
and the hybridization are going
to be really important.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.540
So let's take a look and talk
about some of these carbon

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.780
atoms here.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.230
And you can look at your
structure of vitamin C in your

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.010
class notes while you're doing
this, and first I want you to

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:48.940
tell me what the hybridization
is of that carbon a in the

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:59.780
vitamin C molecule.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:14.800
And let's take 10 more
seconds on that.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.620
OK, 78%.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.730
We'll do another question
like this in a minute.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.950
So if we can switch back
to the notes we'll

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.520
take a look at that.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.590
I think we can get better, I
think we can get to the 90's

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.260
with these hybridization, we
just need to follow the rules.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.910
So if we're thinking about
vitamin C and we're talking

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.860
about carbon a, how many things
is carbon a bonded to?

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.940
PROFESSOR: four things.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.210
We have two hydrogen atoms,
an oxygen, and

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.480
then another carbon.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.460
So that means we need, if it's
bonded to four things, we need

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.680
four different hybrid orbitals,
so it needs to be s

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.150
p 3 hybridized.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.320
All right, let's try this again
but just shouting out,

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.990
what is the hybridization
of carbon b?

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.230
Good.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.910
OK, I'm going to say that was
about 90% of you I heard,

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.240
which is excellent.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.370
S p 3.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.890
What about carbon c here?

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.840
Yup, s p 3 again.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.310
Bonded to four things
it's s p 3.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.300
What about carbon d?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.510
S p 2, great.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.450
Carbon e?

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.710
STUDENT: S p 2.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.610
PROFESSOR: All right, and this
last one, the last 10% of you

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.380
can join in.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.970
Carbon f?

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.200
Great, s p 2.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.100
All right, so we can also think
about shape once we know

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.800
hybridization and how
many atoms a carbon

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.990
atom is bonded to.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.150
What would we say that the
shape is of these s p 3

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.930
orbitals -- or the shape
of the carbon atom.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:52.160
Yeah, it's tetrahedral.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.610
So this is going to
be tetrahedral.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.950
And what about carbon
d, e, and f?

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.750
What is the geometry of
carbon d, e, and f?

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.160
Good, trigonal planar.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:14.750
All right.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.590
So let's actually take this
one step further from just

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.810
talking about the hybridization
of the

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:20.700
individual atom.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.950
Let's talk about a couple
of these bonds.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.700
I won't go through
all of them.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.040
I think you can get the idea
with just a few, but you can

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.150
go back and try all
of them later.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.950
So let's start with thinking
about carbon b hydrogen bond.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.330
Is this going to be a
sigma or a pi bond?

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.650
Sigma.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.510
We know it's sigma, because any
time we have a single bond

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.040
it's a sigma bond.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.220
So carbon b, we just said,
is carbon, it's

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.590
going to be 2 s p 3.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.240
And then hydrogen, what's the
atomic orbital we're talking

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.770
about here?

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.700
1 s.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.420
All right, great.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.870
So let's take a look at another
one, let's look again

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.340
at carbon b, but now let's talk
about it bonding to its

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.200
oxygen there.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.730
So again, are we going
to be talking about a

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.710
sigma or a pi bond?

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.110
A sigma bond, because again,
it's a single bond here.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:21.880
So what we'll say again is
carbon 2 s p 3, and let's take

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.930
a look at this oxygen
that it's bound to.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.530
Is this oxygen -- what is the
hybridization of this oxygen

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.980
right here?

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.850
What is it?

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.010
OK, good, it's s p 3.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.160
It's bound to two atoms, plus it
has two lone pairs, that's

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.980
a total of four things.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.950
So it needs to have three
different hybrid orbitals, so

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:51.150
we'll say it's oxygen 2 s p 3.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.980
So let's skip to a different
carbon now, let's talk about

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.550
carbon d, specifically the
carbon d oxygen bond.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.030
So let's do a clicker question
for this one.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.510
Let's get into the 90's, if you
don't mind, this would be

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.320
very good to do.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.120
It'll make me feel better
about you finishing your

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.810
problem-sets tonight.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.790
So if you talk about the
symmetry and the hybrid or

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.660
atomic orbitals that contribute,
we're talking

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.390
about the c d oxygen bond.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.310
So go ahead and look at
your notes and see

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.370
what that bond is.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.950
We already identified the
hybridization of carbon d, so

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.260
we really just need to think
about the oxygen here.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:26:04.340
All right, let's take
10 more seconds.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.230
OK, I'll take that, 84%.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.010
That's not bad.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.790
So again, we're looking
at a sigma bond here.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.170
It looks like the one people
got it confused with was

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.660
talking about oxygen
s p 2 versus s p 3.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.710
Remember, you just need to look
at what it is actually

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.260
bound to, so for carbon d, the
oxygen's bound to two atoms

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.890
plus two lone pairs, so it's
going to be s p 3 hybridized.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:32.660
So we'll call this a sigma bond
where we have carbon 2 s

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.960
p, now it's s p 2, and
oxygen 2 s p 3.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.300
All right, let's take a look
at just one more here.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.430
So, let's look at the carbon
d bond with carbon e.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.750
So if we can switch back to the
class notes just to see

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.780
that, though you guys can see
it on your notes as well.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.300
So in terms of that, we're
talking about a double bond

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.650
now, so we know that we have to
have one sigma bond and one

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.090
pi bond to completely describe
our double bond.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.220
So for the sigma bond, again,
it's going to be

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.710
carbon 2 s p 2.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.780
And now we're talking about
the other carbon.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.660
What is the hybridization
of the other carbon?

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.660
Yup, s p 2.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.040
So carbon 2 s p 2.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.420
All right, but we're
not done there.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.250
We also need to talk
about the pi bond.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.730
So for the pi bond, we'll talk
about carbon 2 p y, and then

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.110
the second carbon 2 p y.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:33.970
All right, so I filled in a few
more in your notes, so you

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.340
can maybe cover those up and
make sure that you get all of

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.330
those correct is a good self
test before you finish off any

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.490
in your problem-set.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.920
Does anyone have any questions
about figuring out

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.580
hybridization?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:44.810
Yes?

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.750
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.450
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry,
what is that?

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.200
In this bond here?

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.310
Oh, OK, that's a
good question.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.740
So the question was why is there
not hybridization in

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.290
these p orbitals here.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.250
So in order to form a double
bond, we need to have a pi

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.060
bond forms, and a pi
bond forms from two

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.720
unhybridized p orbitals.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.640
And if you can kind of picture
those p orbitals, if our

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.170
molecules are this way and
they're coming up here, we

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.530
need to have electron density
above the bond

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.710
and below the bond.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.000
So if they're hybrid, then
they're going to be spread out

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.120
into that tetrahedral
geometry.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.130
We want to have them parallel to
each other and they need to

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.420
be the p bonds, they need
to be the p orbitals.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.440
Does that makes sense?

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.330
So any time we have a double
bond, the pi part of the bond

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.100
is going to be p orbitals.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.180
Yes?

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.740
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.360
PROFESSOR: No, absolutely not.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.490
It would be absolutely correct
to put 2 p x and 2 p x here,

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.130
you just can't put z, because
that's the one that's going to

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.660
be involved in the sigma bond.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.740
And the other important thing
is if you do put x for one,

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.010
you have to make sure you put
x in the other, because they

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.470
do need to be able to interact
with each other.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.490
You can't have one x and one y,
but sure, you can have both

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:02.160
x or both y.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.240
OK, so let's shift gears a
little bit and start talking

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.120
about bonding in terms of
chemical reactions.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.820
So we're going to start today
with talking about bond

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:19.760
energies, and also something
called bond enthalpies.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.310
And the first point is just to
bring us back to something

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.490
we're very familiar with.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.580
When we talked about covalent
bonding, a concept that we

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.930
have been discussing is bond
dissociation energy.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.210
That's just the energy that's
required to put into a

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.590
molecule in order to
break that bond.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.570
This is something that we saw
when we were talking just at

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.410
the very beginning of our
unit on covalent bonds.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.450
That energy difference is the
energy difference between when

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.180
we have the c h 4, if we're
talking about methane, versus

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.460
one of those hydrogen bonds
breaking, one of those c h

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.800
bonds breaking.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.080
So we've talked in the past
about bond energy, but what I

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.560
want to introduce to you today
is a very related concept,

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.380
which is called bond enthalpy.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:08.400
So that's delta h here is what
we call bond enthalpy.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.870
So, this is talking about
instead of the change of

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.380
energy accompanied with a bond
breaking, we're talking about

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.350
a change in heat accompanied
with a bond breaking.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.920
So whether when that bond breaks
it requires heat, or

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.310
whether it gives off heat when
you break that bond or talking

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.060
about a reaction.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.250
That's what we're talking
about when we're

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.770
talking about enthalpy.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.690
It turns out that enthalpy is,
in fact, very related to

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.350
energy, and we can relate it
with this equation here that

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.420
bond enthalpy is equal to bond
energy plus the change in

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.350
pressure times volume.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.120
So we could, in fact, go back
and forth between bond

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.670
energies and bond enthalpies,
but the reality is if we're

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.970
talking about gases, which we
are in many cases, then what

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.100
we find is the difference
between bond enthalpy and bond

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.000
energy is only 1% to 2%.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.770
So it's not very significant.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.390
And, in fact, if we're talking
about solids or liquids, now

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.460
we can say that the difference
between bond energy and bond

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.910
enthalpy is going to
be negligible.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.410
So, for the rest of this class
today, we're going to stop

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.880
talking about bond energy, which
I did just for a moment,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.880
to orient you back to a
discussion that was familiar,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.770
we're going to switch our
discussion to bond enthalpies.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.780
One reason that we like to
talk about enthalpies is

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.040
unlike energy, which can be a
little bit more tricky, bond

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.970
enthalpies are easy
to measure.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.330
It's easy to measure how much
heat a reaction gives off or

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.790
how much heat a reaction
takes in.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.550
So we can also talk about
something, which is called the

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.020
standard bond enthalpy, so any
time you see this symbol here,

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.110
which looks like a knot, so it
looks like a delta h knot,

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.110
that refers to the standard
bond enthalpy.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.680
Any time we we're talking about
a standard, whether it's

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.900
enthalpy or, as we'll see in
the next lecture, standard

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.680
entropy or a standard free
energy, we're just saying that

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.450
the molecules that we're talking
about are in their

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.440
standard states, which means
they're in their pure form.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.850
If they're a gas it means
they're at one bar.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.740
Usually this is referring
to room

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.070
temperature, so 298 kelvin.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.570
It's often that when you look
up tables of different bond

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.215
enthalpies, you'll see them in
their standard state and it

00:32:17.215 --> 00:32:18.710
will be at room temperature.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.830
So if we talk about standard
bond enthalpy, let's talk

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.450
about what this is for these
c h bonds, which

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.280
we just saw in methane.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.820
So if we're going from c h 4 to
breaking one of these c h

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.990
bonds, what we see is that
the bond enthalpy is 438

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.640
kilojoules per mole.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.650
The fact that it's positive
tells us that we need to put

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.090
in that much heat into
the system in order

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.240
to break that bond.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.060
So we now know the enthalpy of
a c h bond, but, of course,

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.520
methane is not the only
kind of c h bond

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.850
that you can envision.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:52.180
We could talk about the c h
bond, for example, in ethane

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.650
or trifluoromethane or trichloro
or tribromomethane,

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.570
and what you'll find is that
the amount of enthalpy that

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.140
that reaction is associated with
depends on the exact type

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.470
of c h bond that you have. So,
for example, we can see that

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.060
we have slightly different,
not vastly different, but

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.690
slightly different changes in
enthalpy depending on which

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:17.090
kind of c h bond that
were breaking.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.570
And what I want to point out
also is that all of these

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.690
delta h's, all of these
standard bond

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.580
enthalpies are positive.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.420
Any time we have a positive
delta h, we call this an

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.320
endothermic reaction.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.080
And again, endothermic
just means that the

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.380
reaction takes in energy.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.220
It's very similar to what when
we're talking about energy

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.125
whether something's taken in
or released, whether it's

00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:41.060
positive or negative.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.510
If you have positive delta h,
it's endothermic, it takes in

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.040
heat in order for the
reaction to go.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.830
So we can think about instead of
talking about all of these

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.840
individual c h bonds, instead
we can talk about what the

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.090
average value would be
for all c h bonds.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.610
So we can say that the average
of any c h bond is 412

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.010
kilojoules per mole.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.360
So you can imagine if you're
looking these things up in

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.910
terms of a reference table or
maybe in the appendix of your

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.140
textbook, it would be an
impossibly huge number of

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.630
pages to write every single
different kinds of c h bond.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.650
So that's why instead they talk
about the average bond

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:17.680
enthalpies.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.370
So for c h, again, that's 412,
and all of the enthalpies we

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:24.360
just saw fall within
about 8% of that.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.710
And in your book you can look
up any type of bond that's

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.680
listed here.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.840
So we saw c h is 412.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.110
You can look up a c c bond, you
can look up a c c double

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.610
bond, a c c triple
bond, and so on.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.270
And you'll note that what
these are are mean bond

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.990
enthalpies, so they're the
average of all different types

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:47.300
of c h bonds or c c bonds
that you can imagine.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.360
So, you might be asking what's
so important about being able

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.710
to look up and think about
these different bond

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.670
enthalpies.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.890
And the reason that it's
important is because if you're

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:58.660
looking at a reaction, no matter
how complicated that

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.540
reaction is, you can actually
figure out what the enthalpy

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.210
of the entire reaction is by
adding up all the individual

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.720
mean bond enthalpies of the
products, and all the

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.760
individual mean bond enthalpies
of their reactants

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.480
and thinking about the
difference between those two.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.240
So we'll do that in just a
second, and the reaction that

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.330
we'll do it with is the
oxidation of glucose here.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.733
So, c 6 h 12 o 6, one mole of
glucose plus six moles of

00:35:26.733 --> 00:35:29.610
oxygen, gives us six moles
of carbon dioxide and

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.320
six moles of water.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.310
So what we can find out, and
hopefully what we will match

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.700
up when we look at using the
different bond enthalpies, is

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.250
that the enthalpy of this entire
reaction is negative

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.220
2816 kilojoules per mole.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.200
So in this case we're saying
that delta h is negative.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.400
Does anyone know what
it's called

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.030
when delta h is negative?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.280
Everyone knows, great.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:52.960
So it's exothermic.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.500
This is an exothermic reaction,
the reaction

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.870
releases heat.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.420
So I just want to mention before
we go on, if you look

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.060
at almost any freshman chemistry
textbook, what

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.910
you'll find is this oxidation of
glucose reaction is used a

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.820
lot in talking about
thermochemistry.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.920
And one reason it's talked about
is because it's very

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.070
convenient to talk about
something where we start with

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.120
one mole of glucose and end up
with 12 moles of products.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.290
That's going to be helpful what
we're doing a practice

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.740
problem to see exactly how you
deal with it when there's

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.330
different numbers of moles.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.570
But the other reason you always
see this reaction is

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:32.030
because it's an incredibly
important reaction.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.840
The oxidation of glucose is
going on all the time in our

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.620
body, this is our main source
of energy for all animals.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.600
So let's think a little bit
about why this reaction is so

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.170
important and so prevalent.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.950
It turns out that if we're
talking about plants, plants

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.620
do the reverse reaction.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.130
So plants take carbon dioxide
and water and they turn it

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.720
into glucose or energy for us,
energy stored in the bonds of

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.850
glucose plus oxygen.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.220
So if we do the reverse
reaction, this is actually

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.960
going to require energy.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.080
Where do plants get
this energy?

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.520
Yeah, this is just
photosynthesis here.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.430
This is the photosynthesis
where plants are turning

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.120
carbon dioxide and water into
sugar and into oxygen.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.990
So what happens when we eat
the plants or when we eat

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.080
animals that have eaten the
plants is that we perform the

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.990
reverse reaction now, which is
what I just showed you, the

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.660
oxidation of glucose.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.230
And even though it's not the
products of the reaction that

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.070
are particularly valuable to us,
we just breathe out the c

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:36.040
o 2, and actually we'd rather
have less of that than more in

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.640
our environment, but what's
important here is instead the

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.990
energy or the enthalpy that's
given often in this reaction.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:47.240
So as I said, this reaction
has a negative enthalpy of

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.920
2816 kilojoules per mole.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.560
That's a lot of enthalpy
and a lot of energy.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.170
So we actually end up using that
energy to fuel most of

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.610
what is going on
in our bodies.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:01.400
So instead of storing it as
sugar, once we oxidize the

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.240
sugar, now we just store it as
ATP, and as you know, ATP is

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.480
the currency of energy
in the cells.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.350
So this is why you see this
reaction again and again and

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.630
again in just about any
chemistry textbook that you

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.040
open up as sort of a
general reaction.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.920
The reason it's used is it's
just so important and so

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.930
prevalent in terms of thinking
about our bodies and how we're

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.890
staying alive and
using energy.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.240
All right, so let's go ahead and
use this as an example of

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.170
what we just said, which is
using the bond enthalpies of

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:34.750
the products and the reactants
to figure out the enthalpy of

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.620
the entire reaction.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.830
So the way that we do this
is we add up all of the

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:43.520
individual mean bond enthalpies
of the reactants,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.940
and we subtract from that all
of the individual bond

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.700
enthalpies of the products.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.830
So we can think about what
this will tell us.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.570
If you think about the fact if
the bonds are stronger in the

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.350
products than they were in the
reactants, you can go ahead

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.430
and click in and tell me if
you think we'll have a

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.490
negative or a positive
delta h here.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:31.090
All right, let's take 10
more seconds on this.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:38.250
OK, great, so negative is
correct and some people got

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.090
totally mixed up.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.940
Didn't just get one thing --
so let's just focus on the

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.900
right answer to start with.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.070
The correct answer is that
it's negative, it's an

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.400
exothermic reaction.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.000
And actually, lets switch
to our class

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.420
notes to explain why.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.040
And also, this was the quiz
question for today, so whether

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.000
you got the answer correct or
incorrect, you get full quiz

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.990
points if you did,
in fact, answer.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.620
But let's still focus on the
right answer here and see why

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.680
it's correct.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.750
So if we're talking about the
bonds being stronger in the

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:09.290
products, that basically means
that we ended up releasing a

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.340
lot of heat when we made those
bonds and the products, and we

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.000
didn't have to use up too much
of that heat to break all the

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.380
bonds and the reactants.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.190
So that's why we say
that delta h

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.340
is going to be negative.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.490
You could also just do it not
conceptually, just plugging it

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.920
into the equation, but it's
better to kind of understand

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.490
exactly why that is.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:30.960
It's because it takes more
energy -- you gain more energy

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.970
forming the products
than you take

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.580
breaking up the reactants.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.320
So if we have the opposite case
here, if the bonds are

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.430
stronger in the reactants, now
what we're going to find is

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.750
that the delta h of the reaction
is positive and what

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:49.590
you're dealing with is an
endothermic reaction.

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.200
So let's go ahead and do this
with our example of the

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.320
oxidation of glucose.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.210
So, I've just written out the
glucose molecule so you can

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.055
see all of its individual bonds
here since we're going

00:41:01.055 --> 00:41:04.210
to be using that information.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.610
So let's start by talking
about the bonds that are

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.040
broken in terms of thinking
about all of

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.420
the reactants here.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.800
So if we're talking about the
sugar molecule itself, what we

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.090
have is we have seven
c h bonds.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.400
And if we add up all the o h
bonds, we have five of those.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.790
How many c o single
bonds do we have?

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.690
What do people think?

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.030
Yeah. five c o single bonds.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.890
What about c c single bonds?
five of those as well.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.610
C o double bonds?

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.360
Just one c o double bond.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.070
And then we have our oxygen
molecule to worry about and we

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.150
have six o o double bonds.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.810
So if we add up all of the
bonds are broken, and we

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.780
subtract from that the bonds
that are formed, those

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:57.650
strengths, the c double bond
o, we have 12 of those.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.200
And how many o h bonds
do we have?

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.960
Right, 12 as well.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.290
So if we add up all the bonds
broken, what we end up with is

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:11.790
12,452 kilojoules per mole,
and it's talking about per

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.350
mole of glucose that's
oxidized.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.850
And in terms of bonds formed,
what we see is 15,192

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:21.740
kilojoules per mole.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:27.190
So all we need to do to figure
out the change in enthalpy,

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:30.380
and when it has this subscript
r here, I meant to mention,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.740
that means the enthalpy
for the reaction.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:38.290
We just subtract these bonds
here from the ones that we

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.480
ended up forming.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.570
So basically, what we're saying
-- excuse me, these are

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.660
the ones that we broke.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:51.480
It's 12,452 minus 15,192,
which we formed.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.370
So we end up with an enthalpy of
reaction of negative 2,740

00:42:55.370 --> 00:43:01.090
kilojoules per mole of glucose
that's oxidized.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.570
All right, so if you remember
the number that I told you

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:08.240
before, it doesn't exactly match
up with what we had said

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.250
is the exact number.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.400
The exact number is 2,816.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.200
It is within 3% though,
that's pretty good.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.020
Because remember, we're not
using exact bond enthalpies

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.160
here, what we were using is
average bond enthalpies.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.180
So it makes sense that we're
going to be a little bit off.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.610
But if all you have in front of
you is the information on

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.270
bond enthalpies, mean bond
enthalpies, this is a great

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.530
way to figure out the enthalpy
of an overall reaction.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.990
We can think of a different way,
however, to think about

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.460
the enthalpy of an overall
reaction, and this is talking

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.460
about the heat of formation.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.680
And the heat of formation or
delta h formation here is

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.680
equal to the heat of -- or the
enthalpy of reaction, if we're

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.420
talking about forming one mole
of compound from its pure

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.850
elements, which are in their
standard states.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.340
So basically, there's a table
that you can look up which

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.770
tells you the enthalpy of
formation for any compound

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.100
that you're interested in, and
this is actually an appendix

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.340
to of your textbooks, and you
will need to use this to solve

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.630
your problems on p-set.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:14.390
But let me say that, for
example, if we're talking

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.170
about water here, that's formed
from hydrogen and

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:20.390
oxygen, if we're talking about
the elements in their pure

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:26.050
forms at one bar, standard
states, and room temperature.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.600
And if we look this up in our
textbook, we would find that

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.610
the delta h of formation for
water is negative 286

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.800
kilojoules per mole.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.440
Similarly we can look up the
same thing, for example, for

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.590
carbon dioxide, and what we'll
find here is that our delta h

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:46.050
of formation that we look
up is negative 393 .

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.940
5 kilojoules per mole.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.850
We can also look up or think
about what our delta h of

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.940
formation would be for oxygen.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.080
Does anyone have a guess here?

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.990
Yup, it's actually
going to be zero.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.800
Oxygen already is in its most
stable state, so any time

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.520
we're talking about an element
in their most stable state,

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.690
it's going to be zero.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.040
That's going to be the delta
h of formation, there

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.650
is none, it's zero.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:15.820
We can also look up what it was
for sugar, for glucose, c

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.050
6 h 12 o 6.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:22.406
So that coming from its most
stable forms, it was the most

00:45:22.406 --> 00:45:25.880
pure form of the elements, is
going to be negative 1260

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.600
kilojoules per mole.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.060
All of this information has
been tabulated and is in

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.380
tables, you can refer to them,
and they're also in the back

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.940
of your textbook, so you can
refer to those in terms of

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.370
your problem-set.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.410
So let's go ahead and solve a
problem actually using the

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.030
delta h's of formation.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.100
Let's see if we can do any
better to coming close to the

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.620
reality for the oxidation
of glucose.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.970
So if we're going to calculate
the delta h for the reaction

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.500
for the oxidation of glucose,
or actually for any reaction

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:58.370
at all, what we want to do is
take the delta h of formation

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:02.280
of the products and subtract
from that the delta h of

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.340
formation of the reactants.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:08.000
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.940
And in terms of talking about
the oxidation of glucose, if

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:19.410
we talk about delta h of this
reaction, what we need to take

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:25.350
is 6 times delta h of formation
of c o 2, since

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.450
we're forming, that's in our
products, we're forming six

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.780
moles of c o 2.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:38.120
Plus 6 times delta h formation
of h 2 o, since we're forming

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.510
six moles of h 2 o.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:45.450
And we subtract from that the
heat of formation of all of

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.260
our reactants.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:51.640
So we only have one mole, so we
just say delta h formation

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:59.770
of c 6 h 12 o 6, and then in
addition to that we have six

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:07.760
moles delta h formation
of oxygen, of o 2.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.030
All right, so this is our
equation here and at this

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:13.310
point what we would do is we
would look up what all of the

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:17.150
delta h formation values
are for c o 2, h 2

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:21.720
o, sugar, and oxygen.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:27.910
So what we would find is that
we end up having 6 times

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.150
negative 393 .

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.530
5 -- that's what we had
just looked up and

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.030
told you for c o 2.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:39.280
Plus 6 times negative 285 .

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.400
8 for the water.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:51.200
Minus 1 times 1260, so
it's negative 1260

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.430
for our sugar here.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.570
And then what we're going to end
up with is having minus,

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.270
and what is it for
oxygen again?

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.220
So minus 0.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.620
So what we end up with in terms
of the delta h for the

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.820
entire reaction here, is we end
up with negative 2816, and

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:21.920
it's going to be kilojoules
per mole of glucose.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.960
All right, so let's see how this
matches up, and hopefully

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.860
you can actually remember that
this matches up actually

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.510
perfectly here.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:34.450
So what we are going to see
is that, in fact, what we

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.630
calculated versus what
is experimental

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:38.100
is dead-on the same.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.630
So there's actually one more
way to figure out the

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.780
enthalpies of a reaction,
I'm going to go over

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.510
it just very briefly.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.510
And that's based on the fact
that enthalpy is a state

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:51.280
function, and by state function
what I mean is that

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.220
it doesn't matter how you got
from point a to point b, all

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.740
that matters is the difference
between the two.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.030
So another example of a state
function is altitude, for

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.120
example, on a mountain.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.440
So if you're talking about
altitude, you go from point a

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:11.060
to point b on the mountain, and
it doesn't matter how you

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.960
got there -- you could have
climbed all the way up the top

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.050
of the mountain, then went
back down and eventually

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:17.400
landed on point b.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.990
Or you could have gone
straight from

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.630
point a to point b.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:24.000
The change in altitude between
point a and point b do not

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.890
depend on the path, they're
independent of path.

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.960
So this difference right here
does not matter on how you got

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.600
there, it does not make a
difference how you got there,

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.650
altitude is a state function.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.810
So similarly, we can say that
enthalpy is a state function

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:43.290
as well, if we're talking about
part reaction a here,

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:47.770
which has our reactants going
to our products in 2 b here.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.900
It doesn't matter how
we got there.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.550
We can actually calculate the
change in enthalpy at all

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.860
different points here.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.840
All that we actually have to
worry about at the end of the

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.510
day is the difference
between a and b.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:02.320
So that's what we mean
by state function.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.440
Actually, we're not going to
have a chance to get to fully

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.950
explaining the consequence of
this, which is Hess's law,

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:11.930
which allows us to add and
subtract different reactions.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.880
So what I'm going to say is the
last two problems on your

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.580
problem-set you won't have to do
because we're not going to

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.230
get a chance to cover
in class on Friday.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:24.270
So I'll send out an email about
this as well, so that'll

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.940
be pushed back.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.070
So, it will be on the exam, so
you want to do them at some

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:31.350
point, but you don't need to
actually turn those in.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:34.260
So those are the last two
problems, I believe.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I am the other half of
the teaching team for 7.01.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You've already gotten to meet
my good colleague Bob Weinberg.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My name is Eric Lander. And Bob
and I are both faculty here in the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Biology Department. In fact,
we're both members over at

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Whitehead Institute
for Biomedical Research.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In fact, we just spent the whole
weekend together at the Whitehead

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Retreat. And so, Bob and
I have been doing this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
course together for a number
of years. And we very much

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
love it. I am -- I'll
take a brief moment and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
introduce myself, since I
haven't had the opportunity

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to do so yet. I am by training,
well, actually, I'm really a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
geneticist. By training I'm
actually a pure mathematician.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That was actually what my
undergraduate degree was in,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and even my PhD was in, but
then wandered into biology.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And for the last almost 20 years,
I have been doing genetics in some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
form or another. So I love
genetics and look forward

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to talking a lot about genetics.
And it's really lovely that my

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
first lecture today is actually
going to be our first introduction

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to genetics. I am -- Just
for other backgrounds,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I direct this new Broad Institute
that is here. And it's actually a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
joint institute between MIT and
Harvard. And you will know it now

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as a hole in the ground
next to Legal Seafood.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If you see a bunch of cranes and
things opposite the biology building

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and opposite Legal Seafood
next to the Whitehead,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that's the Broad Institute. And
we have ambition some day to be

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
more than the hole in the ground but
to actually rise above the ground.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And the Broad is about genomic
medicine and using genomes

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and things like that. And
the Broad Institute includes

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this center at MIT that was one
of the leading participants in the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Human Genome project. So
that's a lot of what I do with

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
my day job, in addition to teaching,
is work on things like the Human

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Genome project. And, now
that we actually have a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
sequence to the human genome,
figuring out what in the world it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
all means. And I hope I'll
get a chance to tell you,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
during the course of this class,
about the human genome and about

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
what's in it and things like that.
Like I say, that's one of the things

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I tremendously love about
teaching biology as opposed,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
if I can get in trouble,
to any of the other required

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
introductory courses, is that
our curriculum changes every

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
year because the field is moving
so rapidly. I look back at what we

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
taught ten years ago in this course,
because I've been teaching it that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
long, and all sorts of open
questions now we know the answers to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and are part of the curriculum.
Some of the things we thought we

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
knew we now know are false
and we know new things.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And every year we get
to introduce new stuff.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I know, I mean with
all due respect to calculus,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it's just not the case for calculus
that there's anything really new to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
introduce. Most of it sort of
settled down about three or four

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
centuries ago.
And, you know,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that's just not the case
with what we do. Anyway,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
so that's why I love it. All
right. So Bob has been talking

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to you about biochemistry largely.
And I'm going to now turn to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
genetics. But I want you to
understand that that is an

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
overarching framework that explains
how all the materials you're going

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to see, at least in the first half
or more of this course fit together.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And Bob may have mentioned it,
but I'm going to mention it again,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I would use this following diagram
as kind of our roadmap or subway map

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of where we're going in this
course. What we really want to do is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
understand biological function.
That's what we most want. How is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it that an organism is able to
breathe in air and distribute it to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
its cells? How is it that an
organism is able to move its muscles?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
How is it that an organism is able
to fight off invaders to its body,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
microbes, things like that? How is
it that an embryo develops into a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
full adult? Zillions of questions.
That's what I mean by biological

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
function. The two complimentary
approaches to studying biological

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
function, over the course of the
past century or so in biology,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
have been the following. There
have been the biochemists.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Biochemistry seeks to break
down the organism into individual

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
components and study them
on their own in a test tube.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
They will take an organisms, and
to a biochemist wishing to study

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the beauty of a butterfly flapping
in the wind and understanding all of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
the mechanics of how it could
possibly flap those wings and all,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
he or she would start by taking the
butterfly, putting it in the blender,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
pressing puree and making an extract,
and trying to purify individual

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
components that would explain
muscles moving back and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
forth and all that.
This is, of course,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
a geneticist's point of view,
but it's all right. You have Bob

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
who will represent biochemistry just
fine. And they want to purify out

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
individual components. Individual
components away from the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
organism. And the most
important individual

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
type of component that they study
are proteins because there are

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
zillions of proteins and they do
all sorts of things in the body.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And so you could say, in some
sense, that this whole theme of

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
biochemistry, which got started
at the turn of the 20th century,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
really just a few years before
the turn of the 20th century,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of grinding up an organism,
studying its components and being

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
able to find, for example, I
want to understand how I can

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
digest lunch. Well. Or how
yeast can digest the sugar.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Grind up yeast, fractionate it and
find some protein that's able to

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
digest the sugar all by itself
without the rest of the organism,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
an enzyme to do that. That's
the logic of biochemistry.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Genetics is the complimentary point
of view. Genetics is the study of

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
organisms minus one component.
Of course, what I mean by that are

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
mutants. The
geneticist who wants to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
understand the butterflies and how
the butterfly can fly would isolate

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
butterfly strains that have
lost the ability to fly.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And ideally one is extremely
closely related to the normal

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
butterfly, but for some reason,
ideally due to the mutation of a

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
single component they're now unable
to fly. And the geneticist would

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
then say, ah-ha, that
component must matter an awful

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
lot for the ability to fly because
the butterfly that lacks that

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
component cannot fly. It's
a totally complimentary point

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of view. And the
objects the geneticists

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
study in order to do that are genes.
Now, what is of course hard for you

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
guys to understand but will form a
structure for some of the lectures

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that I'm going to give over the
continuing part of this course,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
is that through most of the 20th
century the folks who studied

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
biochemistry and tried to understand
proteins and the folks who studied

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
genetics and tried to understand
mutants had nothing to say to each

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
other. They didn't
speak the same language.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They had nothing to relate to each
other by because there was no idea

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of how this gene stuff, which
started as a totally abstract

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
business, could possibly relate to
this protein stuff which started as

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
a very practical in the test-tube
thing. And they went for a very

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
long time as if they were just ships
sailing in the dark unaware of each

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
other. And I exaggerate,
but it's more true than not.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The great intellectual event was
the unification of these two points

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
of view through the discipline
of molecular biology.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Molecular biology was the
discipline that realized,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
oh, my goodness, these are
two different sides of the

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
same coin. That, in fact,
genes encode proteins,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
proteins are encoded by genes.
Ah-ha. This was a wonderful and

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
important thunder clap
in the 20th century. Now,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
it was a theoretical piece
of information at first.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The idea that genes and proteins
were related in this way was

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
abstract, very important, but
you couldn't do anything really

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with it, because it turned out
you couldn't actually work with

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
individual genes. The next
great revolution of the

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
20th century was a technological
revolution that let you actually

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
work with genes. And that
was the recombinant DNA

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
revolution in which the tools to
be able to study genes on their own

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
away from the organism, study
proteins, use genes to figure

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
out what protein they encode,
given a protein and figure out what

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the gene is, given a gene and
actually go in and make a mutant in

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
it, not wait for a random one to
rise in the lab but deliberately

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
knock it out, all of that
operationalized this intellectual

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
procedure, this intellectual
framework. So that is,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in some sense, a roadmap to coming
lectures that I'm going to give.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I'm going to talk about genetics,
I'm going to talk about molecular

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
biology, and I'm going to
talk about recombinant DNA.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That's the structure of the next
several weeks of this course.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And what I want you to do is to
recognize that although we're going

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
to dive down into the
individual components of it,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
everything we're going to do over
the coming weeks fits into this very

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
amazing intellectual framework.
And this is the intellectual

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
framework that you inherit as the
new students coming into this field

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and going into the 21st century
is all this was worked out

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
in the last century. You now
have an understanding of how

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
all these pieces fit together, or
at least you will, how these can

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
be used to study biological function
and, as I will also talk about,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the recombinant DNA has grown into
a world of genomics that has given us

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the complete picture of all of the
components. It's actually not bad.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You were very wise to have shown up
when you did because an awful lot of

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that groundwork has now been laid.
You know, if you would have come

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
along 50 years earlier, you
know, all that would have been

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
slogged through. Right
now you have this laid out

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
for you very nicely. And
that's sort of what the theme

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
will be. OK? I would ask
are there any questions,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but there should be a
zillion questions about that.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is just intended
as a framework there.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So let's now dive in.
Section 1. And I'll give a bit

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
more background today than I will
in some of the other lectures,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but we've got to get going. What
I really want to do first is talk

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
about, in fact, most of
today will be about Mendel.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I confess, Mendel is my hero. He
is one of my absolute heroes in

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
science. I just love Mendel.
And so I'll dwell on him a little

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
bit today. Now, here's
the problem with trying to

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
tell you about Mendel. You
already know about Mendel,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
right? Who here hasn't met Mendel
and the peas and the stuff and all

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that in their high school textbooks?
So what am I doing talking about

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Mendel today? Well, I think
what you learn about Mendel

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in the textbooks in high school
does not really bring out what really

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
went on with Mendel's thinking,
what's really important about those

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
experiments, what's
really interesting.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And so I want to ask you to put
aside what you think you know about

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Mendel and let's go back over
the setting of who Mendel was,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
what he was doing, how it all adds
up. Because I think in Mendel you

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
can find just the seeds
of how to do great science.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Now, for starters let me clear up,
I'll take five minutes to clear up,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
four minutes to clear up some
misconceptions about Mendel.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
It has generally been written that
Mendel was this monk working in this

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
monastery often in the Chez
Republic, at that point in the

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and
he was isolated, working by

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
himself, and it was amazing
he discovered all this stuff.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It's nonsense. Mendel working
on genetics was no accident.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It was the result of extraordinary
historical and economic forces over

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the course of about three
centuries that culminated Mendel.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Let me briefly explain why.
It starts with the Age of

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Exploration. Europe starts
sending out boats around the world,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
explorers to meet other parts
of the world in the 1500s.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
The boats come back. They
bring back stories of amazing

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
lands. They also bring back
odd plants, odd animals.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
People begin to look at
these plants and animals.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
They begin to cross them, grow
them and cross them, and look

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
at the weird odd combinations
of things that are going on.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And they say, wow, there's
so much more variation out

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in the world than we thought about.
Some of it's kind of useful. We

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
can make new kinds of varieties of
plants different than we had before,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
new kinds of varieties of apples.
Now, it turns out that's not just an

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
intellectual curiosity that that
was the case because economics was

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
changing in the face of Europe
in the 1600s and in the 1700s with

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
better transportation networks.
So if you happen to be able to make

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a better apple, it was
good, not just for your

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
family, but you would be able
to project that through lines of

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
distribution to larger markets.
It became economically sensible to

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
invest your efforts in producing a
better crop because you could sell

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
it to more people because unified
markets and transportation systems

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
were developing across Europe.
And, therefore, economic forces

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
began to work toward getting a
hold on the understanding of how you

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
could do better breeding.
Now, this turned out to be

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
particularly important to the
folks in Central Europe in the

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire, which
was the center of the textile

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
industry. They were
particularly concerned,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in the late 1700s, about the fact
that as the center of the textile

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
industry they had to be concerned
about the raw materials like wool

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that they used. Wool you
could get from Central

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Europe, the Spanish had begun
producing by breeding better sheep

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
with better wool. This
freaked out the guys in the

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire because they
were risking now losing this stuff

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to the Spanish because
of their better sheep.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And they began, around
1800, to say we better start

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
understanding how to do breeding.
They put together societies to

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
understand better the science
of inheritance and breeding.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
By 1820, a society which was
not about sheep but about plants,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
in fact, apples and grapes, the
Pomological and Enological Society

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of Braunau was organized.
Braunau being the capital of the

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire. And
this society got all the town

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
fathers of Braunau together. In
those days it was just fathers,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
you know. Together in Braunau and
started this society to encourage

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
the scientific study of agricultural
inheritance. They had this big

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
dinner and they were drinking and
things, and the speech is actually

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
written down where the
president gets up and says,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
"Some day the world may be as
indebted as it is to Isaac Newton

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
for physics. They may be as
indebted to the City of Braunau for

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
its contributions to inheritance."
Which is just eerie to read that in

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
1820 in setting up this society.
That was their high hopes for what

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
they would do.
In particular,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the president of this society,
one CF Nap was president of the

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
society as a side job, his
main job was he was head of the

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Augustinian monastery in Braunau.
So he began keeping an eye out for

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
bright young math and
physic students. Basically,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
you know, MIT kids coming out of
high schools. And he identified a

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
bunch of smart ones and attracted
them to the monastery and gave them

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
problems to work on. He
particularly was impressed with

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
this relatively poor kid,
Gregor Mendel, who had been

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
floundering around with a couple
of things, didn't have bright family

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
prospects, and attracted him to
the monastery to work on problems of

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
inheritance. So this was no
accident. This was a biotech

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
incubator that had been set up
in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Not of the sort we'd recognize
today, but it's just fascinating to

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
realize Mendel was not in a
vacuum at all. He knew what

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
he was doing here.
He really wanted,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
for the good of mankind,
to understand how to improve

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
inheritance. But why do
we celebrate Mendel today?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
We celebrate Mendel today
because he went about it,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
lots of people were interested
in this problem, right?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
You could probably find hundreds of
people who tried to do something on

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
this problem. Mendel was different
because he went about it as a

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
scientist. He went about it with a
rigor and a persistence unlike all

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
of his peers at the time. So
let's think about what it was

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
that Mendel did. So,
anyway, forgive me for the

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
historical digression, but
I think it's interesting.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
What did Mendel do? Mendel
started by taking peas.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Now, he went off to the market and
he got different varieties of peas.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And he brought back all of these
varieties of peas and he tried

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
growing them. Now, actually,
although I don't have the

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
records, I'm sure he
did lots more than peas.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He brought probably lots of
stuff and he tried growing it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And the first order of question
he wanted to ask is if I study

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
inheritance, I've got to start
with something that has constant

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
properties. This seems obvious
to you guys, but it was not at all

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
obvious at the time that the
most important thing you could do,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
if you wanted to understand the
transmission of traits and crosses

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and inheritance and all that,
is not to set up any crosses. It

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
was first to set up your
experimental system and make sure it

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
was rock solid. He probably
devoted years to getting

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
varieties of different plants,
and in particular settling on peas,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
with a property that when he
had peas with different traits,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
like whether or not the pea
seed was round or wrinkled,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
which will be some of our favorite
traits here, that when you simply

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
selfed this plant, crossed
it to itself and looked at

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
the next generation, it bred true.
Hard to emphasize how important that

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
was, but this was careful
experimental design.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So many biological
projects fail

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
because people don't take the
trouble to set up a system that's

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
rock solid. They set up a system
that's noisy and you're not really

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
sure you're going to be
able to interpret the data,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
etc. So Mendel did
that. Very good.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Always, no matter how long you
continued to breed these things,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
you continued to get round or
you continued to get wrinkled.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Now Mendel was ready. He
was ready to set up his first

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000
controlled cross.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So what he did was he took a
round pea and a wrinkled pea and he

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
crossed them together. Now,
that's again some serious work.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You first have to go along to one
of the peas, cut off its little

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
pollen producing organs so it
doesn't self-fertilize because peas

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
will self-fertilize. You've
got to cut them off early,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
make sure it doesn't get its own
pollen on it. Then you go over to

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
the other one with a paint brush,
you get some pollen and you paint

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
the pollen on the first plant.
That's how you set up the cross.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
If you screw it up you could have
self-fertilization or the wind could

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
carry some pollen from
something from somewhere else.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
So it had to be done very
carefully. He set it up.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And his first big-time
observation was? Now, again,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I know you know all this, so
feel free to chime in. In the

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
next generation all the peas were
round. We denote generations with

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
an F. F stands for filial meaning
children. We sometimes denote them

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
with a G for generation.
Anyway, I tend to use F,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
and most geneticists tend to use
F. The parental generation here is

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
called F0, the first generation is
called F1, the second generation F2,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
etc. So why was this a big
deal? This was a huge big deal.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
If you took a poll, a CNN Gallup
poll of Braunau at that time and you

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
ask voters what do you think would
happen if I cross a round pea to a

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
wrinkled pea, what do you think
the majority of voters would say?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Well, maybe half and half or
maybe all a little wrinkled,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
you know, a little puckered
or something like that.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
The notion that one trait would
be totally dominant over the other

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
trait was by no means the general
thinking. And you know what?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
It wasn't even the general case.
If you took plants, you guys must

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
know. If you take plants and you
cross them, the F1 usually looks

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
like some kind of a mix. It's
some kind of a blend between

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
the two. And, of course,
that's because you're

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
really looking at situations where
you're crossing things in which

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
zillions of different traits
are being inherited and

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
it's a hodgepodge. But
Mendel had a situation here

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
where he got an absolutely crisp
dominance of one trait over the

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
other. And so wrinkled completely
disappears, round dominates,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000
wrinkled disappears completely.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Now, next he does
another generation.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
He goes to the second generation.
And here he does this by selfing

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
this plant. That is he simply kind
of puts a bag over it and lets its

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
own pollen fertilize itself or he
takes a little brush and he brushes

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
its own pollen onto it. And
in the next generation his

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
remarkable thing was he saw
some rounds and some wrinkles.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:12.000
What was remarkable
about that?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Wrinkled came back. I
thought wrinkled was gone.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And it didn't come back in some
half-hearted way like a little

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
puckered. It came back fully,
totally, every bit as wrinkled as

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
the parental wrinkled. And
the rounds were every bit as

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
round. These were
discrete traits.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Wrinkled reappeared, and
it reappeared with no loss.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
No change in the phenotype, no
change in the appearance. And

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
that was very important because
at the time some of the predominant

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
models were blending of traits.
And you would never imagine, if I

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
were to take grape juice and water
and blend them together to get some

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
kind of pinkish thing that I would
be able to separate that back out

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
into clear water and
deep dark grape juice.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
But somehow this trait had appeared.
Thus, the trait was discrete. Big

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
difference. Big news. This
trait could be found still

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
lurking there. It was
merely hidden in the first

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
generation. Mendel did one other
thing, dear to my heart as someone

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
trained as a mathematician, he
counted. When he counted up the

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
rounds and the
wrinkles he found what?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Sorry? Three to one
round to wrinkled? No,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000
it's not. He found 5, 74 to
1,850. That's what he found.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Now, what do you
recognize about that?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Three to one? No, it's
not. It's 2.96 to one.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
It's not three to one. What's
this three to one business?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
[LAUGHTER] Why isn't there
a famous 2.96 to one rule?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
No, no, I'm serious. Mendel
did one more thing. He counted.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And then he did something
a little bit outrageous.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
He intuited. He said although
the data do not say three to one,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
notwithstanding your textbook, I
think the data are trying to tell

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
me it's three to one. [LAUGHTER]
This is part of science.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I'm sorry? Two sig figs, right.
You know, this is actually a

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
big deal because so many people are
unwilling to kind of look at their

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
data to say what's the
data trying to tell me?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And, of course, there are
so many people who are too

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
willing to look at their data and
say what's the data trying to tell

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
me? Because you can go off
the tracks in both directions.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So Mendel tried some experiments,
3.04 to one, 2.91 to one, etc. And

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
occasionally, yes?
No. How could he?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Nobody had done this. He
had no textbooks he could

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
consult. So do you think it's
possible he experimented with other

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
things that didn't show these
properties and said maybe these are

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
lousy traits to work on. I'm
getting such good results on

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
wrinkled, let's stay with wrinkled
for a while. That is an incredible

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
act of experimental judgment to
know that some problems are too

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
complicated, we'll come back to
them later. It's not cheating.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
You get to say this is
an interesting problem,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I'm going to work on it.
Not only that. I'll tell you,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
occasionally Mendel did these
experiments and he got completely

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
abhorrent results. They
didn't match three to one at

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
all. You know what he did? He
threw out the data. Do you know

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
why? No, not
small sample.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Large numbers. He's sitting
there in this garden.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
You know, I've actually
been to Mendel's monastery.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
He's in the garden in Braunau.
Remember, he's got to go cut off

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
the little pollen producing organs,
he's got to paint the stuff. What

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
if he screws up? What if
the wind blows and stuff

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
like that? If an experiment was
way off, he had to consider the

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
possibility that he just screwed up
because he hadn't gotten to it soon

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
enough and pollen had blown in
and had fertilized his plants.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Now, boy, that's a dangerous
thing to do, discarding data.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
But let's be honest.
Sometimes experiments screw up.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And if an experimentalist hasn't
got enough judgment to know that

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
sometimes you cannot believe
the data you also can go wrong.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
So Mendel, who sometimes is
accused for cheating for that,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
it's not at all cheating.
What you have to do is say,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
OK, I've got a problem here. I'm
going to redo this experiment a

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
bunch more times. I'm always
getting about this three

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
to one thing, but occasionally I get
something that's way off there and I

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
feel comfortable saying that's an
error. You can go wrong with that,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
but Mendel exercised very good
judgment in excluding that rather

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
than trying to muck this all
up by saying occasionally I

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
get something weird. So I
know the textbook summarizes

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
this beautiful 3:1 ratio,
but so much creativity. First

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
discipline of counting and
creativity of interpretation went

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
into all of this. So in
the modern world what would

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Mendel do? In the modern world,
upon seeing this three to one result

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
which he, I will note, he saw
for a couple of other traits.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Actually, what he did next
was he wanted to explain --

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
This was also part of his
brilliance. He made a model,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
the model of what was going on.
Mendel said how can I possibly

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
explain this beautiful observation
that for round and wrinkled,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
and for other traits, I observe an
approximately 3:1 ratio in the F0,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
F1 and F2 generations? Mendel,
my heart beats for Mendel. Oh.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
A mathematician he is. He
says let's make a very simple

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
model. Let's assume that there
are two factors of the control

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
inheritance of this trait. I'll
call them big R and little R.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
The round plants have big R and
big R. They have two copies of this

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
factor that controls shape. The
wrinkled plant has two copies

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
of the factor that control shape,
and the copy of the factor they get

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
is different. So the flavor here is
big R, the flavor here is little R.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
This has two copies,
this has two copies.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And let's assume that this plant
transmits one at random of its two

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
factors onto the next generation.
It will transmit a big R. Let's

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
assume that this transmits
one of the two at random.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
It will transmit a little R. And
that plant there in the middle

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
will be big R over little R.
And what will big R over little R

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
be as an appearance? How
does he know that that's going

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
to be round? Sorry?
From the result.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
He knows because that's what
happened. It's not an overwhelming

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
reason. But to make the
data work he's got to say,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
well, then this must be round.
OK? So no points for that. He's

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
just fitting the data. Then
here, when you self this,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
the two parental gametes
transmit either a big R,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
so we'll put it over here, big
R, big R, little R, little R,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
they transmit. And the
offspring are of that type.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
You can either get
that. Question there?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Could be. So he
had some knowledge.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
But, of course,
this is his model.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
He's entitled to make his model.
And you're saying he had good

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
reasons to think in these. So
everybody knows Mendel's model,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
right? So, now, in the modern world,
the minute you've got data like this

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
and you've got a model to
explain it, what do you do?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Publish. So Mendel, let's
put Mendel as a young

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
assistant professor who is all
fired up about these results,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
writes this up for publication in
Nature. It's a short thousand word

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
letter to Nature, let's
say. And he races it off,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
he emails it to the
offices of Nature in London.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Because he's in Europe,
he'll use the London office of

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Nature saying I have this amazing
result, I did these crosses.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Here are the results here. And I
have a model that explains the data

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
perfectly. What does Nature do?
Sorry? Why does it reject it?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Well, the first thing he does
is sends it out to referees,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
right? The way that scientific
publication works is it chooses two

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
or three anonymous referees. It
sends the paper out anonymously

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
to those two or three referees for
comment saying we've received this

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
interesting paper from
this young monk in Austria.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
What do you think about it?
Give us your opinions? Please

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
write back in two weeks,
etc. So you're the referees.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
You get Mendel's paper.
What do you advise Nature?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Publish or not? No. Why
not? It's outrageous.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Why? It's never been heard
of. Yeah, that's great.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
But, I mean, you sound like
a very conservative, you know,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
you cannot write that. You cannot
say it's wrong because it's never

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
been heard of.
Yeah? Regenerate.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
It would be wonderful if referees
could regenerate the result

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
themselves, but it's not practical.
For one thing, it takes a long time

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
to grow peas. They might
not have those strains of

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
peas. The best test really would
be independent replication of this,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
but unfortunately you cannot get
the referee to reproduce each result

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
before accepting the paper.
So you have to go on the own

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
internal results of the paper.
Has Mendel proved his case for this

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
model? How many people vote Mendel
has proved his case for the model?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
He's my hero. How many people vote
that he hasn't proved the case?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
How many people are conscience
abstainers? [LAUGHTER]

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
OK. Who says he hasn't
proved the case? Why? Exactly.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I mean, great, the model fits the
data. He had the data first and he

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
made a model to fit it.
Big deal. So you would say?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yes, he should be able to
make a variety of predictions.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
That would be a confirmation of a
model, at least the beginning of a

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
confirmation of a model is
he could make some predictions

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
based on a model. But
an ex post facto model to

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
explain the data you already have,
of course you're going to have one.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
It might be a little whacky, but
you always make a model to explain

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
your data. That's not the hard
thing. Now give me some predictions.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So, guys, give me some predictions.
We write back to Mendel saying we

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
find the author's work to be of
interest, it's a provocative and

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
unheard of finding, and
it's a fascinating model,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
but it is just a model. We'd like
to see some predictions verified.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So what would they
be? Sorry? Color.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Oh, show me more traits.
OK. Fine. We want to see more

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
traits. In addition to seeing some
more traits, and Mendel actually did

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
have more traits in the paper.
I'm just simplifying here. Prove

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
this model. What predictions would
you make if this model is correct?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Yes? Keep crossing them. So
tell me what you would do.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Please send him
instructions here.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
OK, so you would like me
to cross one of the rounds,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
an F2 round by a wrinkled.
What will happen in the next

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
generation?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
How do I do that? I
don't have DNA sequencing

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
available or anything, so.
[LAUGHTER] See what happens.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
So what might happen? What
is this round plant here?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
What might it be? And what
are the probabilities of

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
that?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
One-third of the time it will big
R, big R. Two-thirds of the time it

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
will be big R, little
R. If it is big R,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
big R then the offspring
will all be what? Round. If,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
on the other hand, it is
the case that that's big R,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
little R then the
offspring will all be?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
They won't be all anything.
They'll be half round, a 1:1 ratio

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
of round to wrinkled. OK?
That's an odd prediction that

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
a third of the time the offspring
from such crosses will all be round

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
and two-thirds of the time the
offspring will be 50/50 round and

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
wrinkled. You wouldn't
normally think of that,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
right? That's the kind of
thing that has to be done.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
And Mendel, of course, did
crosses like that. I simplified

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
here. This is really
what Mendel did was

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
demonstrated that all sorts of
predictions would be satisfied.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Another prediction that
Mendel could make, oops.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Which should be wrinkled?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Oh, my goodness. Oh,
wrinkle that pea. OK. Onward.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Thank you very much,
Claudette. That's good.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
So he made more and more predictions
like this. His predictions,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
for example, let's just take that
F1 pea, round over wrinkled here.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
If you cross this back with
wrinkled then it's pretty simply

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
because then always, if this
is an F1 as opposed to an F2,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
you're going to get a 50:50
ratio of round to wrinkled.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Moreover, these rounds, if
you cross them back, will still

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
give you a 50:50,
etc. That's science.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
That's the heart of science,
is being able to look at data,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
intuit what the data is trying to
tell you, build a model and test a

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
model. All of that is in Mendel.
OK? So I know you all know Mendel,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
but this Mendel really.
OK? Now, some definitions.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
I need to give you, so
Section 2, some definitions.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Because I've been skirting
around using some words here.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
OK? Number one, the word gene.
Gene is one of these factors of

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:59.000
inheritance
controlling a trait.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Mendel didn't use the word gene.
The word gene came along much later.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
The variant flavors of a gene,
big R and little R, are known as

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
alleles from the Greek word meaning
other. These are the alternative

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.000
forms of
a gene.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
It can come in the form big R,
little R. I might write big A,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
little A. I might write plus
for normal and M for mutant.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
There are a lot of different
notations geneticists use for that.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
The word phenotype means appearance.
The plant was round. The peas were

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:47.000
round. That's a phenotype.
The individual was 7" 7' tall.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.000
That's a phenotype. OK? Those are
phenotypes. Genotype means the pair

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000
of alleles carried
by the individual.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Big R, little
R is a genotype.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Big R, big R is a genotype. Little
R, little R. Those are genotypes.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
An important difference
between genotype and phenotype.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Other important words so that we
can actually talk to each other.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Homozygous or homozygote. A
homozygote is an individual who

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
has a genotype that has two of
the same alleles. Two copies of the

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
same allele, the individual
is said to be homozygous.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And, alternatively, an
individual is said to be

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.000
heterozygous, heterozygote
if they have two alternatives.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
A couple of other
important definitions.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Dominant.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
A phenotype round
is said to be

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
dominant over a phenotype wrinkled
if what? If the heterozygote shows

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
that phenotype, the
heterozygote between pure

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:39.000
breeding strains.
So phenotype one,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:53.000
pheno one is dominant over phenotype
two if the F1 of pure breeding

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
strains shows phenotype one.
Similarly, we have the word

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
recessive. Now, I'll
mention, and you will then

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
proceed to promptly forget,
because all of my colleagues forget,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
dominant and recessive do not refer
to alleles. Big R is not dominant.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Round is dominant. Big R is an
allele. Now, you say who cares?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
The textbooks get this wrong
all the time, it's true.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
You won't even find the
textbooks use this correctly.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
They will tell you
big R is dominant.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
What if it turned out that big R
controlled three different traits?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Maybe roundness. An ability to
grow with low salt in the soil.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
An ability to bloom in May. Some
of those traits might be recessive.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Some of them might be dominant.
We know examples of that,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
where the same allele can
control multiple traits,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
some of which show dominance,
some of which show recessiveness.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
So real card-carrying geneticists
try hard to use the word dominant

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
and recessive to refer to phenotypes,
not to alleles or genotypes.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Now, since 80% of the facility in
the Biology Department don't use the

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
word with that degree of precision,
I don't have high hope that you will

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
either. But I'm going to try to
say the words dominant and recessive

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
refer to phenotypes. OK?
This is a geneticists' kind of

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
hang-up. We all have our shtick,
but this one of mine, is that these

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
really do refer to phenotypes.
And it's quite important because

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
otherwise you could get quite
bollixed up. And I'll come to a

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
case with sickle cell anemia where
you won't be able to describe the

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
sickle cell anemia allele as
recessive, dominant or co-dominant.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
OK? Good. Those are some
definitions. They're worth knowing.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
If we get those definitions
right the rest of it is pretty

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:53.000
easy.
All right.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
So Mendel publishes this
paper in 1865. It's accepted.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
It appears not in Nature but in
the proceeding the Royal Academy of

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Braunau and it's
published. And what happens?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Nothing. It sinks like a stone.
Mendel's paper is totally ignored.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Nobody really pays any attention
to it. This paper was sent to many

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
people. Charles Darwin has a copy
of Mendel's papers in his files.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
But, in those days,
the way printing worked,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
in order to read a book you
had to slit the pages open.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Darwin never slit the
pages of Mendel's paper,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
so it's pretty clear he never read
the paper, even though it had the

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
answer to much of what he
wanted to know about evolution.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
No one really read Mendel's paper
because it was so far ahead of its

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
time, it just was pretty strange.
It had all these concepts. And,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
anyway, you could always dismiss it
with that kiss of death of biology

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
"it's just the model". Right?
You can kill things with

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
"it's just the model". People
were just not prepared to

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
deal with Mendel.
So Mendel, in fact,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
poor Mendel, maybe he had
a good time, I don't think,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
instead didn't really do much more
on this topic of genetics per se.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
He became an administrator.
Became abbot of the monastery and

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
did other things.
Worked on meteorology,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
etc. And we don't really hear from
Mendel again. So what really begins

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
to reignite interest in this is the
understanding in the late 1800s of

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
chromosomes. Very briefly,
cytologists, people studying cells

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
in the microscope.
Cytologists are folks who study

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
cells. They noticed
these very funny little

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:42.000
structures in cells. They
noticed these structures that

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:50.000
when you stain then with a
dye would stain very funny.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.000
They picked up dye in a certain way.
And they noticed that they had this

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000
very interesting choreography that
when a cell underwent mitosis these

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000
funny things would divide down the
midline and these little x-shaped

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
structures would go to the
two daughter cells like this.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
That is these Xs
would become single

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
individual pieces. Again,
you know about these things.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
They had no clue what these were.
What is the appropriate scientific

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
procedure when you have no clue what
something is? You need to give it a

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
name that somewhat covers up the
fact that you have no clue what

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
you're talking about because it
sounds much better than just saying

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
they are "these funny things".
And so they were referred to as

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
chromosomes, meaning literally
colored things. [LAUGHTER]

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000
You need to
understand these sorts

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
of things. OK? So
these chromosomes here,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
these colored things, for lack
of any other knowledge of them,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
that was the property they
could be given. Chromosomes.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Look it up. They executed this
very interesting choreography during

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
mitosis. That is cell division.
Oh, boy, is that going to be noisy.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Someone should
shoot it and put it

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
out of its misery.
[LAUGHTER] All right.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
But what they then noticed was the
following. And we're going to run

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
just a couple of minutes over.
I'm going to keep it short. But

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
they noticed that when organisms
made sperm and eggs rather than

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
normal cell division, they
noticed that these chromosomes,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
instead of all of them lining up
on the midline, lined up in pairs.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
And the pairs underwent
a series of two divisions.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
There was a first division which
we call meiosis one in which --

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:26.000
-- one copy of each
of these Xs went

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
to each daughter cell. Very
different than mitosis where

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000
the Xs would be split down the
middle. Then a second division

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:47.000
occurred, meiosis two. And
in that each of the daughter

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:57.000
cells now the
X is divided.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
And they got that.
This one looked,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
for all the world, like
mitosis. But instead,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
at the end of the day instead of
ending up with four chromosomes,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
here we end up with only two
chromosomes in each gamete,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
sperm or eggs. And what
happened was from this pair,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
one member of the pair was selected.
Now, this is either producing sperm

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
or eggs. When a sperm
like that came together

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
with an egg like that and
fertilization occurred,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
you get back to four chromosomes.
You all know this. You learned

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
this in high school. But the
important point about this

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000
was that people said, ha,
things lining up in pairs,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
one copy of each going to the
offspring, then a copy from mom and

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
a copy from dad restoring the pair.
Sounds just like what that dead monk

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
was talking about. [LAUGHTER]
It was just the reason

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
people really didn't think much of
Mendel's paper was because it was so

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
abstract. What were these genes?
He didn't point to anything. There

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
was nothing concrete. And
folks hate that. By contrast

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
they now began to see things and
vaguely remembered that this was

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
just like what Mendel's story was
about. And three different groups

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
around the world began to redo
this work on crosses and all that.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
And wonderfully in 1900 three groups
simultaneously published papers

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
about this. Now, Mendel's
Law is rediscovered.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Now, the explanation here. How
does the cytological observations

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
about meiosis explain Mendel's
laws of inheritance of traits?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Very simply. All you have to
imagine is that big R is being

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
carried on one of these chromosomes.
Little R on the other one.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And then half the offspring had big
R, half the offspring had little R.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
All of Mendel's laws can be
implemented by simply assuming that

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
genes and the alleles of those
genes live on these chromosomes.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
So it's beautiful, except for one
problem. You may remember from your

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
high schools that Mendel also had
another law about more than one

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
trait, pairs of traits.
Not just that we have this

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
segregations of alleles away for
one trait. What was his law about two

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
traits? We'll go over this next
time. What was his law about two

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
traits, like round and
wrinkled and green and yellow?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
That they would be inherited
independently of each other.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
How would that fit into this model?
Different chromosomes. They'd be

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
on different chromosomes. But
what if I had three traits?

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Eventually, if I had, now, peas
actually have seven pairs of

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
chromosomes. So if I
study eight traits in peas,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
two would have to lie on the same
chromosomes. So then the chromosome

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
model would contradict independent
inheritance. So either Mendel

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
cannot be right with this other law
of independent inheritance that you

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
learned about or the Chromosome
Theory cannot be right of these

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
living on these physical molecules
and getting distributed that way.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Right? So we have a deep
problem because either Mendel,

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
my hero, is wrong or this
chromosome model is wrong.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And the problem is we don't have
enough time to resolve this today,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
so we're going to have to come
back on Wednesday and figure

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
out what happens.

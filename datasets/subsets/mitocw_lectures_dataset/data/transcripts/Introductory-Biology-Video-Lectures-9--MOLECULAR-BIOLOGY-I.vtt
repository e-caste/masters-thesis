00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So today we're going to continue our
focus on DNA which I'm personally

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
enthusiastic about at least in terms
of being such a fascinating molecule.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I told you the story last time
of how we actually came to

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
understand that DNA was the genetic
material.  And I still see comments

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that, oh, God,
all this stuff is not relevant to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the exam.  We're trying to construct
the exams in ways that test whether

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you got the concepts and not just
whether you memorized every term

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that you ran into in the textbook.
So I'm hoping that you will see some

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
greater purpose in why I'm trying to
talk about some of this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And also I'm sure some of you will
forget the details of transformation,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of DNA replication we're going to go
into as we sort of burrow into it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
over the next lecture or so,
but what I am hoping you may

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
remember ten years from now,
even those who don't go in biology,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is how experiments are done, how
real people do them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And that was partly what I was
trying to tell you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And you guys are pretty good at
figuring out the basic principle

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that someone had to somehow show
that a DNA molecule in one organism

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
could change some organism to have a
new characteristic.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And as I sort of told you with the
work from Frederick Griffith.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And then his initial stuff wasn't
devoted to that at all.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It was trying to solve a very
pressing problem which is dealing

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
with pneumonia in a pre-antibiotic
era.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then the finding that he got,
that this odd result that something

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in a heat-killed extract could be
transferred to a live bacterium sort

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
of set things up for Avery and his
colleagues after a number of years

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of work to make a very powerful
argument that DNA was the genetic

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
material.  But,
as I said at the end of last lecture,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that paper was published
in the 1940s.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And people didn't immediately say oh,
wow, DNA is the genetic material.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Often, and we'll see it again with
genetics, there's sometimes sort of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the body of science the average
person thinks about.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Science needs to reach to a certain
state before an idea can take hold,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
even if there's evidence supporting
it.  Part of the problem was that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
chemists had isolated DNA.
And the way they used to isolate DNA

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
was really rough on it.
Crack the cells open.  And what

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
happened, it would all get broken
down into little pieces of DNA.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And people had worked out the basic
chemical structure that it was the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
deoxyribose and how the things were
joined together,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but nobody had ever seen anything
more than just these little pieces

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
of DNA.  And there was a widely held
conception that it was just an

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
anonymous tetranucleotide
of G, A, T and C.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It wasn't clear why the cells made
it, but it didn't look like anything

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that could encode information.
Whereas, as I said, something like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
proteins, those seem to be very
different.  And so the world wasn't

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
quite ready for it.
Another thing, and this came from

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
one of the comments here,
was someone said they didn't know

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
bacteria could take up DNA from the
environment.  And,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in fact, most bacteria can.
It happens that streptacoccucci and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
some other bacteria at certain
phases in their lifetime develop

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
this capacity to take up
DNA from the outside.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Given what I've told you about a
membrane and how hard it is to get

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
things across it,
you could imagine it's not trivial

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to get a DNA molecule which is huge
from one side to the other.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So it doesn't normally happen.
And what happens if you go into a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
lab and you're cloning something or
other, and we'll talk about how to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
take a couple pieces of DNA and join
them together in a test tube and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
then put them back
into a bacterium.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
If we put it into E.
coli that doesn't normally take up

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
DNA you'll find that it's sort of
basically black magic.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You cook them up with some divalent
cations at very high concentrations,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
you do temperature shifts and
various things,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
or you give them a big jolt of
electricity, and the next thing you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
know you get some DNA inside.
And it's not a very efficient

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
process, but all you need is one
molecule to get in one bacterium and

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
then you're in business.
So that was another reason that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
this wasn't accepted right away.
Because this was not a phenomenon

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that could easily be repeated with
other bacteria.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So it looked like it was something
perhaps special to streptococcus.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And what did really change people's
understanding,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
or at least bring people to the
understanding that DNA could

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
possibly be the genetic material
came about from the discovery of the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
actual structure of --
How the structure of DNA as a long

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
molecule with complimentary strands
and the double helix,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
the little pictures I showed you
with the base pairs,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
which you know about,
and how the two strands which now

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm going to start emphasizing run
in opposite directions.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We'll come back to that in a little
bit, but the 5 prime to 3 prime

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
direction is this way on one end and
5 to 3 on the other.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And just remember back here that
there's the 5 prime carbon and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that's the 3 prime carbon.
So this is the 5 to 3 prime

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
direction of the strand.
And then it twists up in

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
3-dimensional space to form this
double helix.  And you've seen that

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
movie several times.
So once that structure was

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
discovered then people began to see
how these could possibly encode

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
information.  It was clearly not
just a tetranucleotide

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of G, A, T, Cs.
But we didn't move immediately to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that understanding.
And today, again sort of trying to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
show you how biological experiments
are done and how they're done by

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
real people, I want to just go on
and tell you the key things that

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
happened next.
So someone who was very struck by

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
the results of Avery when they came
out was Erwin Chargaff who was at

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Columbia.  And,
in fact, my colleague Boris

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Magasanik whose office is next to
mine was a post-doc

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
in Chargaff's lab.
So I've got a neighbor of mine who

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
worked with Chargaff.
And Chargaff was very struck by

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
this result from Avery and his
colleagues that you could take DNA

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and put it in another organism.
And here are a couple of quotes

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
from his writing.
One that I'd liked.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I've sort of had a sense of this in
my own research career,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
this kind of thing.  ìI saw before
me in dark contours the beginning of

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
a grammar of biology.î
He didn't really know quite how it

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
worked but he sort of sensed that
someone here where you could get

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
down to the language that biology
was written.  So he started some

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
experiments.  And I started with the
conviction that if different DNA

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
species exhibited different
biological activities there should

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
exist chemically demonstrable
differences between deoxyribonucleic

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
acids.  So he was able to start just
doing some simple chemical

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
experiments to try and look at DNAs
from a whole variety of sources and

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
see what he could learn.
And this was not at the structural

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
level.  This was just at the
chemical level.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But one thing he learned was that
the base content of DNA,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that's the A, G, C, T part of it
varied widely between organisms.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So this was what Chargaff found in

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
his lab, key findings.
And that was important because if

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
DNA was just a molecule of GATC,
just a tetranucleotide that every

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
organism made then you'd expect to
find the same base composition in

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
all organisms.
He didn't, so that finding

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
essentially buried the monotonous
tetranucleotide hypothesis.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Another thing he found was that DNA
was the same in different

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
tissues --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000
-- from the same organism --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000
-- but the proteins varied.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And that's a characteristic you'd
expect of something that was the

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
genetic information from the cell
that all cells have to have sort of

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the major blueprint.
And if you had, even though

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
proteins look like an attractive
possibility for that because they

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
had so much variation,
this kind of finding wasn't

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
consistent with it and it supported
the idea that DNA was the

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
genetic material.
Well, the other thing he could do

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
was he could measure the ATG and C
content of all these different DNAs.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And he noticed some similarities
then.  And he extracted out of that

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
a couple of generalizations.
One was that if you looked at the

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
ratio of the purines,
those are the ones with the two

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
rings, adenosine and guanidine over
the pyrimidines,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
those are the ones with the single
ring which were C and T,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
there are about one.
Another thing he noticed was that

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the ratio of A to T was about one
and the ratio of G to C was about

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
one.  Now, that was an important
clue but it didn't lead to any

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
immediate breakthrough,
even though maybe now that you know

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the structure you can see,
gee, if I had been there maybe I

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
would have been smart enough to jump
on that number.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So instead the work that led to the
structure of DNA now introduces a

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
couple of other characters who
you've heard of a lot,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Jim Watson and Francis Crick.
At the time that Avery made his

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
discovery reporting DNA was
transformation,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and Jim Watson described himself
later as a precocious college boy in

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Chicago who was consumed
by ornithology.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So he was into bird watching.
That's what he was excited about at

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the time Avery did his experiment.
And Francis Crick at that point was

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
a physicist, and he was in the
British Navy designing Navel mines.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So that's where those two players
were at the time of Avery's results.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So then both Francis Crick and Jim
Watson ended up in Cambridge,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
England about 1950.
I think Crick got there around 1949

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and Jim Watson got there in 1951.
Francis Crick was a grad student,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
35 years old at the time.  I'll show
you pictures in a minute.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
35 years old at the time and still
working on his PhD.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So he was a pretty elderly grad
student, if you want to think of it

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that way.  And Jim Watson
was a young hot-shot.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
He had done his PhD working with
Salvador Luria who was at Indiana

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
University at the time.
Salvador Luria was one of the Nobel

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Laureates at MIT.
He founded the Cancer Center,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
which is still here right across
from the main biology building.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And Jim was a very, very bright and
brash young guy,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and he had done his PhD with Salva
and then he went to Cambridge as

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
well.  And the reason they both went
to Cambridge was they were attracted

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
by the power of x-ray
crystallography.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Now, I said a little work about that
earlier, that if you take x-rays and

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
you bounce them off a crystal and
then measure the diffraction pattern

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
you can work backwards by Fourier
transforms and whatnot to figure out

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
what the underlying crystal
structure is.  For the purposes of

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
this course the mechanics of how
that's done, we don't have to worry

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
about that right now.
You just need to know that you can

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
work backwards from the diffraction
pattern to figure out what the

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
underlying structure was.
And I told you,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
when I introduced to proteins,
that the first clues that there were

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
these regions of secondary structure,
alpha helices and beta sheets came

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
because people saw characteristic
reflections in these diffraction

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
patterns of certain proteins.
And I also told you the story of

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
how Linus Pauling had gone to Oxford,
had gotten sick and tired of reading

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
detective novels,
started to try and explain the

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
refractions in a certain class of
proteins and came up with a model

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
for the alpha helix.
And so that was the sort of thing

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that inspired Watson and Crick.
They were both interested in when

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
one could get the structure of DNA.
Now, Cambridge also had a very good

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
x-ray crystallogram group.
And just in passing it's

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
interesting as to why they didn't
come up with the structure of the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
alpha helix.  There were two things.
One was just lack of basic

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
knowledge.
I told you that the peptide bond,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
if you remember I emphasized that
you cannot rotate it because the

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
electrons are distributed.
Pauling was an outstanding chemist.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He knew that fact.  And the folks
at Cambridge who were doing that

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
didn't learn this until later,
so their models were far less

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
constrained because they could have
rotation around that bond.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And the other one was just an
experimental thing that the size of

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the photographic plates they used in
the Cambridge lab were too small in

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the sense that they missed a key
reflection that Pauling knew about

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and they didn't know about.
So this combination led to them

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
being scooped by the other group.
But nevertheless the group at

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Cambridge was absolutely outstanding
and at one of the top places in the

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
world to do.  And I showed you a
couple of pictures when I was

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
showing you the transition state.
Sort of what you get out of working

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
backwards from these diffraction
patterns is they can measure regions

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
of electron density,
and then you fit atoms or fit

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
molecules to the patterns that you
see.  And if it's all working you

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
can explain why there are bumps here.
There's an oxygen here and so on.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
There's another one.  This is an
ATP that's bound actually in a

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
pocket in a protein.
But you can sort of see how

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
beautifully the patterns of electron
density deduced from the x-ray

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
crystallography will match the
chemical structures that we put on

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
the board.  So that was the idea,
they were going to work out the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
structure of DNA.
Now, the thing about Watson and

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Crick, who at this point looked like
this, they didn't look inordinately

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
distinguished.
In fact, Jim probably looked like,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
you've probably seen people who look
approximately like that around MIT.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
He would have fit in right here and
no one would have noticed.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
They were not actually x-ray
crystallographers.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
They were just trying to model
other people's data.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And the best DNA crystallography
data was a young woman Roselyn

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Franklin who was working in London.
A very somewhat uneasy alliance with

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Maurice Wilkins.
And in trying to read the history

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
it's a bit complicated because,
at least some of what I've read,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I think that when Roslyn Franklin
arrived at the lab she was told this

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
DNA structure problem was hers.
And Maurice Wilkins in whose lab

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
she was working was told that he was
sort of working for her.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So there was a bunch of confusion
in this.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
But, in any case,
Roslyn Franklin was collecting

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
crystallographic data.
And Watson and Crick located some

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
distance away in Cambridge were
trying to come up with models that

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
could explain the structure of DNA.
And they learned about Roslyn's

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
data.  And it was here data that
they used to work out the basis,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
her crystallographic data that they
used when they put together

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
their structure.
So if it hadn't been for her they

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
wouldn't have been able to make
their discovery.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
So part of the reason I'm dwelling
on this is I think their discovery

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
of the structure of DNA was arguably
one of the great intellectual

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
advances of our time.
It just opened doors.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
The whole field of molecular
biology became possible once people

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
suddenly saw that DNA was
complimentary strands.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
You could almost immediately see
how you could copy genetic

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
information.
It laid the groundwork for what

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
later turned out to be,
you know, recombinant DNA and

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
everything else.
So much of this pivots around this

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
one discovery.
And I think I wouldn't be doing

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
justice to this finding,
which you all have heard about for

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
years and years,
if I had let you walk away from here

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
thinking this was too young geniuses
who sat down in a room with some

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
crystallographic data and emerged
with a structure that sort of

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
changed the course of the
study of biology.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And, as you can see,
changes our society and everything

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
else.  There are a couple of
accounts of this,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
there are numerous accounts.
One that I found pretty interesting

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
is called ìThe Eighth Day of
Creation,î if you ever want to read

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
an interesting book on science.
This was Horace Judson's effort to

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
try and put together a history of
this happening.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And with all history he's
ultimately --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
You know, there are some judgment
calls by the historian,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
but this one certainly he tried to
be pretty fair-handed and

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
even-handed and he tried to get at
the heart of what was going on.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Watson wrote a book called ìThe
Double Helixî.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Jim Watson's a very colorful
character, quite brash particularly

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
when he was younger,
and that's reflected in this book.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
It's an interesting read.  Probably
more balanced point of view for sure

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
in ìThe Eighth Day of Creationî.
And there are now a lot of other

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
books.  But what I did,
just to try and do this in about a

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
minute or two,
was I took a couple of the key

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
things that happened during their
adventure of trying to work out the

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
structure of DNA and just kind of
ran some of their missteps together,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
because even though this was a
marvelous discovery it just didn't

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
happen.  So they started out,
they were inspired by Linus

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Pauling's discovery of
the alpha helix.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And I don't know if you can remember
the story, but what Pauling decided

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
to do when he was lying in bed and
with a strip of paper trying to work

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
out the structure that was giving
these reflections in the crystal

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
structure, he said I'm going to
start by ignoring the side chains.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So that was a brilliant move in the
case of the alpha helix because he

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
was then able to figure out that
that hydrogen bond between the

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
carbonyl and the amino group,
you could see how if you got helix

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
going it would repeat at exactly the
way that would give the reflections

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
that were observed in
the crystallography.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So that was how Watson and Crick
sort of did it.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Linus Pauling had shown the way.
So they decided they would ignore

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
the side chains of DNA.
So they started out by saying we

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
won't consider the ATs,
the Gs and the Cs.  Well,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
given what you know about the
structure of DNA that was not a

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
helpful move in trying to work out
the structure of DNA.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Another thing,
for example, that happened was that

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Jim Watson has no lack of
self-confidence.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And so it turned out when he went
to hear scientific talks he didn't

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
take notes.  And so he went to hear
a talk on x-ray crystallography

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
given by Roslyn Franklin,
but he didn't quite remember the

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
numbers right.
He got the facts a little jumbled,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and he and Francis spent a while
trying to design models to data that

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
wasn't the right data.
It was just not quite remembered

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
right, so there was kind of an
inefficiency there.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And then Jim had a bias almost to
the end that the phosphate backbones

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
they knew would somehow be on the
inside and the bases would be on the

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
outside of the structure.
So if that's your sort of starting

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
place then it's sort of hard.
So Watson, excuse me,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Francis Crick was beginning to
suspect that maybe the bases were

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
important.  So he hired a young
mathematician.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And he said, ìCan you see if you
could work out whether there would

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
be any chemical attraction between
any pairs of bases?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And the young mathematician came
back and said that he thought G

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
might go with C and A with T.
And given what happened here you

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
might have thought that a light bulb
would have gone off,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
but it didn't.  And, in fact,
Chargaff visited them and the light

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
bulb went off for nobody.
And, in fact, Chargaff wasn't a

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
terribly big fan of what Watson and
Crick were trying to do.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
So the pieces are piling up but
still not there.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Then a big experimental advance
came from Roslyn Franklin.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And that was she discovered that the
DNA that they had been diffracting

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
was actually a mixture of two forms.
So there were actually two

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
structures in the mix that were
contributing to the diffractions.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
She was able to separate out the
two kinds of DNA,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
DNA-A and DNA-B she called it.
And so now this gave a much clearer

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
diffraction pattern,
and that's the diffraction pattern

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
that she saw.
And Watson and Crick managed to get

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
a look at this data.
And it's a little complicated how

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
that happened,
but Crick realized almost right away

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
that there were two strands running
in opposite directions.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So he know knew it was 5 to 3 in
one direction and 5 to 3 in the

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
other direction like that.
So you might have thought they were

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
home-free, but no.
Jim Watson immediately built a

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
model that paired like with like,
A with A, T with T, G with G.  They

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
wrote it up and they were ready to
submit the paper.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And they gave a presentation to
their colleagues at the lab in

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Cambridge.  And they were shot down.
And one of the key things was they

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
learned the chemical fact that most
of the textbooks were wrong at that

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
time in the way that they depicted
the structure of guanine.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
If you look in your textbook,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:58.000
excuse me, here.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
So if you were to look in a textbook
today you'd see guanine like this,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
but there is another way you could
draw this.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:23.000
So this you may remember when we

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
were talking about
phosphoenolpyruvate that this is an

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
enol form and this is a keto form.
And this is the way most of the

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
textbooks were showing guanine at
the time.  So they were looking at

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
the structure of guanine in
textbooks.  And if you were trying

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
to work out schemes for putting
bases together you can see what's

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
going on up here would be very
different.  And if we have a

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
hydrogen here versus if we have an
oxygen, if you're trying to say make

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
hydrogen bonds at that particular
position, I think all of you

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
understand hydrogen bonds well
enough to see how that

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
would throw you off.
So once that insight came,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
once they learned that then the rest
of the structure came pretty fast.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And there's a movie about this.
One of the nice things in it was

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
sort of trying to recreate the
experience where I think it was

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Watson who was shuffling these base
pairs around.  And he suddenly

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
realized that you could set up base
pairs with A and T and with G and C,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
and when you looked at them you
could see they were geometrically

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
exactly the same shape.
You could just take the shape of the

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
G and C pair and lay it right down
on the A and T pair.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And then you could see how you
could build either a G-C or an A-T

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
pair into the repeating structure of
this DNA and it would be compatible.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
So they built a model and they
thought, we can just hit the lights

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000
for a second here maybe.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I just want you to see what that
first model looked like.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
It looks like something you could
hack together in a chemistry lab.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
They had the bases cut out of metal.
And you can see just,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
you know, here the retort sort of
stands using chemistry and various

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
clamps that you would use for
clamping a flask or something if

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
you're doing a chemical lab.
That's the stuff that they were

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
using to put the model together.
And they published then a paper in

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Nature that told about this result.
That's the entire paper reporting

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
the structure of DNA.
And maybe you can see there's a

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
little hand-drawn double helix right
there that captures the elements.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
That is the paper, and that was in
the journal Nature.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And it had in it, right near the
end, one of the coyest sentences in

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
the scientific literature.
They didn't want to go into all the

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
details that if you had an A paired
with G and G paired with a C and you

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
pulled them apart then you could
replicate the molecule by redoing it.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So all they said was,
ìIt has not escaped our notice that

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
the specific pairings we
expostulated immediately suggests a

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
copying mechanism for DNA.
So this is a picture of Jim Watson

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
wearing short pants at Cold Spring
Harbor in 1953 reporting

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
this structure of DNA.
Cold Spring Harbor is on Long Island.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
It's been one of the Meccas for
molecule biology since the 1940s.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
They have a famous symposium once a
year.  The topic changes every year

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
and rarely repeats.
And it was at one of those symposia

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
--
This was the year that they

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
discovered the structure of DNA.
And there was Watson.  So two years

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
ago they had another meeting,
a special meeting just exactly this

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
time of year.  It was in February
within a couple of days of right now.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
So I gave this lecture and I showed
the student in the class that this

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
year, I said here's a picture of Jim
Watson displaying the structure.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
They're having a meeting 50 years
later in 2003.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And I'm going down there.
I'm asked to give a talk.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
And I'll come back and I'll tell
you what it was like.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
So I gave my lecture.
I dashed out to the airport.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I hoped on the plane.  I went down
and I registered.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
They gave me, you know,
the stuff to get into my room,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
a little envelope with the key card
and things.  And I went up to my

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
room.  And I took out the key card.
And what did I find myself looking

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
at?  The same picture I had shown to
the class just a couple

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
of hours earlier.
Here's another picture of Jim the

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
way he looked at the time when he
made this amazing discovery.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
That's Salvador Luria who I
mentioned.  I tell you about him in

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
a subsequent lecture.
I was at another meeting a few

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
years earlier where some of the
old-timers were razzing each other,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
and someone showed this picture.
And then they got up and they gave

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
it a title.  And that was ìPicture
of a Man Picking His Own Pocketsî.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
So they would tease each other a lot.
And I'm hoping maybe you'll get a

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
chance to hear a little bit
more about that soon.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
This is what Jim Watson looks like
now.  I asked to get a picture taken

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
just so you could see he's still
around and is very active and still

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
very controversial.
This doesn't make much of a

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
difference.  Here's a picture of
Watson and Crick a little bit later

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
just sitting out on a porch in Cold
Spring Harbor.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
It's sort of right on the edge of a
bay down there in a very relaxed

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
kind of atmosphere that still
permeates molecule biology

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
research to this day.
Francis Crick just died last July at

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
the age of 88,
so we've just lost the link to one

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
of the two people who did this
amazing experiment.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
OK.  So I want to then set things
up for the details of DNA

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
replication.  So there was a basic
principle that came across from this

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
that you could see how this could
work, that DNA was sort of like

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
having a photograph and a negative.
And so the information is actually

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
in there twice.
It's just in different forms.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
And when I tell you about DNA
repair in another lecture you can

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
maybe see already how useful that is
because if you damage one strand

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
you're not really out of luck
because you've still got the

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
information in the other strand.
And you could probably,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
on the basis of that, device a
repair strategy if you thought about

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
it.  But more importantly for DNA
replication finally gave an insight

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
to this thing that had been vexing
people forever.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000
If you had to have all this
information for making a cell,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
and every time a cell divided and
you saw how it can happen pretty

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
quickly with something like a
bacterium of yeast,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:25.000
how could you accurately copy all
that DNA, excuse me,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
all that genetic information?
How is it stored?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.000
How could it be done?
And once you saw ah, it's just a
matter of separating the strands,
and if there's an A there put a T
there, if there's a C you put a G
and so on, was a huge breakthrough.
But that then didn't tell people
how DNA replicated or even if this

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.000
is the mechanism.
You can actually come up with all
kinds of models for how you could
replicate things based on this
principle, including crisscrossing
between strands and all
sorts of things.
The predominant model and perhaps

00:32:43.000 --> 00:33:07.000
the simplest one was called
semi-conservative.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And it thought of the problem in

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
this kind of way,
that if you had two strands of the

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
original DNA molecule and then you
pulled them apart that one of the

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
strands here would become one of the
strands of the daughter,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
and then the new one would be here
and the same thing would happen on

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
the other side.
And then if you did it again this

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
thing would happen again with a new
strand.  This time the skinny strand

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
here would be like this,
the skinny strand here would be like

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
this, and then this one again.
We'd have one that was nearly

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
synthesized plus one of the
originals.  So this model was one of

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
the simplest because it kept this
strand intact throughout the whole

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
process while some of the other
models had them being patched back

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
together, all based on the idea that
A pairs with T and G pairs with C.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
But proving that this was the
correct model was then another

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
important advance.
And that was done by Frank Stahl and

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Matt Meselson.
Actually, I think I'll skip this

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
for right now.
Matt is a professor up at Harvard,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
just up at Harvard Square not very
far from here,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
still very active.
Frank Stahl is a professor out in

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Oregon.  He's still active.
So one of the differences about

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
this course is a lot of the things
I'm telling you about --

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
And this is pretty old stuff right
now, right, molecule biology.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
The people who did these are still
around and very active.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
This is most of modern biology is a
pretty young scientist,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
and many of the major characters are
still running around and with us

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
today.  So, anyway,
what Matt and Frank were at Caltech.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And they with a bunch of other

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
students had an apartment.
And they were sitting around trying

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
to work out a way to figure out this
model.  And they came up with an

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
idea, and that was to see if you
could differentially label what we

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
might call ìold DNAî and the ìnew
DNAî here.  And since it's

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
chemically the same stuff it's a bit
of a trick.  How do you tell old DNA

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
from new DNA?
So their idea was since nitrogen

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
comes in two different isotopes,
N14 which is the common one and N15

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000
with is one mass heavier,
that maybe you could start out with

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
the DNA, for example,
grown in N15.  And then when you

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
started replication switch to N14.
And then you'd be able to tell,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
if you could separate these
molecules on the basis of their

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
density since the one with the N15
would be heavier than the one with

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
the N14, then maybe you could work
this out.  And the story goes,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
this has been written, they were
sitting arguing about this,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
or talking about this idea at the
table.  And it was a good idea but

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
there was a problem.
And that was how could you separate

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
the two kinds of DNA based
on their density?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
So they had a piece of fingernail
and they were trying to see whether

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
they could get it to float by
dissolving more and more sugar.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
And they figured if they added more
and more sugar the water would get

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
denser and denser so the could float
the fingernail.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And they weren't able to do it.
But all chemists made a periodic,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
probably some places here at MIT,
they had a periodic chart right in

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
their living room.
So they went and they looked.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
And then they looked at sodium.
And they went down the periodic

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
table and then they saw cesium.
And thought maybe,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
you know, if you took a solution of
cesium chloride and you put it a

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
centrifuge and you spun really hard
then you'd get a gradient of varying

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
concentrations,
of slightly different concentrations

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
of cesium chloride.
And that they could tune that to a

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
range that would discriminate
between the heavy and the lighter

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
forms of DNA.  So the experiment
they did is known as the

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Meselson-Stahl experiment.
But, as I say, these are names that

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
come from real people.
And the idea was pretty simple.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
They grew the bacteria for many
generations --

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000
-- in N15 medium.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
This is the so-called heavy

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000
or H isotope --

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
-- of nitrogen.
And then that time equals zero in

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
their experiment,
when they're ready to start the

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
experiment they switched to medium
with N14, which we'll think of as

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:09.000
the light or the L isotope.
And then they isolated DNA --

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:21.000
-- after let's say increasing rounds

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:31.000
of replication that you could tell
simply by measuring how much DNA was

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:41.000
in your bacterial culture when the
bacteria had doubled their DNA.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
And this is the data they got which
looks something like this.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
In fact, in this case the
blackboard representation is pretty

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
close.  So this is cesium chloride.
And it has been centrifuged very

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
hard so that there's a gradient now
that's light at the top and a little

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
heavier at the bottom
of the gradient.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
There's a little more cesium
chloride per mil here then there is

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
there in the tube.
And I'll just give us three little

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
sort of reference marks here.
So what they found when they

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
started was that all of the DNA was
at that position down

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
at the heavy end.
And then this is after one

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:40.000
generation.  So the DNA has now
doubled.  What they found was that

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:49.000
all the DNA was now at this
intermediate position.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:58.000
And after two generations or two DNA

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000
replications they now found that
some of the DNA was here,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000
some of the DNA was there.
And if they went to three or more

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000
what they saw was they began to pile
stuff up there.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
And I think most of you could
probably make the connection between

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
that data and that picture that I've
got up there.  This is

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
the heavy-heavy DNA.
This is the heavy-light.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
So this would be heavy-heavy,
heavy-light, light-heavy.  After one

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
round it will all be here.
After two we have heavy-light,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
but this one is light-light,
light-light, light-heavy.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And so now we've got light-light,
the heavy-light, no heavy-heavy is

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
ever going to show up again.
And the longer you do this the more

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
you'll get the light accumulating.
A very simple experiment done by

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
real people but enormously powerful
because now it showed that this

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
basic idea, you have the photograph
and negative, you pull them apart

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
and copy them was right.
So at this point you begin to see

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
why data of Avery's that before
people had trouble accepting,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
all of a sudden now it was really
you needed a CYD and A was

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
the genetic material.
And this is what sort of ushered in

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
this great burst of molecular
biology.  So in the next lecture

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
what we're going to start doing now
is once you, this is all great,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
but once we start figuring out how
to replicate it we're going to have

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
to get down to enzymes and
biochemical steps.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And there are some formidable
challenges to replicating DNA,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
and it's also awesome.  I'll tell
you at the beginning of next lecture

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
how much DNA we have and just
how accurate it is.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
It always blows me away.
I'll see you then.  Take care.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.400
JOHN DOLHUN: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.460
Welcome to The Ellen Swallow
Richards lab part two.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.920
There is-- the room will
be a little bit more

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.660
sparsely populated today.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.010
I wonder why.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.540
Lab reports are due, right?

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.400
So we're going to get started.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.970
And I'm going to start off by
talking about probably the most

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.040
important parameter in measuring
the health of the river,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.030
and that's the dissolved
oxygen. So when

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.080
we look at the dissolved
oxygen concentrations

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.820
out there, for a river
to really be healthy,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.700
we're looking for something
greater than probably about 8

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.200
PPM.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.960
If the concentrations
fall down to 5 or less,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.620
then you'll start to see the
fish move around erratically,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.470
because they're trying
to get their oxygen.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:33.950
So less than or equal to
5, and we have some stress

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.200
placed on the aquatic life.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.630
If the dissolved
oxygen concentration

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.457
goes below 2, even
for an hour or two,

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:49.790
you're going to have fish kills.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.150
So let's take a
moment to actually see

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.030
how this oxygen
gets into the water,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.920
and this is the big picture.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.350
So if you look at this, you've
got two processes going on.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.860
You've got the oxygen coming
in from the atmosphere,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.610
and it's diffusing
into the water system.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.650
You also have down below, you've
got aerobic biodegradation

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.670
taking place.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:38.830
So we've got oxygen
diffusing into the water,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.200
and then we've got
aerobic biodegradation.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.070
These are the two main
processes that are taking place,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.600
and both of these
processes are going--

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.100
they have different kinetics,
yet they're coupled together,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.720
coupled in the sense that if
aerobic biodegradation uses up

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.400
the oxygen, more oxygen
will start to dissolve in.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.740
There's a transfer
driving force that

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.500
actually lets more oxygen
dissolve into the water.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.630
The rate at which
oxygen is dissolving

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.280
is actually proportional
to the deficit of oxygen

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.600
that's in the river.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:50.750
And that deficit is equal
to the equilibrium level

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.250
that we would expect
minus the actual level

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.750
that we actually find.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.210
So the amounts of oxygen
that we're talking about

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.430
are very tiny.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.490
And there was a
brilliant chemist

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:29.750
by the name of William Henry,
who actually, back in 1803,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.270
came out with Henry's Law.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.680
And what Henry's Law
says is very simple.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:58.420
The solubility of a dissolved
gas in a body of water

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.480
is proportional to
the partial pressure

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.880
of that gas over the water.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.020
There's even a Henry's
Law constant here,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.750
and there are tables of these.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.280
There are thousands of them.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.510
For every solvent, for every
gas, for every temperature

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.570
combination that
you can think of,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.150
there is a Henry Law constant
that you can plug in.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.330
Let's think about, what
is the partial pressure

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.190
of oxygen on any given day?

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.380
How do we calculate that?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.150
Yes, yeah.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.810
Alec.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.580
AUDIENCE: So if you
have total pressure,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.920
and then you know the
makeup of the atmosphere.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.120
You can just break it down.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.200
So say your pressure
is 1 atmosphere

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.690
and you have 20% oxygen in
the at-- that's not right.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.910
But 20% oxygen in
the atmosphere,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.333
your oxygen would be
contributing 0.20 atmospheres

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:04.500
to the pressure [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.580
JOHN DOLHUN: Very good.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.960
Very good, Alec.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.340
So Alec said that you've got
20.9% oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.630
So we can convert
that to a decimal.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.240
Partial pressure of
oxygen on any given day

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.050
would be the percent
of oxygen that's

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.660
in the atmosphere times
the atmospheric pressure

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.620
on that particular day minus
the pressure of the water vapor

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.060
that we're talking about.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.375
So that gives us
a handle on this.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.940
I want to show you
probably the simplest

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.550
example of Henry's Law.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:54.360
I brought a bottle of Coke
here, and these are hard, right,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.830
because they pack them--

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.970
there's a head of carbon
dioxide gas over the liquid.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.120
Now when I open this, I'm
going to release the gas,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.770
so the partial pressure of
CO2 over this liquid is gone.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.650
We should start to see bubbles
coming out of the solution,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.459
right?

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.040
[HISSING]

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.700
Oh good, it's not an
explosive one, so that's good.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.840
So there are the bubbles of
the dissolved carbon dioxide

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.970
gas starting to come out.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.050
And that's a simple
example of Henry's Law.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.615
Can anybody think of a
more complex example?

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.480
Anybody a diver here?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.500
Kelly, you're a diver?

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.167
AUDIENCE: Oh, no,
I'm just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.980
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.800
When you--

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.440
It's like the bends, right?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.910
Because as you go down
further, the pressure

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.560
increases so that more nitrogen
can dissolve in your blood,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.170
you said?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.460
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah, very good.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.715
Yeah, so you've got
gases in your blood.

00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:09.090
And when you go
down, when you're

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.310
diving down under
a great pressure,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.590
when you start your ascent,
all of those gas bubbles

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.210
are going to come out.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.470
And they have to go somewhere.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.930
They could migrate
anywhere in your body,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.090
and it could cause a rash.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.560
It could cause some
type of joint pain.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.840
You could end up with
paralysis, even death.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.510
So divers have to really,
really time their ascent.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.039
That there's a name for that.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.690
Kelly said the bends.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.194
That's one of the names.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.615
It's also called DCS,
Decompression Sickness.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.060
That's a great example
of Henry's Law.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.370
What about if we think about
temperature and dissolved

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.840
oxygen?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.910
Let's actually take
a look at that.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.100
Here is a graph of oxygen
concentration and temperature.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.690
What stands out to you here?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.210
Sean?

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.780
AUDIENCE: It decreases
exponentially with temperature.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.820
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah, as
the water is warming up,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.580
look what's happening
to the dissolved oxygen.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.486
Why do you think
that's happening?

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.040
And why, when the water is
cold, can we hold so much oxygen

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.180
in that cold water?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.930
Kelly.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.750
AUDIENCE: Is it because, as
the temperature increases,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.245
the average kinetic
energy of the molecules

00:10:08.245 --> 00:10:10.910
increases, and the
distribution broadens,

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:16.040
so more oxygen has
the ability to escape?

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.195
JOHN DOLHUN: Good, good.

00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:20.870
As the temperature increases,
the kinetic energy of the water

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.240
molecules is
increasing, and they're

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.360
starting-- think about
when you boil water.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.790
Bam, they're bubbling out.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.400
That hydrogen bonding
network is gone.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.910
All those intermolecular
forces of attraction are gone.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.350
Now think about this side when
the water gets really cold

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:45.170
and you form this
hydrogen bonding network.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.300
I mean, it expands, right?

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.200
Pipes break.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.550
That's why our pipes break.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.775
It's because of the hydrogen
bonding in the ice crystals

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:54.410
when they expand out.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.150
But look at the crevices
here in these things.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.580
So the oxygen molecules can
swim in and out of those,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.880
and they can become weakly
trapped and pinned in.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.700
And there you've got
a dramatic increase

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.020
in the amount of oxygen that can
dissolve in the colder waters.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.960
The other thing to keep in mind
about the water is the heat

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.660
capacity of water
is much greater

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.090
than the heat capacity of air.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.700
It takes a lot more
energy to change

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.750
the temperature of water.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.625
I mean, you can--

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.890
I've gone out when
it's 85 degrees,

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.830
and I want to go for a
swim across from my house.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.190
And I jump in, and
it's only 67 in there.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.820
So the water hasn't caught up
to the temperature of the air.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:54.270
Now there are a lot of
different equations out there

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.120
that actually would
let us calculate

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.430
the potential of a body of water
to hold oxygen, theoretically,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.320
how much could be out
there on a given day.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.860
And the more complex
the equation,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.660
the better the results.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.840
I found a couple
empirical, simple equations

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.280
that give really good results,
so I'm going to go with these.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.700
And they're all based on
altitude and temperature.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.940
If you look at
the equation, it's

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.980
all about the
atmospheric pressure,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.840
the water vapor pressure, and
the temperature of the water,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.880
which is in Celsius.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.750
So if we look at that
equation, if the pressure,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.150
the atmospheric
pressure goes up, right,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.130
what happens to the dissolved
oxygen concentration?

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.110
If you're trying to
calculate the saturated level

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.070
of dissolved oxygen, and
the pressure goes up,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.870
the atmospheric
pressure, what happens

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.370
to the DO concentration?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.140
I promise this is
not a trick question.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.372
This is-- Alec.

00:13:12.372 --> 00:13:13.330
AUDIENCE: It increases.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.250
JOHN DOLHUN: It
absolutely increases.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.150
Yeah.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.880
Now what happens if we
have a high water vapor

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.700
pressure that day?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.010
You might be on a
mountaintop stream.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.730
Water vapor pressure
is very high.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.890
What happens to the DO?

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:31.910
Someone?

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.840
AUDIENCE: Decreases.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.100
JOHN DOLHUN: Sam, decreases.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.870
Good.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.190
And the other situation, which
if the river temperature is

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.520
high, then it's
intuitive, right?

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.620
Your DO is going to be smaller.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.870
So that's how you
use those equations.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.910
And then what you can
do with the equation

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.560
is you can calculate a thing
called the percent saturation

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:05.020
level, which is the actual DO
that you get in the lab divided

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.670
by the potential of
water to hold oxygen

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.520
based on the temperature
and pressure above.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.350
And that saturated
level is going

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.910
to tell us a lot about the
condition of the water.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.440
Usually-- I mean, you could
have from 90% to 110%,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.400
something like that.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.540
That's normal.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.920
If you get to 120%
or greater, that's

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.950
a problem, because there
are different diseases

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.270
that the fish can--

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.955
they have an oxygen bubble
disease fish can get

00:14:37.955 --> 00:14:40.146
if it becomes too saturated.

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:44.800
So this is something that
you'll do these calculations,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.580
and the TAs will
carry a pH meter.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.040
They'll record the
air temperature,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.670
the atmospheric
pressure, the river water

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.560
temperature each
day you go down,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.930
and they'll put that
on the whiteboard.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.450
Here is some simple
data that will

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.340
allow you to
interpolate the water

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.660
vapor pressures based
on temperatures.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.490
And you can go in
between these, and you'll

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.410
get very good results.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.230
If you can't find it on here,
you could use this equation.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.190
But the T here is the
temperature of air,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.350
and it's in Kelvin.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.510
And back here, this
is the temperature

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.470
of the river in Celsius.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.200
So don't get confused with that.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.050
And now I'd like to spend
a few minutes talking

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:42.440
about the actual method that
we're going to use in this lab.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.690
This method was
actually discovered

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:55.500
by a graduate student by the
name of Winkler back in 1888.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.890
And the method has
withstood time.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:03.000
What he did is he developed this
series of oxidation reduction

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.090
equations to actually
measure the dissolved oxygen

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.300
concentration in saltwater.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.360
And he came up with this
series of equations.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.740
And it's been 130 years,
and this is still here.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.550
Today they have the fancy
dissolved oxygen meters,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.260
which we're not using,
but you can just

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.500
drop it in and get your DO.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.940
They used this method to
calibrate those meters today.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.440
So you're using--
you're going to be

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.660
doing the real chemistry here.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.740
The whole method is
based on that if you've

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.730
got oxygen in the
water, iodide is

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.850
going to get oxidized
to iodine, and you're

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.410
going to be able to titrate the
iodine with sodium thiosulfate.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:59.150
So let's just go through the
method just a little bit here.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.720
So we start with
manganese sulfate,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.660
and we form a white precipitate.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.560
But if oxygen is
present in the water,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.740
oxygen is an
oxidizing agent here.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.150
It's going to oxidize
this manganese hydroxide

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:21.560
to this tetravalent
manganic species.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.170
So you've got manganese over
here, which is a plus 2,

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.210
and over here,
you've got a plus 4.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.140
There are a couple--

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.210
in the literature, there's
some argument about this.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.070
Some people feel the
species is a trivalent,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.780
and they're saying it's MnOH3.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:48.720
So on this side, you'd have a
trivalent manganese species.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.720
Other people are
saying no, it's MnO2.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.435
It's a hydrated form of mnO2.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.820
It's tetravalent.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.850
What I've done is I've
combined both these

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.290
to give you this manganic
species here, which works.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.690
This is tetravalent.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.060
So notice that when
you've formed this,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.330
this is like a brown flock.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.370
You've captured the
oxygen at this point.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:24.290
Now you've got to dissolve
that, so we add sulfuric acid

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.290
to dissolve that
brown precipitate.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.890
And then there's
iodide in there.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:40.430
So this oxidized manganese
will oxidize iodide to iodine.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.180
We can then detect it
with sodium thiosulfate,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:49.250
and the iodine gets reduced
back down to iodide.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.510
If you look at this, for every
oxygen, every one oxygen,

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.920
you make to manganic species.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.770
Each manganic species
gives you one I2,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.580
and each I2 requires
two thiosulfate.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:15.410
So that's a 4 to 1 ratio,
thiosulfate to oxygen.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.580
So let's take a look at
your first day, which

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.290
is the standardization
of the thiosulfate.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.470
We have to know exactly what
the concentration of that

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:31.380
is when we titrate the river
water to actually get-- to home

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.880
in on the exact concentration.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.830
So we're going to be using a
primary standard, potassium

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:39.330
biiodate.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.650
Does anybody know what the
qualities of a primary standard

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.150
are?

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.190
When you pick a
primary standard,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.330
it's pretty important.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.910
You want something that
has certain properties.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.935
Anybody ever worked
with a primary standard?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.490
No?

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:19.305
OK, well, first thing,
notice how big this is.

00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:22.020
It has a very high
formula weight.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.585
So that's actually a good thing.

00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:28.820
Not all primary
standards have that.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.650
When you mass it
out, you're going

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.530
to have less error on
the balance because

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.630
of the mass of this thing.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.190
Also, it has to be
something that's pure.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.650
And this is like 99.9% pure.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.470
The other thing is
you need something

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.800
that does not have any
water vapor attached,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.810
no attached water.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.300
The TAs put this in the oven.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.090
So no hydrated water.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.610
And then the final
thing is, you want--

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.510
it should be stable at room
temperature and when heated.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.640
And oftentimes we'll
look at the cost, too.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.448
That's another factor
that comes into play.

00:21:28.448 --> 00:21:29.990
But what you're
going to do is you're

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:34.950
going to weigh out
0.0818 grams of this.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.400
And if you divide by the
molecular weight of that,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.200
you'll get moles.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.030
And you're going to
make a 100-mil solution.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.170
So divide that by 0.1
liters, and you'll

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.120
get your concentration.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.760
You're actually making up
something like a 0.0021 molar

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.060
solution of that standard.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.550
And then you're going to
use that to standardize

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.390
your thiosulfate.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.120
We're also going to be using
starch in this reaction.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.020
So why do you think
we need to use starch

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.083
when we're titrating something?

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.620
Alec.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.310
AUDIENCE: Starch
reacts with iodide,

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.460
and it creates the
blue color so that when

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.435
we react-- when
we were titrating,

00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:26.670
it could turn really pale.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.030
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.655
AUDIENCE: So it was really hard
to tell if it was clear or not.

00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:31.830
So I think the starch helps
indicate whether or not

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.020
you've gotten rid of
all of the iodide.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.010
Iodide, yeah.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:35.760
JOHN DOLHUN: Good.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.070
Good.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.800
That's very good.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.860
So starch actually reacts
with iodide and iodine,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.300
gives you that blue-black color.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.050
So if you're titrating
something yellow to clear,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.270
sometimes it might
be harder to see.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:54.370
So what Alec said
was your solution

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.650
actually reacts with starch.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.590
So I actually brought some
of the solution in here,

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.420
and I brought a
piece of bread in.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.430
I don't know if this
is going to work,

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.300
but bread has starch
in it, doesn't it?

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.630
So I'm going to put
someone on this bread.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.560
Wow.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.080
Look at that blue black.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.850
So something's going on here.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.720
It's reacting with
the starch, right?

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.390
Can I have a volunteer?

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.730
Some brave person?

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.740
I know you're all
tired, but one of you.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.580
One of you, come up.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.170
Come on up, Maida.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.460
Maida, right?

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.170
It's Maida, right?

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:39.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.160
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.570
Maida, stand up front here.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.130
So what we're going to do is
we're going to open this up.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.000
And put a pair of
these on, Maida.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.340
And I'm going to let
you hold this beaker

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.650
and face your fellow students.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.230
And just hold it nice and--

00:24:05.834 --> 00:24:07.380
and what we're
going to do is we're

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.330
going to add something to it.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.020
It's clear, right?

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.920
OK, keep your eye on the beaker.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.590
Maida, don't drop
but whatever you do.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.860
AUDIENCE: I won't drop it.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.527
JOHN DOLHUN: OK.

00:24:17.527 --> 00:24:18.350
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.580
OK.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.617
So keep your eye on that beaker.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.770
Don't take your
eyes off the beaker.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.395
Now what-- don't worry.

00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:41.860
Keep watching it, Maida.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.610
Don't get nervous.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.890
Oh!

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.120
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.430
You see that?

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.660
This is what we're
talking about.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.450
And I mean, you're titrating.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.620
You can't see the end point.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.400
You put this in, now that
last drop of titrant,

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.410
it's going to turn it clear.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.725
You're going to be able
to see your titration.

00:25:00.725 --> 00:25:03.030
And thank you very much, Maida.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.920
So what's going on
with the starch?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.500
Let's take a look at this.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:20.170
Starch is made up of
about 25% amylose, which

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.050
is the linear helical form.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.920
And it also is made up about
75% of the branched amylopectin.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.455
What happens is we have
iodine and iodide present

00:25:34.455 --> 00:25:39.520
in our solution, and when
those two come together,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.590
they actually form
this pentaiodide anion.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:50.980
So you've got some
I2, some I minus.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.650
Remember, I2 is amber.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.600
I minus is clear.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.660
When you get these
two together and they

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.700
insert into this helix, the
amylose helix of starch,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.560
and what amylose does is it
forces the pentaiodide anion

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.930
to go in linearly
into that helix.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.390
Then the energy spacings change.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.350
So you've got-- the way the
wavelength of light hits

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.540
that, you're going
to see blue black.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.140
It's all happening inside of
the starch with the amylose.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.640
That's the key thing.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.210
There are different people--

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.280
some people still
believe it's I3 minus.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.560
There's somebody else out
there saying no, no, it's

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.600
a polyiodide.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.170
There's always going to be
some controversy in the--

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.270
but they're working on it.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.010
I like I5.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:50.310
And someone actually
made an inorganic complex

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.920
to make it look like starch,
and they proved it was I5.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.720
But even after this
paper came out,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.120
there's still a lot
of controversy, so.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.687
So for your standardization,
pretty simple.

00:27:07.687 --> 00:27:09.270
You're going to go
through, and you're

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.920
going to just
follow these steps.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.250
The TAs will go through
this with you, very simple.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.740
And you're going to
start off with probably

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:22.650
something like this, kind
of like a reddish solution.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:29.520
And then you're going to
start adding your thiosulfate.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.980
And gradually, your titrating
the iodine in this solution

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.780
to iodide.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.205
So here you've got a
more yellow solution.

00:27:41.725 --> 00:27:46.780
What you want to do is you want
to find a spot when it turns

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.580
yellow to add your starch.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.540
And the starch has to be
bubbly hot on the hot plate.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.150
And if you add it
too early, there's

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.920
so much iodine in
there, it's going

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.200
to destroy the starch complex.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.420
You won't get a reaction.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.365
But if you wait until it's
so pale yellow, what happens,

00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:10.865
Thomas?

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.850
AUDIENCE: It turns blue.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.990
It makes the complex
successfully,

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.670
it turns it dark blue.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.040
JOHN DOLHUN: It
turns it dark blue.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.730
Yeah.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.087
But if you wait
too long, right--

00:28:23.087 --> 00:28:25.670
AUDIENCE: [? I ?] [? mean, ?]
if you add too much, [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.620
JOHN DOLHUN: Did you--

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.970
you had a reaction
yesterday where your starch

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.680
was an globules, right?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.550
Is that--

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.502
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:35.862
It formed a film because
we didn't keep it hot.

00:28:35.862 --> 00:28:37.820
JOHN DOLHUN: Oh, the
starch was not hot enough.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.580
OK, that explains that.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:40.970
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.943
AUDIENCE: We put
it in and stirred,

00:28:41.943 --> 00:28:44.900
and it made a bunch of little
blue specks that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.220
JOHN DOLHUN: Yes, yes.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.730
Yeah, I've seen that before.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:52.850
So you want to keep your starch
hot, and just be patient.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.020
And then you just take a
plastic pasture pipette,

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.660
take a swig of it,
shoot it in, and you

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.610
should get your blue black.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.570
And then look.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.120
You've got your blue black.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.730
You put that last drop
of thiosulfate in,

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.440
and you've got your
clear solution.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.440
So you turn around, and
you're writing this down

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.970
in your notebooks, right,
and then you look back,

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.460
but it's starting to
turn blue black again.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.440
What should you do?

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.350
What would you do?

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.322
AUDIENCE: Add another
drop of titrant.

00:29:31.322 --> 00:29:33.030
JOHN DOLHUN: Add
another drop of titrant.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.070
That's what I would do, Thomas.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.200
But it's not correct.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.950
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.742
JOHN DOLHUN: But I
would do the same thing.

00:29:38.742 --> 00:29:40.440
I would add another
drop of titrant.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.930
AUDIENCE: Oh, what if it
just turned blue by itself,

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.555
[INAUDIBLE] and you're
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:43.555 --> 00:29:46.410
JOHN DOLHUN: There's a side
reaction going on in the air.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.510
When you get this
clear, you've got

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.250
all iodide present in there.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.290
But what happens is--

00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:00.010
so you've got iodide
there, but you also

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.450
have oxygen in the air.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:15.090
And the oxygen is oxidizing
the iodide to iodine,

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:18.450
and we don't want this
iodine coming from the air.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.610
We want it only from
the river water,

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.950
right, from the
oxygen in the river.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.330
So this is a side reaction that
can go on if you let it set.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.010
So just ignore it.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:35.670
Just take your end point,
your final neutralization,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.040
and you're good.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.800
Take a look at the
stoichiometry here.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.575
One biiodate make six I2.

00:30:45.575 --> 00:30:50.020
Each I2 reacts with
two thiosulfate.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:55.715
So it's 12 to 1
thiosulfate to biiodate.

00:30:55.715 --> 00:30:57.090
What you're going
to do is you're

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.140
going to do three trials,
and they all should agree to

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.360
within 2% or 3%.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.780
If they don't, do an
extra trial or two.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.880
And what you're
going to do is you're

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.730
going to find your mean,
your standard deviation,

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.370
and your confidence
intervals and then give all

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.530
that information to your TA.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.690
Yesterday the TAs
did a beautiful job.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.690
They put everybody's on
an Excel spreadsheet,

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.650
had it all averaged out.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.020
They really did a
good job yesterday.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.270
The students really homed in
on the exact concentration

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.690
of the thiosulfate.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.400
So it's pretty simple.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.460
You do your calculations
right there in the lab.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.970
And then you have a choice
of using the class average

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.960
or using your own results for
the dissolved oxygen that will

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.340
take place on the next day.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.020
So collection of water samples.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.680
So you're going to be going
to the river for day two.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.500
And we have these poles.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:06.160
If you have long arms,
you'll take a short poll.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.690
If you're short and
have short arms,

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.490
then we have real long poles.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.770
They're like hockey sticks.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.980
So you get your stick, and what
you do is you insert your--

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.830
your BOD bottle snaps into
the clip that I've got inside.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.130
You take the stopper
out, and then you

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:26.900
go to the edge of the dock.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:32.150
Don't fall in, and
don't push anybody, OK.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.080
Remember the cyanobacteria
and all that out there.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.900
And take gloves with
you, because when

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.740
you put this under water, it's
got to be completely submerged.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.780
You have to reach over the dock.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.060
You've got to stopper
it underwater.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.910
So you've got to have
gloves with you, all right.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.040
So I stoppered mine underwater.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.500
I bring it up, take it out,
and then I look at the--

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.400
I take the bottle,
and I do this test.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.410
I don't see any bubbles.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.070
That's a good sign.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.870
That means it's perfect.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.340
If you see bubbles, you've
introduced more oxygen

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.120
in there.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.030
Your DO concentrations
are going to be too high.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.980
Pour it out, and restart again.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.980
OK, so that's the collection.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.850
Then you bring the
stuff back to the lab,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:28.352
and you're going to treat
the bottles in the lab.

00:33:28.352 --> 00:33:31.790
This here is wrong.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.450
You don't want to use these
digital pipetters to treat

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.250
the water, because you'll
be introducing oxygen

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.640
into those water bottles.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.440
What you're going to use is
your 10-mL glass pipette.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.670
And what we're
going to do here is

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.300
each pair of students
will have four bottles.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.620
So you're going to--

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.730
first, you're going to treat it
with the manganese sulfate, 2

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.140
mLs of manganese sulfate.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.710
That's the first reaction
on that oxidation reduction

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.600
Winkler series.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.790
And the way you do it
is-- what I would do

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:12.170
is I would take up 10
mils of manganese sulfate

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.310
to prevent any airflow, any air.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.060
And then what you're
going to do is you're

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.010
going to take the stopper out.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.580
You're going to go just below
the surface of the liquid

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.679
and put in 2 mils.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.600
And then your partner
can stopper it.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.679
You go to the next one.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.540
You do all four of them.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.500
The last 2 mils in here,
shoot it into waste.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.219
And then do the same thing
with the alkaline-iodide-azide

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:40.040
reagent, 2 mils in each bottle.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.989
And you should look at
the bottle at this point.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.730
After you add those
reagents, there

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.010
should not be any bubbles.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.460
If there's a bubble, it
means you've introduced air,

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.660
and your DO values will
be higher by doing that.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:04.250
So once you've treated with
these two steps here, you've

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.560
essentially trapped
the oxygen. You're

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.080
going to have this
brown flock like this.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.000
Now you just shake that
a bit, and then you're

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.930
going to dissolve it now
by adding sulfuric acid, 28

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.730
drops of sulfuric.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.670
Acid for the sulfuric, you
don't go below the surface.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.330
You just open the lid,
and you drip, drip it in.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.320
The acid is heavy.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.290
It's going to fall right to
the bottom of the bottle.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:35.970
And now you should
have a bubble in there.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.730
You will have a bubble
after you add the sulfuric,

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.260
and that's OK.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.120
So when you're done with
this, you're ready to titrate.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.710
And we've got to-- we're
supposed to titrate 200 mils.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.980
That's what you titrated when
you did your standardization as

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.650
well.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:36:00.460
But we've got to make
up for the 4 mils

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.370
that we added there
in the beginning.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.700
We've displaced something there.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:11.160
So you want to titrate
200 mLs times--

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:18.000
you've got a 300 mL BOD bottle,
and you've taken and added

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.810
4 mLs of stuff to it.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.500
So if you do the math
to make up for that,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.780
you really have to
titrate 203 mLs.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.850
So there's a couple
ways you could do this.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:36.980
You can use a 100-mL graduated
cylinder, and the error on that

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.950
is about plus or minus 0.5.

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:44.280
You fill that up twice,
put that in your container.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.410
The last 3 mils, you could
use this for accuracy

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:53.430
to get your last 3 mLs
in, and then you're good.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.890
But you can also
just titrate 200 mLs

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.420
and then multiply your answer
by a correction factor, which

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.980
would be 203 over 200.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:19.100
And that will give you the same
answer as titrating the 203.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.070
So the math is
pretty simple here.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.220
You're converting the
moles of your titrant

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.910
to moles of oxygen,
grams of oxygen.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.520
You divide by the liters.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.260
If you're doing 200
mLs, that's 0.2 liters.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.360
And then you get your
milligrams per liter in PPM.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.960
I kept mentioning
we're using the--

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.170
we've got to add this
alkaline-azide solution.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.410
We're actually using
the azide modification

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.710
of the Winkler method.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.860
And what is that?

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:09.280
Well, there are NOx
gases in the atmosphere.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.940
What's the nastiest NOx
gas that you can think of?

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.780
I'll give you a hint.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:33.581
It's a big greenhouse
gas, and it's not CO2.

00:38:33.581 --> 00:38:35.330
AUDIENCE: Ozone?

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.270
JOHN DOLHUN: Ozone is
a gas up there, yeah.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.610
But that protects us.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:45.550
Our ozone layer is a
layer of protection.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.690
But what's-- yes.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.375
AUDIENCE: Is it NO2 or--

00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:51.500
JOHN DOLHUN: The other way.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.310
AUDIENCE: Or N O?

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.550
I know that [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.410
JOHN DOLHUN: All right,
please don't laugh at this.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.710
It's laughing gas, N2O.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.830
You're all-- I
mean, the atmosphere

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.220
is loaded with laughing gas.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.980
I know.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.440
Everybody's laughing now.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.640
It's great.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.430
Where does it come from, N2O?

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.440
All the fertilizer.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.560
1% of all the
fertilizer in the world

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.290
goes up in the atmosphere
as laughing gas.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.270
It's not from a
dentist's office.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.550
It's from fertilizer.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.940
I know.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.770
I don't want to
think about dentists.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.360
I was just at one yesterday.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.880
I don't like dentists.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:41.240
But every ton of laughing
gas that's in the atmosphere.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.280
is like 300 tons of CO2.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.860
And it stays up there
for over 100 years.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.350
And what does it do?

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:59.000
Well, who said ozone back there?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.780
There you are.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.190
OK.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.120
Laughing gas reacts
with ozone, and it

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.590
forms dinitrogen dioxide.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.570
And this dinitrogen dioxide
only lasts for about an hour.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:27.090
And immediately, the N2O2
reacts with air and water

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.080
to form nitrites.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.110
And here we are talking about
greenhouse gas in the world,

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.730
and this is affecting our little
tiny reaction in the Charles

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:49.320
River experiment, because these
nitrites, look what they do.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.280
They get in and oxidize
iodide to iodine.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.590
And we don't want
our iodine coming

00:40:55.590 --> 00:41:00.510
from some reaction from laughing
gas, right, from nitrite.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.750
We want it coming from
the oxygen in the river.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.870
So we add sodium azide.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:10.110
And that zaps the
nitrites, convert them

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.320
to harmless nitrogen and water.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:19.010
So that's the theory
behind why we're

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.990
using the azide modification.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.210
All that for these nitrites.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:33.290
So let's talk for a moment
about pH, pH in natural waters.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.613
Let's see here.

00:41:34.613 --> 00:41:36.545
Pulling down some board, here.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.430
Who knows the definition of pH?

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:56.185
Remember your chemical
principles from a long time a--

00:41:56.185 --> 00:41:56.685
Alec.

00:41:56.685 --> 00:41:59.760
AUDIENCE: I think it was log
of concentration of hydrogen

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.822
ions, [INAUDIBLE] ions.

00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:01.780
JOHN DOLHUN: Very good.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.590
The negative log of the
concentration of the hydrogen

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.716
ions.

00:42:05.716 --> 00:42:06.216
So pH.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.230
And I mean, you all know
the pH scale is 0 to 14,

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:19.020
and acid is less than 7.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.410
And I hope you know what color
litmus paper changes, right,

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:22.915
with pH.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.970
That was a question on a
TV show with Regis Philbin,

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.890
You Want to Be a Millionaire.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:36.290
A guy actually got up to
the million dollar question.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:40.430
And I happened to turn
it on just at that point,

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.080
and they ask him,
what color does

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.470
litmus paper change in base?

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.590
And the guy said,
oh, I don't know,

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.110
but can I call my lifeline?

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.490
And they said yes.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.610
So he called this
prestigious biologist

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.790
at one of the
California universities.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.770
And they said red.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.514
And the guy answers red, and
he loses the million dollars.

00:43:06.514 --> 00:43:09.860
Oh, I was beside myself.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.660
So if you remember anything,
remember what color

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.320
litmus paper is in acid.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:24.440
But in the river, the pH
can go from 6.5 to 8.5.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:30.800
And the pH effects everything,
from the solubility of metals--

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.385
if it gets too acidic
out there in the river,

00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:40.740
the metals become more soluble,
mercury, cadmium, arsenic,

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.000
all those metals.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.300
So the fish uptake the
metals, and we eat the fish.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.690
And with global warming,
the acidity of the rivers

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:54.210
is gradually drifting
very slightly lower.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.390
It also affects the
forms of phosphorous.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:02.310
So remember, you've
got PO4 to the 3 minus.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.950
But if it's slightly
acidic, you might

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:12.810
have the hydrogen phosphate
or the dihydrogen phosphate.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:20.750
Or you could end up
with phosphoric acid,

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.150
depending on how acidic it gets.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.891
What about
photosynthesis and pH?

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:34.570
Where are my biologists
at, my resident bi--

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.790
there must be somebody
in bio in here.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.160
Come on.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.230
Don't be afraid.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.400
Yes.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.750
There you are.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.446
What's the equation
for photosynthesis?

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.080
AUDIENCE: Water
and carbon dioxide.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.080
JOHN DOLHUN: Good, good.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.150
Water and carbon dioxide.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.100
Let's just write that
down for a moment.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:08.020
So CO2 plus water,
little bit of sun.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.120
AUDIENCE: Oxygen and glucose.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.760
JOHN DOLHUN: Oxygen
and sugars, good.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.610
So CH2O, n.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:25.000
So does the pH go up or
down during photosynthesis?

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.165
I mean, it's like
a 50/50 chance.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.550
Sean, you want to
answer, don't you?

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.520
AUDIENCE: I would
say the pH goes up.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.520
JOHN DOLHUN: It goes up?

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.400
OK.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.180
Anyone else?

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:45.975
Alec?

00:45:45.975 --> 00:45:47.100
AUDIENCE: It goes down?

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.850
JOHN DOLHUN: It goes down?

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.240
OK.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:48.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.500
There you go.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.350
I told you it's
like a 50/50, right?

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:56.130
All right, let's do a
little experiment with this.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.670
I'm going to pour
myself a drink here.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.640
This is good stuff.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.830
It's not Gatorade,
I can tell you that.

00:46:16.175 --> 00:46:21.020
This is a classic test in
the medical profession,

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.020
if you're going to medical
school, for breath.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.160
And when I'm doing this,
you cannot make me laugh.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.670
If you make me
laugh, I'm dead, OK.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:31.730
Please.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:36.540
I'm going to play some
music to relax myself here.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.820
Let me just-- let me see
if we can get this on here.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.540
OK.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.250
There we go.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.460
So I'm breathing into this.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:55.350
We don't hear any
music coming out.

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.922
Going to--

00:46:56.922 --> 00:47:01.190
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.750
There we go.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.030
You're making me laugh, Sean.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.130
I may have to have you come
up and help me with this.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.073
I may not be OK.

00:47:43.073 --> 00:47:44.365
The color's supposed to change.

00:47:44.365 --> 00:47:48.122
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.680
There we are.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.980
Good?

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.700
I'm OK.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.980
So what just happened?

00:48:12.888 --> 00:48:14.930
AUDIENCE: You blew carbon
dioxide into the water.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.000
JOHN DOLHUN: I blew carbon
dioxide in the water.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:25.764
So we've got CO2 plus
water going to what?

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.190
Yeah.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.190
AUDIENCE: Carbonic acid.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:32.315
JOHN DOLHUN: Carbonic acid.

00:48:32.315 --> 00:48:33.125
Good.

00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:41.150
H2CO3, which breaks down
into H plus plus bicarbonate.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:49.850
Now photosynthesis needs
carbon dioxide, right?

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.620
So we take that out
of the equation,

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:57.630
which means we're also
taking out the H plus.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.696
So does the pH go up or down?

00:48:59.696 --> 00:49:00.610
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:01.800
JOHN DOLHUN: Alec?

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.990
Up, up, up.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.650
OK?

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.610
Good.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:07.980
And pollution and
pH, same thing.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.480
If you've got pollution,
you've got all this vegetation.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.140
So you've got photosynthesis,
so the pH is going to be up.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:25.720
This is Lassen Lake, Volcanic
National Park, pH 2, 2.0.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.070
You do not want to stick
your foot into this lake.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:33.900
And then you've got some
safety of the chemicals, which

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:38.580
the most serious is the
azide reagent, which

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.100
it's a neurological toxin.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.620
And if you ingest it,
it can cause death.

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.910
So please be careful with that.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.850
Sulfuric acid, you
know how bad that is.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.520
You don't want to get it
in your respiratory system.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.930
And the manganese
sulfate seems innocuous,

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:01.110
but it attacks the
central nervous system,

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.730
targets blood and kidneys.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:05.250
So be careful with that.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:10.290
Sodium thiosulfate is
a respiratory irritant,

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:13.330
can cause breathing problems.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:17.100
So if you feel like you're
having breathing issues,

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.270
it could be that.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:21.150
Biiodate can burn your eyes.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:24.510
Very, very dangerous
stuff around your eyes.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:28.030
So all of these things, you
have to be careful with.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.560
OK.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.410
So we'll see you Thursday
for the last lecture

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.260
in this series.

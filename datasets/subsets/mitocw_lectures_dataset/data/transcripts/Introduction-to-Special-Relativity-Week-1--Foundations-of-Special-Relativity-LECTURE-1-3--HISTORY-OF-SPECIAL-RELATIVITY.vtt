00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.120
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome
back to 8.20--

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.920
Special Relativity.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.280
In this short video, we look
at the historic backdrop,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.030
the time in which Einstein
was able to develop the theory

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.660
of special relativity.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.780
What were people thinking?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.690
What was the physics
landscape of the time?

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.570
How was technology developed?

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.110
And how did all those things
come together for Einstein

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.160
to thrive and come forward with
those important discoveries

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.805
in physics?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.020
We have to go back to 1900,
around that time in which

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.610
Einstein was able to break
through, break out, and come up

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.780
with completely new
ideas in physics.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.580
Before we go into the
discussion of the timelines,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.930
I'd like you to be invited to
come to Geneva, to Switzerland,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.990
to Bern, to Zurich-- to
the places in which this

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.670
all happened.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.400
Especially Bern is
a historic town,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.860
wasn't destroyed in
the Second World War.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.140
And if you walk
down the streets,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.480
here is a picture
of me two years ago

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.220
in front of the Einstein house.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.760
The streets are basically
unchanged for the last 150

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.770
years, so you look
up into the window,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.200
and you see Einstein
looking down at you.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.620
So if you go back
200 years, in Italy,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.510
people like Volta
and others started

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.210
to make use of
electromagnetic effects.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.130
The first batteries
were developed.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.930
And a theory, a wave theory
of light was developed.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.910
That then let-- slowly
developed into the theory

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.340
of electromagnetism
and the understanding

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.050
of those phenomena.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.480
And the very same
time, in Europe,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.440
the first railroad
systems were developed.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.630
Electromagnetic
induction was understood.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.320
And then in the
1860s, Maxwell was

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.180
able to put all
of those concepts

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.440
together in his famous Maxwell
equations, which are discussed

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.470
at length in 8.02.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.410
People were then,
because of the railroads

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.170
but also because of
telegraphic cables,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.920
able to communicate and
move over a larger distance

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.910
in a shorter amount of time.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.710
And that led to the need
of synchronizing clocks.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.620
To that point, in each town
had one or a few clock towers.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.230
And you just read off the time,
and it was the time of day.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.600
There was no need
to be able to tell

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.420
what time is it in
London when you have

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.200
your breakfast in Munich or
what time the store opens

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.220
in a different city.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.160
There was no need for this
kind of synchronization.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.900
But with the expansion
of railroads,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.180
specifically, there was
a need to understand

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.030
when a train when a train
is on a track and such

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.380
that it doesn't intersect
with another train, avoiding

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.880
collisions.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.550
You also want to know when you
have to be at a train station

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.740
in order to catch the train.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.480
Those things became
important, and they

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.350
led to patents filed around
this time and also later on.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.660
On the theory of light,
people developed all kinds

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.660
of ideas and conflicting
ideas of, for example,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960
mechanical models
of light, which

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.290
relied on the existence of a
medium in which light travels.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.710
And we'll discuss
this at length.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.890
In the 1880s, there's
a new phenomena

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.420
in the structure of physics.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.880
Up to this point,
there was a professor

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.350
of physics at an institute.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.290
He had a chair, and everybody
was working for them.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.240
But then there was
a change in the way

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.600
physics research was conducted,
such that there started

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.410
to be a division of labor
between experimental physicists

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.400
and theoretical physicists.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.950
Around this time, Thomas
Edison developed light bulbs,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.130
meaning that light
and electricity,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.820
those two things became
more woven together.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.100
Electromagnetic waves
were discovered.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.160
And Michelson and Morley
conducted the experiment.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.000
And they did not find a medium
which carried light waves.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.310
And we'll discuss the
Michelson-Morley experiment

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.360
in much more depth.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.020
But this was basically
the backdrop.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.700
Michelson and Morley-- the
idea of electromagnetic waves,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.810
how do they actually travel.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.820
What is the speed in
which they travel?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.920
What are the medium?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.765
And how does this all interact?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.620
So Einstein was born into this.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.190
He was born in Ulm, a German
town, a small German town,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.920
on March 14, 1879, on Pi Day.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.185
He spent his youth in
Munich, where his father--

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.810
he had an electrical
company, a company

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.140
which provided electrical
services-- for example,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.200
for the Oktoberfest in Munich.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.000
And his business
went up and down

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.655
and had to be relocated
later into Italy.

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:36.160
It was a difficult
and interesting time.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.040
So Einstein went to
school in Munich,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.250
in a gymnasium in Munich.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.320
And at some point,
it was time for him

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.790
to go to military service.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.610
And he avoided this
by becoming stateless.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.160
He then wanted to enroll in
a university in Switzerland,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.380
Polytechnic of the
Eidgenossische Technische

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.690
Hochschule in Zurich.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.530
But he wasn't quite admitted,
mainly because his French

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.650
wasn't quite sufficient.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.480
So he had to go an extra round
of studying in order to be then

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.540
admitted to the Polytechnic.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.620
One of his mentors at the
time was Herr Professor Weber.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.480
He was a leading
physicist there.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.340
And they had an
interesting relationship,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.940
which I come back to
in a little while.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:31.630
While studying in
Zurich, Einstein

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.810
met his wife, Mileva Maric.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.140
She was also a physics student,
one of the few female physics

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.280
students there.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.430
And they fell in love,
and they married.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.480
And they had a child together,
or children together.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.980
In 1900, Einstein graduated.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.230
He wasn't the best
student in class.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.330
Neither was Mileva Maric.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.607
And he had a hard
time finding a career.

00:06:58.607 --> 00:07:00.190
So he wanted to stay
at the university

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.780
and enter an academic career,
and that required the mentors

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.520
to be in favor of this.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.440
And since Einstein didn't quite
develop a good relationship

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.090
with Herr Weber and the
other professors around,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.710
they didn't want him there.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.870
They didn't promote his career.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.770
So he didn't know
quite what to do--

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.540
went back to his
parents, to Italy,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:32.230
and didn't get any
traction from where he was.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.150
And he was quite anxious
about this, which

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.490
is visible in letters he wrote.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.370
But he had good friends there.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.820
He had a good friend, Marcel
Grossmann, specifically,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.230
who helped him get into,
after some back and forth,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.520
a position as a lower
level patent clerk

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.860
in a patent office in Bern.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.030
And so this was the
starting point for a career.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.000
So he had this-- he
was a patent clerk.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.700
He had a lot of time on
his hands beyond that.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:06.820
And that started something
which was called the Olympia

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.770
Academy, which consisted
of a group of people who

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.990
studied with and
friends of Einstein,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.500
including Marcel Grossmann.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.120
And they talked and spent
time, took long walks,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.350
spend time drinking,
partying, if you want,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.590
but specifically
talking about physics.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:35.100
And in this framework, Einstein
was able to develop this ideas.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.870
And then 1905 came--

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.909
not in a sudden, but in 1905, he
was able, out of this context,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.870
to develop five very,
very important papers.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.530
The first one was
on light quantum.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.630
He was able to
describe the emission

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.900
and absorption of light.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.740
In April, then, which was
part of his PhD thesis,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.600
he was able to characterize
the size of molecules.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.110
And in May, he was able to
show the existence of atoms.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.210
He was basically
demonstrating this

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.760
by following Brownian
random motion of atoms.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.320
And then in June, he wrote a
paper named electrodynamics

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.400
of moving bodies.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.510
And that is the paper in which
he discovers or describes

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.230
special relativity.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.020
On further review, he
discovered that there's

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.360
a consequence of
special relativity

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.930
that energy and mass are
equivalent in his famous

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.850
equation E equals mc squared.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.010
And we'll come to this, as well.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.940
So this is basically the
framework of this lecture.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.140
If you then move forward into
general relativity, which

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.370
was developed by
Einstein in 1915,

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.340
you can then, again,
follow the development

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.240
of signs of quantum mechanics
of general relativity

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.000
and the conundrum of
describing those two

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.900
concepts at the very same
time, in which, then, Einstein

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.220
lived and moved.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.700
His career developed
then from there on,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.180
not instantly but
systematically.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.090
He had a call as a
professor in Berlin later on

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.770
and, after the Nazis
took over in Germany,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.640
decided to flee Germany.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.210
And he moved to
the United States,

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.220
where he took on a
position in Princeton.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.710
The rest is history,
as you want,

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.360
and we'll hear more
about this tomorrow.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:57.730
PROFESSOR: Over the last several
lectures, we've dealt

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.370
with the representation of
linear time-invariant systems

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.080
through convolution.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.850
And just to remind you of our
basic strategy, essentially,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.230
the idea was to exploit the
notion of linearity by

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.250
decomposing the input into a sum
of basic inputs and then

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.580
using linearity to tell us
that the output can be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.200
represented as the corresponding
linear

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.880
combination of the associated
outputs.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.420
So, if we have a linear system,
either continuous-time

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.570
or discrete-time, for example,
with continuous time, if the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.690
input is decomposed as a linear
combination of basic

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.250
inputs, with each of these basic
inputs generating an

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.900
associated output, and if the
system is linear, then the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.850
output of the system is the same
linear combination of the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.530
associated outputs.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.450
And the same statement is
identical both for continuous

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.170
time and discrete time.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.600
So the strategy is to decompose
the input into these

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.440
basic inputs.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.120
And the inputs were chosen
also with some particular

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.960
strategy in mind.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.390
In particular, for both
continuous time or discrete

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.120
time, in this representation,
the basic inputs used in the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.890
decomposition are chosen, first
of all, so that a broad

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.440
class of signals could be
represented in terms of these

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.840
basic inputs, and second of all,
so that the response to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.660
these basic inputs is, in some
sense, easy to compute.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.420
Now, in the representation which
led us to convolution,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.930
the particular choice that we
made in the discrete-time case

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.630
for our basic inputs was a
decomposition of the input in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.960
terms of delayed impulses.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.780
And the associated outputs
that that generated were

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.580
delayed versions of the
impulse response.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.100
Decomposing the input into a
linear combination of these,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.510
the output into the
corresponding linear

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.190
combination of these, then led
to the convolution sum in the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.430
discrete time case.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.080
And in the continuous-time
case, a similar kind of

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.330
decomposition, in terms of
impulses, and associated

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.740
representation of the output,
in terms of the impulse

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.220
response, led to the convolution
integral.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.380
Now, in this lecture, and for
a number of the succeeding

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.450
lectures, we'll want to turn
our attention to a very

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.120
different set of basic
building blocks.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.150
And in particular, the signals
that we'll be using as the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.740
building blocks for our more
general signals, rather than

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.870
impulses, as we've dealt with
before, will be, in general,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.230
complex exponentials.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.810
So, in a general sense, in the
continuous-time case, we'll be

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.339
thinking in terms of a
decomposition of our signals

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.160
as a linear combination of
complex exponentials,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.740
continuous-time, or, in the
discrete-time case, complex

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.020
exponentials, where z_k is
complex here in discrete time

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.500
and s sub k is complex here
in continuous time.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.860
Now, the basic strategy, of
course, requires that we

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.220
choose a set of inputs, basic
building blocks, which have

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.580
two properties.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.320
One is that the system response
be straightforward to

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.150
compute, or in some sense,
easy to compute.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.280
And second is that it be a
fairly general set of building

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.290
blocks so that we can build lots
of signals out of them.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.690
What we'll find with complex
exponentials, either

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.740
continuous-time or
discrete-time, is that they

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.870
very nicely have those
two properties.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.280
In particular, the notion that
the output of a linear

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.320
time-invariant system is easy
to compute is tied to what's

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.250
referred to as the Eigenfunction
function

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.280
property of complex
exponentials, which we'll

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.780
focus on shortly in a
little more detail.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.600
And second of all, the fact
that we can, in fact,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.880
represent very broad classes
of signals as linear

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.010
combinations of these will be
a topic and an issue that

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.780
we'll develop in detail over,
in fact, the next set of

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.860
lectures, this lecture, and
the next set of lectures.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.960
Now, in doing this, although we
could, in fact, begin with

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.040
our attention focused on, in
general, complex exponentials,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.330
what we'll choose to do is first
focus on the case in

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.150
which the exponent in the
continuous-time case is purely

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:25.420
imaginary, as I indicate here,
and in the discrete-time case,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.990
where the magnitude of
the complex number

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.590
z_k is equal to 1.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.320
So what that corresponds to in
the continuous-time case is a

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.280
set of building blocks of the
form e^(j omega_k t), and in

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.800
the discrete-time case, a set of
building blocks of the form

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.050
e^(j Omega_k n).

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.730
What we'll see is a
representation in these terms

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.570
leads to what's referred
to as Fourier analysis.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.150
And that's what will be dealing
with over the next set

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.870
of lectures.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.290
We'll then be exploiting this
representation actually

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.710
through most of the course.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.700
And then toward the end of the
course, we'll return to

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.110
generalizing the Fourier
representation to a discussion

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.210
Laplace transforms
and Z-transforms.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.900
So for now, we want to restrict
ourselves to complex

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.100
exponentials of a particular
form, and in fact, also

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.980
initially to continuous-time
signals and systems.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.410
So let's begin with the
continuous-time case and the

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.020
complex exponentials that we
want to deal with and focus,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.050
first of all, on what I refer
to as the Eigenfunction

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.000
property of this particular
set of building blocks.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.313
We're talking about basic
signals of the form e^(j

00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:52.563
omega_k t).

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.370
And the statement is that for
a linear time-invariant

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.770
system, the response to one of
these is of exactly the same

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:09.340
form, just simply multiplied
by a complex factor, that

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.680
complex factor depending
on what the

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.020
frequency, omega_k, is.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.820
Now more or less, the
justification for this, or the

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.170
proof, follows by simply looking
at the response to a

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.140
complex exponential, using
the convolution integral.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.750
So if we put a complex
exponentials into a linear

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:39.409
time-invariant system with
impulse response h(t), then we

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.780
can express the response
as I've indicated here.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.320
We can then recognize that this
complex exponentials can

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.680
be factored into two terms.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.180
And so we can rewrite
this complex

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.080
exponential as this product.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.280
Second, recognize that this term
can be taken outside the

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.120
integral, over here, because
of the fact that it depends

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.360
only on t and not on Tau.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.640
And so what we're left with,
when we track this through, is

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.070
that, with a complex exponential
input, we get an

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.120
output which is the same complex
exponential, namely

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.950
this factor, times
this integral.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.620
And this integral is what I
refer to above as H(omega_k).

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.200
And so, in fact, we put in a
complex exponential, we get

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.680
out a complex exponentials of
the same frequency, multiplied

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.650
by a complex constant.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:54.030
And that is what's referred to
as the Eigenfunction property,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.840
Eigenfunction meaning that an
Eigenfunction of a system, or

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.370
mathematical expression, is a
function which, when you put

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.980
it through the system, comes out
looking exactly the same

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.950
except for a change in
amplitude, the change in

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.040
amplitude being the
Eigenvalue.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.440
So in fact, this function
is the Eigenfunction.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.800
And this value is
the Eigenvalue.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.920
OK, now it's because of the
Eigenfunction property that

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.800
complex exponentials are
particularly convenient as

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.950
building blocks.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.900
Namely you put it through the
system, they come out with the

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.980
same form and simply scale.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.780
The other part to the question,
related to the

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:51.480
strategy that we've been
pursuing, is to hope that

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.370
these signals can be used as
building blocks to represent a

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.030
very broad class of signals
through a linear combination.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.230
And in fact, that turns out to
be the case with complex

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.820
exponentials.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.420
As we work our way through that,
we'll first consider the

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.950
case of periodic signals.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.710
And what that leads to is a
representation of periodic

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.360
signals through what's called
the Fourier series.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.690
Following that, we'll turn our
attention to non-periodic, or

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.770
as I refer to it, aperiodic
signals.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.830
And the representation that's
developed in terms of linear

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.270
combinations of complex
exponentials is what's

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.240
referred to as the Fourier
transform.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.550
So the first thing we want to
deal with are periodic signals

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.090
and the Fourier series.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.190
So what we're talking about then
is the continuous-time

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.110
Fourier series.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.180
And the Fourier series is a
representation for periodic

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.090
continuous-time signals.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.730
We have a signal, then,
which is periodic.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.310
And we're choosing T_0
to denote the period.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:19.380
So it's T_0 that corresponds
to the period of

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.660
our periodic signal.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:29.550
omega_0 is 2 pi / T_0, as you
recall from our discussion pf

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.410
periodic signals and
sinusoids before.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.500
And that's 2 pi f_0.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.930
So this is the fundamental
frequency.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:45.240
Now let's examine, first of all,
complex exponentials, and

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.860
recognize, first of all, that
there is a complex exponential

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.060
that has exactly the same
period and fundamental

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.680
frequency as our more general
periodic signal, namely the

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:05.550
complex exponential e^(j omega_0
t), where omega_0 is 2

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:12.640
pi / T_0, or equivalently,
T_0 is 2 pi / omega_0.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.820
Now that's the complex
exponential which has T_0 as

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.760
the fundamental period.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.950
But there are harmonically
related complex exponentials

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.130
that also have T_0 as a period,
although in fact,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.520
their fundamental period
is shorter.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.017
So we can also look at complex
exponentials of the form e^(j

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:38.267
k omega_0 t).

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:46.590
These likewise are periodic
with a period of T_0.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:52.060
Although, in fact, their
fundamental period is T_0 / k,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.480
or equivalently, 2 pi divided
by their fundamental

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.520
frequency, k omega_0.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.070
So as k, an integer, varies,
these correspond to

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:09.140
harmonically related complex
exponentials.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.060
Now what the Fourier series
says, and we'll justify this

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.170
bit by bit as the discussion
goes on, what the Fourier

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:23.030
series says, and in fact, what
Fourier said, which was

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.150
essentially his brilliant
insight, is that, if I have a

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.670
very general periodic signal, I
can represent it as a linear

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.940
combination of these
harmonically-related complex

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.900
exponentials.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.950
So that representation is what
I've indicated here.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:49.580
And this summation is what will
be referred to as the

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.890
Fourier series.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.320
And as we proceed with the
discussion, there are two

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.010
issues that will develop.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.670
One is, assuming that our
periodic signal can be

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.040
represented this way, how do
we determine the Fourier

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.820
series coefficients, as they're
referred to, a_k.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.720
That's one question.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.580
And the second question will
be how broad a class of

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.070
signals, in fact, can be
represented this way.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.340
And that's another question
that we'll deal with

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.590
separately.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.430
Now just focusing on this
representation for a minute,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:43.230
this representation of the
Fourier series, which I've

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:52.000
repeated again here, is what's
referred to as the complex

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.910
exponential form of the
Fourier series.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.740
And it's important to note,
incidentally, that the

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.740
summation involves frequencies,
k omega_0, that

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.800
are both positive
and negative.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.420
In other words, this index k
runs over limits that include

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.700
both negative values and
positive values.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.710
Now that complex exponential
form is one representation for

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.190
the Fourier series.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.080
And in fact, it's the one that
we will be principally relying

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.300
on in this course.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.090
There is another representation
that perhaps

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.030
you've come across previously
and that in a variety of other

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.520
contexts is typically used,
which is called the

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.010
trigonometric form for
the Fourier series.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.240
Without really tracking
through the algebra,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.770
essentially we can get to the
trigonometric form from the

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:56.890
complex exponential form by
recognizing that if we express

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:02.290
the complex coefficient in polar
form or in rectangular

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:09.150
form and expand the complex
exponential term out in terms

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:14.099
of cosine plus j sine, using
just simply Euler's relation,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:21.220
then we will end up with a
representation for the

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.230
periodic signal, or a
re-expression of the Fourier

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:31.140
series expression that we had
previously, either in the form

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.660
that I indicate here, where
now the periodic signal is

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.090
expressed in terms of a
summation of cosines with

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.100
appropriate amplitude
and phase.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.020
Or another equivalent
trigonometric form involves

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.450
rearranging this in terms
of a combination

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.910
of cosines and sines.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.160
Now in this representation,
the frequencies of the

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.790
sinusoids vary only over
positive frequencies.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.860
And typically one thinks of
periodic signals as having

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.590
positive frequencies associated
with them.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:23.910
However, let's look back and the
complex exponential form

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.600
for the Fourier series at
the top of the board.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.110
And in that representation,
when we use this

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:35.180
representation, we'll find it
convenient to refer to both

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.700
positive frequencies and
negative frequencies.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.800
So the representation that we
will most typically be using

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.310
is the complex exponential
form.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:49.480
And in that form, what we'll
find as we think of

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.160
decomposing a periodic signal
into its components at

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.880
different frequencies, it will
involve both positive

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.610
frequencies and negative
frequencies.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:09.850
Okay, now we have the Fourier
series representation, as I've

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.320
indicated here.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.050
Again, so far I've sidestepped
the issue as to whether this

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.040
in fact represents all
the signals that

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.340
we'd like to represent.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.730
Let's first address the issue
of how we determine these

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.350
coefficients a_k, assuming
that, in fact, this

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.450
representation is valid.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.930
And again, I'll kind
of move through the

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.490
algebra fairly quickly.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.460
The algebraic steps are ones
that you can pursue more

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.940
leisurely just to kind
of verify them and

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.660
step through them.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.460
But essentially, the algebra
develops out of the

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.580
recognition that if we
integrate a complex

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.140
exponential over one
period, T_0--

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.610
and I mean by this notation that
this is an integral over

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.550
a period, where I don't
particularly care where the

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.340
period starts and where the
period stops, in other words,

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.040
exactly what period I picked--

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.140
that this integral is equal to
T_0 when m is equal to 0.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.490
And it's equal to 0 if
m is not equal to 0.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.250
That follows simply from the
fact that if we substitute in

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.640
for using or Euler's relation,
so that we have the integral

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:36.540
of a cosine plus j times the
sine, if m is not equal to 0,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.470
then both of these integrals
over a period are 0.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.320
The integral of a of a periodic
of a sinusoid, cosine

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.440
or sine, over an integral
number of periods is 0.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.660
Whereas, if m is equal to 0,
this integral will be equal to

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.350
T_0, the integral
of the cosine.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.840
And the integral of the
sine is equal to 0.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.480
Okay, well, the next step in
developing the expression for

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.180
the coefficient a_k is to refer
back to the Fourier

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:18.170
series expression, which was
that x(t) is equal to the sum

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.420
of a_k e^(j k omega_0 t).

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:28.370
If we multiply both sides of
that by e^(-j n omega_0 t),

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:34.135
and integrate that
over a period--

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.340
both sides of the equation
integrated over a period, so

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.160
these two equations
are equal--

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.680
and then in essence, interchange
the summation and

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.390
the integration so that this
part of the expression comes

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:57.030
outside the sum, and then we
combine these two complex

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:02.540
exponentials together, where we
come out is the expression

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.840
that I've indicated here.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.930
And then essentially what
happens at this point,

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.060
algebraically, is that we use
the result that we just

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.140
developed to evaluate
this integral.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.800
So multiplying both sides of
the Fourier series and then

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.850
doing the integration leads
us, after the appropriate

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.670
manipulation, to the expression

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.140
that I have up here.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:42.550
And this integral is equal to
T_0 if k is equal to n,

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.920
corresponding to 0 up here.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.020
And it's 0 otherwise, which is
what we had demonstrated or

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.840
argued previously.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.970
And the upshot of all that,
then, is that the right hand

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:58.620
side of this expression
disappears except for the term

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.020
when k is equal to n.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:07.400
And so finally, we have what I
indicate here, taking T_0 and

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.050
moving it over to the other
side of the equation, that

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.580
then tells us how we determine
the Fourier series

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.540
coefficients a_n, or a_k.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.810
So that, in effect, then is
what we refer to as the

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:30.040
analysis equation, the equation
that begins with x(t)

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.260
and tells us how to get the
Fourier series coefficients.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.620
What I'll refer to as the
Fourier series synthesis

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:45.330
equation is the equation that
tells us how to build x(t) out

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.340
of these complex exponentials.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.680
So we have the synthesis
equation, which is the one we

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.070
started from.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:58.250
We have the analysis equation,
which is the equation that we

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.500
just developed.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:07.950
So we in effect have gone
through the issue of, assuming

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.580
that a Fourier series
representation is in fact

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.980
valid, how we get the
coefficients.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.440
We'll want to address somewhat
the question of how broad a

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.680
class of signals are
we talking about.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.090
And what's in fact amazing,
and was Fourier's amazing

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.250
insight, was that it's a very
broad class of signals.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:34.690
But let's first look at just
some examples in which we take

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.170
a signal, assume that it
has the Fourier series

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.750
representation, and see what
the Fourier series

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.080
coefficients look like.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.710
So we'll begin with what I refer
to as an antisymmetric

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.110
periodic square wave--

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.010
periodic of course, because
we're talking about periodic

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.950
signals; square wave referring
to its shape; and

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.660
antisymmetric referring
to the fact that it

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.740
is an odd time function.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.440
In other words, it is

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.030
antisymmetric about the origin.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.650
Now the expression for the
Fourier series coefficients

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:23.450
tells us that we determine a_k
by taking 1 / T0 times the

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.140
integral over a period of x(t),
e^(-j k omega_0 t) dt.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.560
The most convenient thing in
this case is to choose a

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:41.550
period, which let's say goes
from -T_0 / 2 to +T_0 / 2.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.370
So here x(t) is -1.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.110
Here x(t) is +1.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:52.060
And so I've expressed the
Fourier series coefficients as

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.950
this integral, that's
from -T_0 / 2 to 0.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:02.010
And then added to that is the
positive part of the cycle.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.550
And so we have these
two integrals.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:10.150
Now, I don't want to track
through the details of the

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.490
algebra again.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.980
I guess I've decided that that's
much more fun for you

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.620
to do on your own.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.270
But the way it comes out when
you go through it is the

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:24.100
expression that I finally
indicate after suggesting that

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.860
there are few more
steps to follow.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.970
And what develops is that those
two integrals together,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:38.040
for k not equal to 0, come
out to this expression.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.830
And that expression is
not valid for k = 0.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:48.160
For k equal to 0, we can go back
to the basic expression

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.340
for the Fourier series, which is
1 / T_0, the integral over

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.770
a period, x(t) e^(-j
k omega_0 t) dt.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:04.170
For k = 0, of course this term
just simply becomes 1.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:10.520
And so the zeroth coefficient is
1 / T_0 times the integral

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.730
of x(t) over a period.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:18.460
Now, going back to the original
function that we

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.460
have, what we're saying then is
that the zeroth coefficient

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.780
is 1 / T_0 times the integral
over one period, which is, in

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.950
effect, the average value.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.060
And it's straightforward to
verify for this case that

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.210
average value is equal to 0.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:45.540
Now let's look at these Fourier
series coefficients on

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.840
a bar graph.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.610
And I've indicated that here.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.090
The expression for the
Fourier series

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:54.980
coefficients we just developed.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.110
And it involves--

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.270
it's 0 for k = 0, it's
a factor of this

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.990
form for k =/= 0.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:10.330
Plotted on a bar graph, then we
see values like this, 0 at

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.920
k = 0 and then associated
values.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.820
And there are a number of things
to focus on when you

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.890
look at this.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:24.210
One is the fact that the Fourier
series coefficients

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:29.870
for this example are
purely imaginary.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.160
A second is that the Fourier
series coefficients for this

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.200
example are an odd sequence.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.160
In other words, if you look at
this sequence, what you see

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.460
are these values for
-k flipped over.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.660
So they're imaginary and odd.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:57.430
And what that results in, when
you look at the trigonometric

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:02.300
form of the Fourier series,
is that in fact, those

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.060
conditions, if you put the terms
all together, lead you

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.590
to a trigonometric
representation, which involves

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.020
only sine terms--

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.280
in other words, no
cosine terms.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.470
Let me just draw your attention
to the fact that,

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:23.760
since a_k's are imaginary, this
j takes care of that fact

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.530
so that these coefficients
are in fact real.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:33.350
So what this says is that for
the antisymmetric square wave,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.845
in effect, the Fourier series
is a sine series.

00:29:36.845 --> 00:29:40.910
The antisymmetric square wave
is an odd function.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.450
Sinusoids are odd functions.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.590
And so this is all kind of
reasonable, that we're

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:50.760
building an odd function
out of odd functions.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:56.320
As an additional aside, which
I won't exploit or refer to

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.740
any further here, but just draw
your attention to, is

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.530
that another aspect of this
periodic square wave, the

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.890
particular one that we chose, is
that it is what's referred

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.720
to as an odd harmonic
function.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:17.480
In other words, for even values
of k, the Fourier

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.660
series coefficients are 0.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.734
They're are only non-zero
for odd values of k.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.970
Now let's look at
another example.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.430
Another example is
the symmetric

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.830
periodic square wave.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:40.240
And this is in fact example 4.5,
worked out in more detail

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.910
in the text.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:46.150
Then I won't bother to work
this out in detail here,

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.630
except to draw your attention
to several points.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.330
Here is the symmetric periodic
square wave.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.470
And what I mean by symmetric
is that it's

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.750
an even time function.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:06.430
Now just kind of extrapolating
your intuition, what you

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.120
should expect is that if it's
only an even time function, it

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.820
should be built up or buildable,
if it's buildable

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.110
at all, out of only
even sinusoids.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.630
And in fact, that's the case.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:25.720
So if we look at the Fourier
series coefficients for this,

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.700
is zeroth coefficient, again, is
the average value, which in

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.350
this case, is 1/2.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:35.550
Here I've plotted pi times the
Fourier series coefficients.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.590
So the zeroth value is pi / 2.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:45.280
The coefficients are now an even
sequence, in other words,

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.000
symmetric about k = 0.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.760
And the consequence of that is
that when you take these

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.080
coefficients and put together
the equivalent trigonometric

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:05.290
form, the trigonometric form
involves only cosines and no

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.040
sine terms.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.530
Now you'll see this in other
examples, not that we'll do in

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.090
the lecture, but examples in
the text and in the video

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.150
manual, if in fact the square
wave was neither symmetric or

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.590
antisymmetric, then the
trigonometric form would

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.480
involve both sines
and cosines.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:30.660
And that is, of course,
the more general case.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:35.250
Furthermore, in the two examples
I've shown here, in

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:40.310
both cases, the signal
is odd harmonic.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.720
In other words, for even values
of k, the coefficients

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.710
are equal to 0.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.260
Although I won't justify that
here, that's a consequence of

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:54.570
the fact that this symmetry is
exactly about half a period.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.570
And if you made the on time of
the square wave different in

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.980
relation to the off
time, then that

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.575
property would also disappear.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:13.240
Now what's kind of amazing,
actually, is that if we take a

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.500
square wave, like I have
here or as I had in the

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.940
antisymmetric case, the
implication is that I can

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.000
build that square wave
by adding up

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.110
enough sines or cosines.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.690
And it really seems kind of
amazing because the square

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.700
wave, after all, is a very
discontinuous function.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.080
Sinusoids are very continuous.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.760
And it seems puzzling that
in fact you can do that.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.690
Well let's look in a little
bit of detail how the

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:55.280
sinusoidal terms add up to
build a square wave.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:01.750
And to do that, let's first
define what I refer to as a

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.480
partial sum.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:10.670
So here we have the expression
which is the synthesis

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.510
equation, telling us how x(t)
could be represented as

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:18.179
complex exponentials
if it can be.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.280
And let's consider just
a finite number of

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.770
terms in this sum.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.630
And so x_n(t), of course, as n
goes to infinity, approaches

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.469
the infinite sum that
we're talking about.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.889
And although we could do this
more generally, let's not.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.760
Let's focus on the symmetric
square wave case, where

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.880
because of the symmetry of these
coefficients, namely

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:46.810
that a_k is equal to a_(-k), we
can rewrite these terms as

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.389
cosine terms.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.880
And so this partial sum can
be expressed the way I'm

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.900
expressing it here.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.990
Well let's look at a
few of these terms.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:05.930
On the graph, I have, first
of all, x(t), which is our

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.330
original square wave.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:14.400
The term that I indicate here
is the factor of 1/2,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.530
which is this term.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.080
With n = 1, that would
correspond to adding one

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.940
cosine term to that.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.420
And so the sum of those two
would be this, which looks a

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.680
little closer to the square
wave, but certainly not very

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.050
close to it at all.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:39.570
And in fact, it's somewhat hard
to imagine without seeing

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.380
the terms build up how in fact,
by adding more and more

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.470
terms, we can generate something
that is essentially

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.230
flat, except at the
discontinuities.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.340
So let's look at this example.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:57.420
And what I'd like to show is
this example, but now as we

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.580
add many more terms to it.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.640
And let's see in fact how these
individual terms add up

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.150
to build up the square wave.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:11.190
So this is the square wave
that we want to build up

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.280
through the Fourier series
as a sum of sinusoids.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.590
And the term for k = 0 will be
a constant which represents

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.550
the DC value of this.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:27.380
And so in the partial sum, as we
develop it, the first thing

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.450
that we'll show is just
the term for k = 0.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:38.020
Now for k = 1, we would add to
that one sinusoidal term.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:43.410
And so the sum of the term
for k = 1 and k = 0

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.800
is represented here.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:52.250
Now when we go to k = 2, because
of the fact that this

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:58.450
is an odd harmonic function,
in fact, the term for k = 2

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:03.230
will have zero amplitude and
so this won't change.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:08.480
Here we show the Fourier
series with k = 2

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.390
and there's no change.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.110
And then we will go to k = 3.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.650
And we will be adding,
then, one

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.570
additional sinusoidal term.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.620
Here is k = 3.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.120
When we go to k = 4, again,
there won't be any change.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:31.420
But there will be another term
that's added at k = 5 here.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.560
Then k = 6, again, because it's
odd harmonic, no change.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.350
And finally k = 7
is shown here.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:45.040
And we can begin to see that
this starts to look somewhat

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.160
like the square wave.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.500
But now to really emphasize how
this builds up, let's more

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.680
rapidly add many more terms,
and in fact increase the

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.790
number of terms up to about
100, recognizing that the

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:05.560
shape will only change on the
inclusion of the odd-numbered

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.370
terms, not the even-numbered
terms, because it's an odd

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.970
harmonic function.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:16.620
So now we're increasing and
we're building up toward k =

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.530
100, 100 terms.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:24.970
And notice that it is the
higher-order terms that tend

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:30.340
to build up the discontinuity
corresponding to the notion

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.940
that the discontinuity, or sharp
edges in a signal, in

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.340
fact, are represented through
the higher frequencies in the

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.550
Fourier series.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.900
And here we have a
not-too-unreasonable

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.150
approximation to the original
square wave.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.890
There is the artifact of the
ripples at the discontinuity.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.710
And in fact, that rippling
behavior at the discontinuity

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.180
is referred to the
Gibbs phenomenon.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.650
And it's an inherent part
of the Fourier series

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.380
representation at
discontinuities.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.700
Now to emphasize this, let's
decrease the number

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.450
of terms back down.

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:21.600
And we will carry this down to
k = 1, again to emphasize how

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.370
the sinusoids are building
up the square wave.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:29.100
Here we are back at k = 1.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.490
And then finally, we will add
back in the sinusoids

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.640
that we took out.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.550
And let's build this back up
to 100 terms, showing the

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.380
approximation that we generated
with 100 terms to

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.630
the square wave.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.650
Okay, so what you saw is that,
in fact, we got awfully close

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.990
to a square wave.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.810
And the other thing that was
kind of interesting about it

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:14.610
as it went along was the
fact that, with the low

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.650
frequencies, what we were
tending to build was the

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.460
general behavior.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:26.490
And as the higher frequencies
came in, that tended

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.590
contribute to the
discontinuity.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:34.030
And in fact, something that will
stand out more and more

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.150
as we go through our discussion
of Fourier series

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:41.430
and Fourier transforms, is that
general statement, that

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:48.750
it's the low-frequency terms
that represent the broad time

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.860
behavior, and it's the
high-frequency terms that are

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.940
used to build up the sharp

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.660
transitions in the time domain.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.670
Now we need to get a little
more precise about the

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:10.210
question of how, in fact, the
Fourier series, or when the

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.730
Fourier series represents the
functions that we're talking

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.140
about and in what sense
they represent them.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:26.840
And so if we look again at the
synthesis equation, what we

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.750
really want to ask is, if we add
up enough of these terms,

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:37.700
in what sense does this sum
represent this time function?

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.660
Well, let's again use the notion
of our partial sum.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:47.000
So we have the partial
sum down here.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.120
And we can think of the
difference between this

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:59.300
partial sum and the original
time function as the error.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.210
And I've defined
the error here.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:07.540
And what we would like to know
is does this error decrease as

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.150
we add more and more terms?

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:13.660
And in fact, in what sense, if
the error does decrease, in

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.640
what sense does it decrease?

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.420
Now in detail this is
a fairly complicated

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.810
and elaborate topic.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.930
I don't mean to make that
sound frightening.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.130
It's mainly a statement
that I don't want to

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.770
explore in a lot of detail.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:34.030
But it relates to what it's
referred to as the issue of

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.010
convergence of the
Fourier series.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.310
And the convergence of the
Fourier series, the bottom

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:45.220
line on it, the kind of end
statement, can be made in

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.710
several ways.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.090
One statement related to the
convergence of the Fourier

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.590
series is the following.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:58.590
If I have a time function, which
is what is referred to

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.400
as square integrable, namely
its integral, over

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.350
a period, is finite.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:10.060
Then what you can show, kind
of amazingly, is that the

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.440
energy in that error, in other
words, the energy and the

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.160
difference between the original
function and the

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.370
partial sum, the energy
in that, goes to 0

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.770
as n goes to infinity.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:30.120
A somewhat tighter condition is
a condition referred to as

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:37.590
it Dirichlet conditions, which
says that if the time function

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:42.170
is absolutely integrable, not
square integrable, but

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.170
absolutely integrable--

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:47.510
and I've kind of hedged the
issue by just simply referring

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:50.800
to x(t) as being
well behaved--

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.170
then the statement is that the
error in fact goes to 0 as n

00:43:56.170 --> 00:44:00.090
increases, except at the
discontinuities.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:04.690
And what well behaved means in
that statement is that, as

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.580
discussed in the book, there are
a finite number of maxima

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.310
and minima in any period and
a finite number of finite

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.500
discontinuities, which is,
essentially, always the case.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.890
So under square integrability
what we have is the statement

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.240
not that the partial sum goes
to the right value at every

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:28.250
point, but that the energy
in the error goes to 0.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.790
Under the Dirichlet conditions,
it says that, in

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:35.800
fact, the signal goes to the
right value at every time

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.560
instant except at the
discontinuities.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:47.770
So going back to the square
wave, the square wave

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.880
satisfies either one of
those conditions.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:55.180
And so what the consequence is
is that, with the square wave,

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.680
if we looked at the error, then
in fact what we would

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.690
find is that the energy in the
error would go to zero as we

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.810
add more and more terms
in the partial sum.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:11.890
And in fact, since the square
wave also satisfies the

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:16.770
Dirichlet conditions, the actual
value of the error, the

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:22.180
difference between the partial
sum and the true value, will

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.610
actually go to 0.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:28.330
That difference will go to 0
except at the discontinuities.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:34.860
And that, in fact, is kind of
evident as we watch the

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.170
function build up by adding
up these terms.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:44.880
And so in fact, let's go back
and see again the development

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.690
of the partial sums
in relation to the

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.700
original time function.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.000
Let's observe, this time again,
basically what we saw

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.710
before, which is that it builds
up to the right answer.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:00.200
And furthermore what we'll
plot this time, also as a

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.540
function of time, is the
energy in the error.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.300
And what we'll see is that the
energy in the error will be

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:12.270
tending towards 0 as the number
of terms increases.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.310
So once again, we have
the square wave.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:21.010
And we want to again show the
buildup of the Fourier series,

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:25.510
this time showing also how the
energy in the error decreases

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:28.120
as we add more and more terms.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.930
Well, once again, we'll begin
with k = 0, corresponding to

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.510
the constant term.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:38.060
And what's shown on the bottom
trace is the energy in the

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.120
error between those two.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:46.870
And we'll then add the term k
= 1 to the DC term and we'll

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:52.150
see that the energy will
decrease when we do that.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.160
Here we have then the sum
of k = 0 and k = 1.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:01.470
Now with k = 2, the energy won't
decrease any further

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.685
because it's an odd
harmonic function.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:10.210
That's what we've
just added in.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.710
When we add in the term for k
= 3, again, we'll see the

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.430
energy in the error decrease
as reflected

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.680
in the bottom curve.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.620
So there we are at k = 3.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:30.100
When we go to k = 4,
there again is no

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.850
change in the error.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.203
At k = 5, again the
error decreases.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.940
k = 6, there will be
no change again.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.500
And at k = 7, the energy
decreases.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.020
And now let's show how the error
decreases by building up

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.830
the number of terms
much more rapidly.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:56.610
Already the error has gotten
somewhat small on the scale in

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.380
which we're showing it, so let's
expand out the error

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.090
scale, the vertical axis
displaying the energy in the

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:09.220
error, so that we could watch
how the energy decreases as we

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.090
add more and more terms.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:15.070
So here we have the vertical
scale expanded.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:20.030
And now what we'll do is
increase the number of terms

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.490
in the Fourier series and watch
the energy in the error

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:28.750
decreasing, always decreasing,
of course, on the inclusion of

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.380
the odd-numbered terms and not
on the inclusion of the

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.380
even-numbered terms because of
the fact that it's an odd

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.030
harmonic function.

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:41.230
Now the energy in the error
asymptotically will approach

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.580
0, although point by point, the
Fourier series will never

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.820
be equal to the square wave.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:53.370
It will, at every instant
of time, except at the

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:58.640
discontinuities, where there
will always be some ripple

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.370
corresponding to what's referred
to as the Gibbs

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:02.620
phenomenon.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:11.870
So what we've seen, then, is
a quick look at the Fourier

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:17.560
series representation
of periodic signals.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:25.370
We more broadly want to have a
more general representation of

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.080
signals in terms of complex
exponentials.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.250
And so our next step will
be to move toward a

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:37.440
representation of nonperiodic
or aperiodic signals.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.950
Now the details of this, I leave
for the next lecture.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.760
The only thought that I want to
introduce at this point is

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:49.420
the basic strategy which is
somewhat amazing and kind of

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.810
interesting to reflect
on in the interim.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:50:00.060
The basic strategy with an
aperiodic signal is to think

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:05.410
of representing this aperiodic
signal as a linear combination

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:12.590
of complex exponentials by the
simple trick of periodically

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:18.540
replicating this signal,
generating a periodic signal

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.590
using a Fourier series
representation for that

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:27.100
periodic signal, and then simply
letting the period go

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.650
to infinity.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.620
As the period goes to infinity,
that periodic signal

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.520
becomes the original aperiodic
one that we had before.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.470
And the Fourier series
representation then becomes

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.340
what we'll refer to the
Fourier transform.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:49.060
So that's just a quick look at
the basic idea and approach

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.140
that we'll take.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.620
In the next lecture, we'll
develop this a little more

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.500
carefully and more fully,
moving from the Fourier

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.670
series, which we've used for
periodic signals, to develop

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:03.740
the Fourier transform, which
will then be representation

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.310
for aperiodic signals.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:06.560
Thank you.

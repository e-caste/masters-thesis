00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
[CLICKING]

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.630
JOHN DOLHUN: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.620
So I'm going to start off today
with a small demonstration.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.350
And I wonder if
somebody could tell me

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.250
what are the states of matter?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.820
Yeah?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.767
Aisha?

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:41.850
AUDIENCE: Solid, liquid,
gas, and then [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.260
JOHN DOLHUN: Solid,
liquid, gas, and plasma.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.910
Good.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.410
Good.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.270
OK.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.255
So the plasma is one that we
don't oftentimes talk about.

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:55.630
And that's what
we're going to be

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.920
talking about in this lecture.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.500
So what we're going to
do-- a plasma basically

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.990
is a group of ionized
gas molecules.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.660
The sun and the
stars are plasma.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.610
This is a plasma globe,
which on a small scale

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.320
you're not actually going to be
able to see the plasma inside

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.120
because it's not hot enough.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.440
But we'll be able to see the
colors from the emissions.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.850
So ionization is when an
electron hits a gas particle,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.000
kicks an electron off,
and produces a gas ion.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.430
That's ionization.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.620
That's what's happening
on the Sun and the stars.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.300
I mean, you've got this sea
of ions that's molting hot.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.495
And then emission happens when
the gas ion grabs its electron

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:47.995
back.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.650
And what it does is
then it gives off light.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.820
And that's what we're
going to see here.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.910
So I've got two
plasmas actually.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.510
I've got the plasma globe.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.810
And I've also got a
fluorescent light bulb,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.500
which is also a plasma.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.600
And I need a volunteer--

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.960
someone who wants to be a
conductor between the two

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.580
plasmas.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.780
Someone who's not--

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.580
Alex, come on down.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.210
All right.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.950
So Alex, you can stand
right in the front

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.040
actually, kind of over here.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.430
So we're going to
start by just shining

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.070
120 volts through this globe.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.080
That's 120 volts going through.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.740
And what I'm going to be
doing is putting 70,000 volts

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.340
through this.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.230
And then we're going to--

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.810
Alex is going to
be the conductor.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.700
So we're going to put the
70,000 volts through Alex.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.650
They'll crawl along his skin--

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.357
the surface of his skin.

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.190
And he's going to hold
the fluorescent light

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.110
bulb in his other hand.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.360
And I don't know.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.680
Hopefully he'll be
able to light it.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.310
I mean in that fluorescent
light bulb, it's plasma.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.540
There's mercury.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.240
You have to ionize
the mercury first.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.860
It gives off UV radiation,
grabs its electron back,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.950
and then it shines
that invisible UV

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.190
on the phosphorescent
coating of the bulb.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.670
And we see the white
light given off.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.460
So we'll try this out.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.570
Can someone shut the
lights off there?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.490
Just turn those lights off?

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.630
Yeah.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.130
I think so.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.630
Yeah.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.400
Just hold that in.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.025
That's perfect.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.890
So before we start Alex, I
think we're going to have you--

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.770
let's see if we get
this thing going here.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.680
You want to just bring
your hand up toward that?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.720
Yeah.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.830
OK.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.210
All right.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.460
Put this pair of
goggles on just in case.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.050
OK.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.910
Mainly for the fluorescent bulb.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.740
OK.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.930
Now what's going
to happen now is

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.850
I'm going to have you
hold your hand there.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.887
And don't take it off.

00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:19.220
You're not going to get shocked.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.339
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.880
JOHN DOLHUN: And I'm
going to have you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.170
hold this in your other hand.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.560
Now put your hand there.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.720
Good.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.890
Now here we go.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.390
Ready?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.420
Wow.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.630
AUDIENCE: Really cool.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.590
JOHN DOLHUN: All right.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.185
You feel a little
warmth on your hand?

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:35.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.852
JOHN DOLHUN: Not too hot?

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:37.925
AUDIENCE: Not too hot.

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.200
No.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.450
JOHN DOLHUN: 70,000
volts going through him

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.090
along the surface of his
skin coming out the hand

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.360
and ionizing the mercury in
a fluorescent light bulb.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.320
So that's pretty good.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.670
Thank you very much, Alex.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.080
You're very brave.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.040
Yeah give him a hand.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.990
All right.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.240
So you saw two plasmas there.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.900
And the plasma we're going
to talk about today--

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.060
and here we'll bring the
lights back up there.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.950
Oh, there we go.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:10.970
He's got it.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.590
We've got our own
technician here.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.800
So excellent.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.620
So we've reached the final
lecture in this series.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.950
We're going to be talking
about inductively coupled

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.030
plasma mass spectrometry.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.950
And this is a
lecture where you'll

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.430
be able to impress
yourself and your friends

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.790
because there's only two
of these machines at MIT.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.670
And it's a very
rare opportunity.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.610
We're actually introducing
this machine in 5.310.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.340
You're going to be the first
ones that have an opportunity

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.300
to use this machine.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.340
So we're going to answer a
series of questions here.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.060
What is ICP-MS?

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.520
What can be detected with it?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.120
What are the main components?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.430
How it works.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.730
And some of the challenges
we're going to face in using it.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.440
And then we'll talk a little
bit about the MIT Experiment.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.360
And we'll spend
the last 10 minutes

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.070
or so talking about
mercury analysis.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.630
So inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.210
There are two things
that separate this

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.370
from all other
forms of mass spec.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:40.160
And they are high
temperature and high energy.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.040
And it's a combination
of those two things

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.920
that allows the
sample to decompose.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:05.150
It undergoes atomization
and then ionization.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.490
So what you can actually
detect with this

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.050
is pretty much most of the
elements in the periodic table

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.260
at the part per trillion level.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.310
That's mind boggling-- at
the part per trillion level.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:32.550
And what this machine does
is it scans from 5 lithium--

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:41.250
this is the mass scale up
to 260, which is uranium.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.740
Now that's another big
difference between this

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.680
and the other forms
of mass spectrometry.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.020
Because the other forms--

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.910
we have molecular
weights that are

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.640
in the hundreds of thousands
for these nucleic acids,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.880
these carbohydrates,
the proteins

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.500
that we're trying to study.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.280
And from regular mass spec,
which is a much lower energy,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.660
much lower ionization, we're
looking for molecular weight

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.720
information about
these biomolecules

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.700
and some fragmentation
information.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.450
So we're primarily concerned
about carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.280
nitrogen, phosphorus,
and sulfur.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.790
Those are pretty much the six
elements regular mass spec

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.005
would be concerned with.

00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:35.820
With this machine we're rapidly
scanning the whole range

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.850
of all these elements
and the mass range--

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.690
the top mass range is
260 for this machine.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.660
So that's the big difference.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.430
Now, what are the
main components?

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.040
So what we've got is we've
got our sample introduction.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.850
And the sample is
going to be a liquid.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.300
So it's a liquid that
enters the sample intro.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:08.950
And that liquid is
converted to an aerosol.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:14.620
And the aerosol gets shot
into a plasma ion source.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.900
And in that ion
source, that's where

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.390
your ionization takes place.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.400
Sample is going to be dried
out, decomposed, atomized,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.260
and the elements are
going to be ionized.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.330
And then we've got an ion lens,
which focuses that ion beam.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.420
So this focuses the ion beam.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.560
We also have a
collision reaction cell,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.290
where we actually
introduce helium.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.400
And the helium bombards
our ions and gets rid

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.120
of the interferences,
like the polyatomic ions

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.040
we're going to talk about.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.990
So this removes interferences.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.150
And then the monatomic
ions that are

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.430
left to enter this
quadrupole mass

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.370
analyzer, which is four rods--

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.490
the ions travel down
the center of those rods

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.550
and they're sorted by their
mass to charge ratios.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.810
The ions are then
counted at the detector.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.720
And we've got-- the
detector actually

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.370
records the counts per second
of every ion hitting it.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.070
And these counts can be
like hundreds of thousands

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.245
of counts for each
ion every second.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.720
So counts per second recorded.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.800
And interestingly, the detector
takes those counts per second

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.670
and then it goes and looks
at our calibration standards.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.160
And it associates
those counts per second

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.880
with our concentrations in
our calibration standards.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.140
And then you've got
concentration for your samples.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.180
So the counts per
second then head

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.720
into our data system and the
software analyzes all this

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.420
and produces us some data.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.535
Let's take a look
and see how it works.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.780
So here's our sample--

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.970
a liquid sample.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.730
And we've got a little
peristaltic pump

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.410
that pumps the liquid up to
this thing called the nebulizer.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.710
The nebulizer is going to
convert it into an aerosol.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.090
But coming in here, notice
there's a dilution gas.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.720
The dilution gas is argon.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.110
And argon actually dilutes
our sample right at that point

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.450
before it enters
this spray chamber.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.170
Once the aerosol gets in
here, there's a make up gas--

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.680
also argon-- that
pushes the droplets down

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.080
to the bottom of the tube.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.930
Once they're down
here, they have

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:19.140
to make two right turns to
end up outside the ion source.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.450
And those two right
hand turns cause

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.980
the larger droplets to be pumped
out and fall by the wayside.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.820
So the most sample
that is actually

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.240
going to enter this ion
source is only about 2%

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.490
of our original sample.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.830
We've gotten rid of the rest.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.380
Now once it goes
into this ion source,

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.330
there are three
concentric glass tubes.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.560
So the ions will go into
the center tube here.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.590
And look at these
gases coming in here.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.170
Plasma gas and
auxiliary gas-- they're

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.080
coming in at right angles.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.180
And both of those
gases are argon.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.210
So the gas comes
in at right angles

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.110
and it forms like a mini
tornado inside of this tube.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.810
It's like a hurricane
going on in there.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:16.440
And that cyclonic motion picks
up the sample into a vortex.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.480
And what goes into a
vortex stays in a vortex.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.710
Right?

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.600
So you've got your
sample trapped up

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.850
in this vortex moving
through this tube.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.950
And then there's an electrode
sending electrons out.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.030
And look at this.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.650
We've got this Rf coil
wrapped around the glass tube.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.000
That's producing about
1,500 watts of power.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.420
It's like 27.1 megahertz.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.280
And look at my hand.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.800
The old right hand
rule goes into play.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.420
Remember this.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.610
What are my fingers doing?

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.480
What are we making in that tub?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.080
Roberto?

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.570
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah, an
electromagnetic field.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:07.340
And that electromagnetic field
is thrashing around in there.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.170
And it's so powerful that it
can rip an electron off argon.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:18.320
So we've got our argon
hitting that energy.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.240
There's your high energy.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.900
And you've got argon
ions plus electrons.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.560
And those argon
ions and electrons

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.620
are just smashing around,
twirling around in there.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.500
And the collisions from that,
the kinetic energy that's

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.450
given off--

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.760
that's your plasma.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.300
So that's all happening
inside of that tube.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.380
Let's take a bigger view of it.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.350
This is a blown up view
of what's happening here.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:53.770
So here is your aerosol sample
going down the center tube.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.010
What happens to the
sample is it's actually--

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:02.190
the liquid is dried out
to a solid in that tube.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.250
And then that
solid is vaporized.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.620
It's atomized, decomposed,
and then ionized.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.290
The temperatures in here--

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.550
they can get up to 8,000 kelvin.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.780
I mean, you're talking like the
temperature of the sun is what?

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.360
6,000-- a little
under 6,000 Kelvin?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.180
So the temperatures
are very hot.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.820
And you can see this plasma
when the machine is on.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.480
You'll see the glow of this
white hot plasma that's

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.130
actually formed in there.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.740
So what you've got is
your ions coming out.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.560
Your plus charged ions
will come out here.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:47.380
And what's going to happen is
they will then enter the ion

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.790
lens, which I'll show you.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:56.810
So what I've done here is I've
actually opened up our machine.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.400
And this is the ion source.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.110
That's where the
plasma is generated.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.610
It's a glass tube.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.610
And you can see
the Rf coil there.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:16.180
And right behind it, you can't
see, is this sample cone.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.690
So what I did is push a button
here and moved this back

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.740
to reveal the sample cone.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.410
Now think about this.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:31.020
Inside of this box you've got
like 6,000 Kelvin going on

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.100
in there.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.730
Outside is room temperature.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.940
It's like putting the
Earth a couple of miles

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.620
away from the sun.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.990
That's what you're doing here.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.200
And what this cone is,
it's made of copper.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.330
And it's got a nickel center
with the little hole in it.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.890
And what happens is there's
a grounding system here.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.880
So the electrons coming
out of this torch box,

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.420
coming out at the speed
of light, go to ground.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.850
The positive
charges-- the ions--

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.349
cannot go to ground.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.140
So they build up on this cone.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.859
And here you've got a cone
with all these positive ions

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.319
building up with
a tiny hole in it.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.150
It's a no brainer.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.950
They get pushed through.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:24.410
And so on the other
side of this box

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:29.550
is the high vacuum low pressure
area of the mass spectrometer.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.180
So we've got here-- we've
got this high temperature,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.030
high pressure.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.570
We've got room temperature and
then we've got low pressure.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.520
Three areas of this
mass spectrometer.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.910
So the ions going
through this, that's

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.470
the best definition of
an ion lens you can have.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.530
And I unscrewed this so
you could see inside.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.110
There's a skimmer cone--
another cone-- before you

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.840
get into the high vacuum area.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.810
So now let's talk a moment
about the challenges

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.420
with this system.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.720
There are some challenges.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.800
Nothing is easy.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.860
Right?

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.070
In this world everything
can be challenging.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.270
So it turns out
that there are a lot

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.900
of isotopes of
different elements

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.470
that have the same mass.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.820
They overlap.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.610
These are isobaric overlap--

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:37.810
calcium 40 and argon 40, iron
58, nickel 58, indium 115,

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.860
and tin 115.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.560
Isobaric overlaps are
pretty easy to take

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.920
care of because we can
choose an interference

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.120
free isotope of the element.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.900
That means that every
one of these elements

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.740
has at least one isotope
that doesn't overlap.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.030
So with the ICP-MS we can
key in on that isotope

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.610
and measure just that
isotope and we're good.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:15.380
The only problem is indium
115 doesn't have any isotopes.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.870
They all overlap with something.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.000
So what we have to do
is type an equation

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.990
into the mass spectrometer
to take care of that.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.880
And the main
interference is tin 115.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.780
So the equation
is pretty simple.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:38.660
We take the counts per second
of indium that we want to find.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.110
And we take the
counts per second

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:52.930
of everything, which is the
indium 115 plus the tin 115.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.970
That's the total
counts we're seeing.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:02.860
And then we subtract the counts
per second of the interferent.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.400
And the way we get that
is we multiply this

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.110
by an isotope ratio.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:26.470
We multiply it by the abundance
of the interferent divided

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:35.030
by the abundance of an isotope
of tin that does not interfere,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.550
which would be tin 118.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.460
So we can take those two
abundances, get a ratio there.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.150
Multiply that times the
total counts and end up

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.460
getting our counts
for indium 115.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.880
And all this is done
by the software.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.190
There's one other
equation I have to put

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.810
in this mass spectrometer.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:21:01.500
It's for lead because
lead 206, 207, and 208--

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.910
any time you dig up lead
anywhere on the Earth

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.590
basically, the isotope ratios
will always be different

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.770
because of all the radioactive
decay that's going on

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.760
from when the Earth was formed.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.030
And so we put this in.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.350
And we add all the isotopes
of lead up to the 208

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.390
and we get a total
and that that's good.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.960
That's how we do it.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.460
Then we have these
polyatomic ions.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.800
In the plasma you've
got argon and oxygen.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.380
So they can combine
with each other

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:43.470
to form these polyatomics, which
interfere with other elements.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.300
They overlap directly.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.910
Argon, argon, which would
be argon 40 and argon 38

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.520
overlaps with selenium.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.600
And then if we add our
matrix like our acids--

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.110
hydrochloric acid you're
putting chlorine in.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.690
Sulfuric you're putting sulfur.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.610
Nitric you're putting nitrogen.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.550
So you can have a
whole slew of these.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:13.080
The two most challenging
ones are selenium 78

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:18.210
and arsenic 75 because those
two elements give the weakest

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.800
signal of all the
elements for ICP-MS.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.660
The only ionize about 30%.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.550
So we've got to get rid
of these polyatomics.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.320
Another thing that
can happen is you can

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.740
have doubly charged ions form.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.820
Cerium is an element
in our tuning solution.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.790
Cerium has a molecular
weight of 140.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.340
If it's doubly charged,
you divide that by 2

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.080
and you get 70.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.630
So a doubly charged cerium
would interfere with gallium.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.120
So somehow, we've got to
take these into account.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.910
And there's a whole
table of them.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.200
Look at this.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.360
I'm giving you this so
you don't have to search

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.130
for these in the dark.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.970
This is everything right here.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.720
Everything that I wrote
up there is included here.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.570
And typically, most
of these interferences

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.660
come below mass 82.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.430
So how are we going
to deal with these?

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.790
We've got to figure out
a way to deal with them.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:27.110
And in comes the
collision reaction cell.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.350
So just to put this
back in perspective--

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.470
here's our nebulizer
and our tube--

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.940
our torch.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.880
And then this is the
high vacuum low pressure

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.370
area of the mass spectrometer.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.390
So we've got a collision
reaction cell here

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.950
that we put helium in.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.130
And we fill it with helium and
the helium starts colliding

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.420
with the ions--

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.380
both the polyatomics
and the monatomics.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.100
And those collisions give
off the same kinetic energy,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.760
whether it's a plus
1 ion or polyatomic.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.700
However, think about this.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.960
Polyatomics are
bigger so they start

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.840
colliding more frequently
with the helium

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.080
so they give off
more kinetic energy.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.970
So there's a positive
discrimination voltage--

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.220
a kinetic energy
of discrimination

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.460
that prevents the
polyatomics from going out

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.750
of that octupole, that
collision reaction cell.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.660
This is amazing.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.350
I mean, 15 years
ago or something

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.520
they didn't have this.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.710
They had to put equations
in for everything.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.510
Now at least there's a way to
get rid of the polyatomics.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.020
So what goes through are
the monatomic ions down

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.185
this quadrupole mass
filter toward the detector.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.550
This is the detector.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.520
It's a pretty fancy detector.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.520
It's got these dynodes, which
are electrodes in vacuum that

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.440
produce electrons.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.630
They multiply electrons.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:12.290
This thing has 26 dynodes
connected together.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.630
So when the ion hits, it
produces a couple electrons.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.030
Those electrons hit
the next dynode.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.030
They get multiplied
exponentially

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.590
and then it continues.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.280
And then finally, you get
down here to the last dynode

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.210
and that's called
your pulse signal.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:36.810
And that's where you could have
a million counts or something.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:40.160
And once that signal
becomes saturated

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.230
then the machine says to
itself well, wait a minute.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.480
I have to pull back.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.920
So it goes back a few dynodes,
picks up the analog signal,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.840
and then the software multiplies
that by some pulse analog ratio

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.800
to make it look like a pulse.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.570
It's quite complex.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:06.250
But you can actually-- when
it's graphing your elements,

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.950
if a point goes
on the graph, you

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.830
can tell whether it's
a pulse or analog point

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.000
and if it's been corrected.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.860
So this is pretty
much the detector.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.450
Let's see what
else we have here.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.580
So what are we going
to detect in this lab?

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.800
So we're actually going to be
looking at these 29 elements.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.530
We picked 29 elements
that we're going

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:42.400
to be scanning and monitoring
during our river lab.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.170
What we did is we
actually got standards

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.340
that contained these 29 elements
so we could make up calibration

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.200
standards for you for this lab.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.450
We also have a set of
internal standards, which

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:03.680
are four elements that are
not part of the 29 elements

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.960
that we're looking at.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.980
And the internal standards
are there to actually--

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.540
they're pumping
through the machine

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.410
constantly with every sample,
with every calibration

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:21.230
standard, with your blanks,
and they're telling us

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.970
about the drift of the machine.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.600
We can look at this and see,
oh, things look pretty good.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.790
They're hugging
together very nicely.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.640
This run here is
about a five hour run.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.270
And so if those internal
standards are staying together,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.290
we know the machine
is doing well.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.750
But if something happens
to the internal standards,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.100
then we see we might
have a problem.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.320
So we can actually go in and try
to figure out what's going on.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.750
Along with this, we also have
quality control standards.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.380
Here's your 29 elements again.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.020
But we bought these
from a different company

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.780
than our calibration standards.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.660
And each one of the
elements in this mix

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.070
has a defined concentration.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.970
So this mix comes from the
National Institute of Standards

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.980
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.300
And we'll be running one
of these with your samples.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.010
So you'll be able
to look at this

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.170
and say, oh, these
look pretty good.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.040
We're very close to
the ranges we want.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.650
That means things
are working well.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.050
Your results are really
going to mean something

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.800
when we have all these controls
and all our calibration

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.570
standards and quality
control standards.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.440
So a little bit of
EPA terminology--

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.140
when you get your report,
which will be a PDF file,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.250
you'll see various things
like calibration blank.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.330
What this is just
reagent water that's

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.830
acidified the same way as
our calibration standards.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:08.390
And we run that blank before we
run the calibration standards.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.590
And then we'll run a series of
maybe 10 calibration standards,

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.800
do another blank, then we'll run
our quality control standard.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.670
And we'll also be running
something called a laboratory

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:27.140
reagent blank where
one of the TAs

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:32.690
will actually take water
to the river Milli-Q water.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.830
And open it up and just let
it breathe the air there.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.780
And then bring it
back to the lab.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.540
And then they're going
to filter that water

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.010
the same way you're filtering
your real river samples.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.400
And then they're going
to acidify it exactly

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.760
like you're acidifying
your river samples.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.730
And so we're going to have a
blank called the laboratory

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.910
reagent blank that will
tell us, hey, there

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.270
may have been something
in the funnel we're using

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:08.660
or something in one of those
new filtering membrane disks

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.910
that got into this
sample and it's also

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.750
going to be in your sample.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.200
So that's another
quality control.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.830
And then we've got-- we're
going to run 10 samples.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:25.550
And then we run a CCB, which is
a continuing calibration blank.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.850
It's another blank just to
make sure everything's OK.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:33.680
And then we run a CCV, which
is a continuing calibration

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.670
verification, which ends
up being one of our--

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.620
we pick one of our
calibration standards.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.920
Usually the midpoint standard.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.450
And we stick it in there just to
make sure things are still OK.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:51.200
Then we'll run another
10 samples, another CCB,

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.030
and a CCV.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.850
So that's what those terms mean.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:31:00.490
When you see these
you're not overwhelmed.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.180
You'll kind of understand
what these terms are.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.630
This is from the EPA method
that we're actually using.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.080
The protocol is very detailed.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.510
And the TAs are going to go
over this with you in the lab.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.290
They'll pull out
the tubes, they'll

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.830
pull out the filtration system.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.380
They'll show you how to
connect it to the vacuum,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.870
show you what kind of
bottles to take to the river

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.730
and collect this from.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.920
So they'll be going
through all of this.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.090
Now we have to
talk about mercury.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:44.250
There's a lot of mercury
up there in the atmosphere.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.400
Who knows where all this
mercury's coming from?

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.510
Where does all the
elemental mercury

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.680
in the atmosphere come--

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.452
Brian?

00:31:56.452 --> 00:31:57.600
AUDIENCE: Coal.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.990
JOHN DOLHUN: Coal is a big one.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.490
Yeah.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.550
That's a man made source
of some of the mercury.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.150
Yeah.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.840
What else?

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.440
I mean, look at the mercury.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.630
Look at the elemental mercury
floating around up there.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:26.845
Where else could it come from
besides our energy source?

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.170
Yes, Autumn?

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.287
AUDIENCE: Maybe if there's
like a forest fire.

00:32:33.287 --> 00:32:34.370
JOHN DOLHUN: Forest fires.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.830
That would definitely be
a big source of mercury.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.860
Yeah.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.790
Anything else?

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.392
Yeah, Ryan?

00:32:45.392 --> 00:32:47.350
AUDIENCE: I mean, it's
definitely in the water,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.920
but like for [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.720
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.140
Yeah.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:52.640
Oh, yeah.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.920
It's in the dirt and
rocks and evaporating out.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.880
Yeah.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.100
I mean, another big source would
be volcanoes-- natural source.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.670
Yeah.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:07.260
So probably about 2/3 of it
comes from our fossil fuels

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.960
and a third of it comes
from natural sources.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.020
But once it gets
up there, once it's

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.350
in the atmosphere, this
elemental mercury--

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.740
there are plenty of things
up there that can oxidize it.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.540
There's ozone up there.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.090
There's hydroxide radicals.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.700
There's chlorine and
bromine in the troposphere.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:33.290
So this elemental mercury
gets oxidized to mercury 2.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.270
And then it rains outside.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.200
Right?

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.410
Where do you think that
mercury 2 goes when it rains?

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.800
It's coming down on us.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.300
Right?

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.430
It's going into the water.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.190
And once it gets
in the water there

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.120
are a couple of things
that can happen.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.530
It can have it can
be photoreduced here.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.680
And you can form the
elemental mercury back.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.870
And some of that can vaporize
back up into the atmosphere.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.330
Or the mercury too
can get down here

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.630
into the depths of the water.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.330
And this is where the
bad things happen.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.380
This is where the nasty
methyl mercury is formed.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.810
So once it gets down here we
know that mercury loves sulfur.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.199
So it can attach
itself to this--

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.230
there's plenty of hydrogen
sulfide in the water.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.469
It can attach itself to
the sulfur and form mercury

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.480
sulfide.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.219
And this is a neutral molecule.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.290
Being a neutral
molecule it can go right

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.150
through a bacterial cell wall.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.300
And once it's inside
of a bacteria--

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.909
there are some
bacteria down there

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.370
that produce methyl mercury.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.560
Nobody knows how it's done.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.210
They know that the
mercury sulfide goes in,

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.040
but they don't know
the exact mechanism.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.710
The other thing
that's not known is

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.050
that there are some
fish out there that

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:05.980
have millions of parts of
mercury in their systems,

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.860
much more than the
surrounding water.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.800
So there's got to be some
other sources of this methyl

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.130
mercury down there somewhere
that they haven't really

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.080
pinpointed.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.350
So once we get this
methyl mercury--

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.810
I just told you it loves sulfur.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.100
Right?

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.480
So you get this
stuff in the body--

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.020
this organic form of mercury.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:33.910
It's going to go for your
cysteine amino acids.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.530
And it forms a covalent
bond to the sulfur.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:45.990
So you've got this carboxy ethyl
sulfonyl methyl mercury here.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:50.640
Now you think about the
cysteine amino acids--

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.110
we've got them in our proteins.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.430
So this methyl mercury,
once it's inside of ourself

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:02.730
it can go for all the proteins
and infiltrate covalently bond

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.710
and hook up to all
these cysteines.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.900
Once we get methyl
mercury inside of us

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:16.040
from eating the fish,
it's like bioaccumulation.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.630
It's down the biofood chain.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.080
It starts with the plankton,
then the small fish,

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.800
and the bigger fish.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.980
Then we get it.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.010
This stuff-- 90% of
the methyl mercury

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:33.610
can actually come out of our
gut, get into our bloodstream,

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.480
and it can pass through
the blood brain barrier.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.380
So it gets into our
central nervous system

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.570
and can wreak havoc.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.270
It can also go
through the placenta.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:52.360
And the fetus is just in there.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.590
I mean, it's just developing.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.670
And once methyl
mercury gets in there

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:03.230
you can have total decontrol
of the whole thing.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.390
Everything can fall
apart for that.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.380
So this is really bad stuff.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.200
Now what we're going
to be doing in this lab

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.340
is actually we're going
to be detecting this

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.650
and we're going to be using our
new DMA 80 atomic absorption

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.420
spectrometer.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:29.100
And this spectrometer
operates under three things.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.310
There are three
things happening here.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:39.260
So we've got
thermal degradation.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.130
You've got amalgamation.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.900
And we've got atomic absorption.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:11.660
This spectrometer has two
detectors and three cells.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.920
It's called a tri cell.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.965
So on the nanogram scale
and the PPB scale--

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:31.140
one of the cells will
detect from about 0.01

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:41.250
to 10 nanograms, which
is like 0.1 to 100 PPB.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:47.850
The next cell will detect
between 10 and 20 nanograms,

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:52.290
which is 100 to 200 PPB.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:57.490
And the third cell will
pick up the last range

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:10.400
from 20 to 1,500 nanograms,
which is 200 to 15,000 PPB.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.190
The detection limit
of this machine

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.250
is to the thousandths
of a nanogram.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:25.970
So detects text down
to 0.001 nanogram.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.820
Can actually-- you're talking
almost a part per trillion

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.720
there with this machine.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.470
So it's really a
fantastic machine.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.545
So let's actually see
how this machine works.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.910
So this is a little
schematic of this machine.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:49.120
And I did this on ChemDraw.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.600
So ChemDraw is amazing.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.030
It is just-- you can do just
about anything with ChemDraw.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.880
So we've got a tank
of oxygen that you'll

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.840
see it sitting in the lab.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.670
And then we have this
autosampler, which

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.480
is a 40 position autosampler.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.010
And so we'll be massing
out our fish, putting it

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.720
into the autosampler.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.720
And then this little
pneumatic arm comes out,

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.690
grabs your sample out of
the autosampler, and inserts

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.420
it into this drying
decomposition oven.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.340
And the drying
decomposition oven

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.960
will heat the sample up to
about 650 degrees or so.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.730
And it combusts everything.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.720
And all of the combustion
products of your sample

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.530
are carried by the
stream of oxygen gas

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:46.010
into this catalyst tube furnace.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.650
Everything goes in
the catalyst tube.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:53.090
And that catalyst tube gets
heated up to about 500 degrees.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.760
And it pulls everything out--

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.320
literally all the NOxes, SOxes,
everything you can think of.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.040
Not only that, it converts
every mercury species,

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:10.380
including methyl mercury down
to the elemental mercury.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.890
The only thing that comes
out of that catalyst tube

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.900
is the elemental mercury.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.000
I know it's hard
to believe that,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.170
but everything else stays
in the catalyst tube.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.510
So the elemental
mercury comes out

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.630
and goes into a
gold amalgamator.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.200
And all it is a glass tube
filled with tiny gold beads.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.990
And the mercury comes
out, goes in there,

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.330
and sticks to those beads.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:45.370
Then this gold amalgamator is
flash heated up to 900 degrees.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.570
And bam!

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.210
You release the mercury vapor.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:52.360
And the vapor goes into
the atomic absorption

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.780
part of the instrument that
has our tri cells-- our three

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.730
cells.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.880
So we've got two mercury lamps.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.860
They're shining light
on the samples--

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.010
like 254 nanometers.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.890
And the light goes in,
shines on the sample,

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.830
and then we record the height
of the peak in the absorbance

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.270
that's going on.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.570
And we figure out
our concentrations

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.625
of the mercury in our samples.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.725
So this is a great machine.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.170
Do you guys have any
questions about this machine

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.615
or the ICP-MS?

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.860
There's no sample prep for
this machine, which is amazing.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.330
We can do solids,
liquids, or gases.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:53.190
And you can actually
follow your sample through.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.070
There's a system status
that you can turn on

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:58.020
and you can see your
sample traveling

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.340
through the various positions
while it's going through.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.610
It's pretty easy.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.320
Just three simple steps.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.370
You cut up your fishy.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:12.870
Right?

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:17.610
And we'll have several native
fish to the Charles River.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.050
So you'll be able to--

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:20.550
I know.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.170
It's not that bad.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.320
Maida.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.470
Don't pass out on me.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.690
No, it really won't be that bad.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.090
But you'll take your fish,
put a piece on the boat,

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.500
and weigh it--

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:41.780
mass it-- and then you type
your mass into the machine,

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:46.120
put it in the autosampler,
and that's pretty much goes.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.950
You're going to do this
on Monday and Tuesday.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.760
You'll do this at the
beginning and then

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.150
after that, you'll
make up your standards

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.850
for the phosphate lab.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.955
And you'll do the
phosphate testing.

00:43:59.955 --> 00:44:02.080
You'll go to the river and
get your bottle of water

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.980
for the phosphate.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.350
Any questions?

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.880
Yes, Autumn?

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.760
AUDIENCE: Is there any research
on how to remove mercury

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.360
from other animals or from us?

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.550
JOHN DOLHUN: They have--

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:23.200
there are certain
chemicals that you

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.330
could get prescribed
that would actually

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.270
chelate some of the mercury.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:28.840
Yeah.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.370
And chelate means
to latch on to it

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.930
and try to pull it out
of your bloodstream.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.430
Yeah.

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:44.290
I don't know anyone that's
actually been mercury poisoned

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.010
to that extent.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:53.050
But I know there are chemicals
that you can take that will

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.497
help mitigate some of that.

00:44:54.497 --> 00:44:54.997
Yeah.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:00.790
Other questions?

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.770
So when we're doing the
ICP-MS next Wednesday

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.960
and Thursday, we'll
have you-- you

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.130
can come in and
take a peek at it.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:19.950
You can look at the plasma.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.180
You'll see it lit up.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.450
And you can see the
signal on the screen--

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.620
how we're looking at
the signal and we're

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.950
getting it all ready
for your samples.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.330
I'll also have an associate
here from Agilent--

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.500
a PhD chemist who is
actually going to-- he

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.400
wanted to come
just for this lab.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.770
So I told him to come on.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:49.700
So he'll be a great source to
talk to when you're coming in.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.680
Yeah.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.180
Yeah.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.940
So I'm kind of excited
that you're the first group

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.350
to use this machine.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:59.230
And I think it'll
be exciting for you.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.690
I mean, the Charles
River is probably

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:09.140
the cleanest river in America.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.280
Yes.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.980
Believe it or not.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.880
But you know, there's still--

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.300
it has to be monitored.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.010
We still find problems
from time to time.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.800
So we will see
you up in the lab.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.310
And next week, Dr.
Sarah Hewett will

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.480
start a new series of lectures.

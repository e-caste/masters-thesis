00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:21.960
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.530
We have talked in the last
class about magnetic trapping.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.910
Today, I want to finish our
discussion on magnetic traps

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.300
with two demonstrations
of classical forms

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880
of magnetic trapping.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.590
But I told you that
magnetic trapping

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.010
is a purely
classical phenomenon.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.490
The only quantum
mechanical aspect

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.030
is that this angle at which
the magnetic dipole is oriented

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.370
with the magnetic
field is quantized.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.785
I also mentioned
to you, and this

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:01.620
was Wilks' Theorem, that
the total magnetic field can

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.150
have only local
minima, not maxima.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.540
And therefore, we you can
do magnetic trapping only

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.570
for weak field seeking states.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.170
These are states which
lower their energy

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.370
with photomagnetic fields.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.020
And as a result,
since the spin is up,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.090
the magnetic moment
is anti-parallel

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.440
to the magnetic
field, those states

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.240
can always lower their
energy by flipping the spin.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.650
I know it's a simple
demonstration,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.980
but, well, I can't bring
a real magnetic trap

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.450
into the classroom.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.320
So what I have here, this is
just two little ring magnets,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.570
refrigerator magnets.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.430
And there is a tube.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.520
So I just want to demonstrate
the one dimensional

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.980
form of magnetic
trapping to you.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.160
And this is our atom.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.550
It's in strong
magnet, elongated,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.510
and it can be spin up
or it can be spin down.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.370
So what you're seeing is now
you're seeing the two magnets.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.780
And you're seeing
our dipole, our atom,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.070
which is in a stable
trapping configuration.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.910
And you can-- am I blocking it?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.210
You can see that it's
stable by-- I just move it.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.320
And you see how it
always comes back.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.780
So that's one position.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.630
I pull it over.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.350
Here, you have a second position
where our magnet is trapped.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.260
Here is a third one.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110
And here's a fourth one.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.880
So there are four
positions where

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.570
we have one
dimensional trapping.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.410
Well, this is one
for one orientation.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.330
Now I take the magnet
and flip it over.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.680
So we are changing now
in the laboratory frame.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.830
The sign of the magnetic moment.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.270
And there is actually
a very nice minimum.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.580
You see how clearly
it is trapped.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.110
There is one here in the middle.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.920
I can also just show
you, it really stays put.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.870
There's a weak restoring force.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.720
And then here's number three.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.400
So it seems very, very rich.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.000
I've shown you seven
different minima

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.400
where trapping has happened.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.020
And well, just to fill you
in, if this is our magnet,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.350
these are ring magnets,
the magnetic field

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.560
is about something like that.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.950
And if I plot the magnetic
field for this configuration,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.270
I find indeed that
for one orientation,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.520
there are four maxima.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.040
So for one orientation--
just give me one second.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.870
Yeah, there are four maxima
of the magnetic field

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.710
for this orientation.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.360
And therefore, there
are four minima

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.820
of the trapping potential.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.110
So maybe I should have
shown it like this.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.110
There are one, two,
three, four minima.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.530
And for the opposite
configuration,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.300
there are one, two,
three trapping minima.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.090
But now if you look, there are
one, two, three, four, five,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.870
six ones marked in red, which
are for strong field seekers,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.240
because these are maxima
at the magnetic field.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.170
And there is only one
where the magnetic field

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.260
has a local minimum.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.140
So in the last
part, I have shown

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.250
you the absolute value
of the magnetic field.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.070
And you realize there are
one, two, three, four, five,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.340
six maxima.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.440
And this is responsible for
six trapping configurations.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.230
And the seventh one was a
minimum of the magnetic field.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.450
So in one dimension,
there is no problem.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.070
In one dimension, I can
get a restoring force

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.880
for the strong and for
the weak field seeker

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.540
for any orientation of
the magnetic dipole.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.820
But if we want to have a
three dimensional trap,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.860
we have to look at the
three dimensional stability.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.240
And it would be only
this one configuration,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.700
which can be
stabilised in x and y.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.950
What I've shown you
are symmetric fields.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.190
So all these minima and
maxima only settle points.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.950
They trap in one dimension.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.190
But with suitable
radial magnetic field,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.040
you could turn this one
here into a real three

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.210
dimensional trap.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.840
But the other ones you cannot,
because this would violate

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.610
Wilks' Theorem.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.900
I find it amazing that
this demonstration

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.550
has seven different magnetic
trapping configurations.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.460
That's just how it
turns out to be.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.130
Questions?

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.046
Collin.

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:26.837
AUDIENCE: So if you
look at the clover leaf

00:06:26.837 --> 00:06:35.846
coil, the parts of the field
that sort of axial [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:39.270
provided by [INAUDIBLE],
those are the inner coils?

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so if you
look at a clover leaf trap,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.730
the pinch coils
create such a minimum,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.020
which provides confinement
in the z direction.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.750
But then you add a field, a
radially outward quadrupole

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.745
field, and that overcomes--
in this demonstration,

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:01.120
everything is
actually symmetric.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.040
So this is a minimum
for this direction.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.140
But if you would now plot it
as a function of x and y and z,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.760
it would be a saddle point.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.800
So this configuration
is trapping along z,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.600
but anti-trapping along x and y.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.450
But if you add a
quadrupole field,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.470
a linear field which points
outward with these clover

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.720
leaves or the [INAUDIBLE]
bars, then they

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.960
would provide confinement,
which is stronger

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.840
than the anti-confinement
of the saddle point.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.580
If you look at some equations
I showed you in the last class,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.940
you will actually see
that in one of the slides,

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.860
I had the expression
for the magnetic field,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.050
where you see how
the [INAUDIBLE] bars,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.930
the radially linear
confinement overcomes

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:53.230
the anti-trapping feature
of the settle point.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.920
Other question?

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:03.360
Then finally, let me give you a
demonstration for the following

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.940
effect.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.600
I mentioned to you that
magnetic traps become unstable

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.830
when the magnetic
field is very low.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.360
And I told you, well, at
very low magnetic field,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.810
the energy difference
between spin up and spin down

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.350
is very small.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.900
At zero magnetic
field, it becomes zero.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.320
And then, the atom cannot
adiabatically stay in its MF

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.970
state, because we can violate
the adiabaticity condition.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.850
So let me now show you
an example of purely

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.659
classical trapping.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.690
And I think a number of you
now have seen the levitron toy.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.340
Actually, a few years ago when
my group was one of the first

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.900
to use magnetic trapping,
in every single talk

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.150
I explained how
magnetic trap worked.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.050
And I even showed this
demonstration live.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.470
But in order to
demonstrate it really well,

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.460
I was building my own levitron.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.950
I used machine parts.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.490
I used the motor drive.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.970
So I hope I can show you
one aspect of the levitron

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:12.010
demonstration, which
is usually not known.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.880
So let me first give
you the punchline.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.020
Magnetic trapping happens
with an orientation

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.810
of the magnetic dipole
which could always

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.230
lower its energy
by flipping over.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.140
The reason why it
doesn't flip over-- well,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.770
quantum mechanically,
it adiabatically

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.920
stays in a quantum
state-- but classically,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.920
if we have angular momentum, it
is gyroscopically stabilized.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.220
The dipole cannot flip over,
because it's a gyroscope.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.950
It has angular momentum.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.750
And actually, it also
has angular momentum

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.610
in quantum physics.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.650
So the two explanations
sounded different

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.290
when I said stays
in a quantum state,

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.800
is gyroscopically stabilized.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.220
But if you think
about it more deeply,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.440
they have much more in common
than my language suggests.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.190
So I think you know
how the levitron works.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.250
You spin up the magnet.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.890
And I had this nice
motor tool to spin it up.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.220
And when you have
prepared the system.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.940
Your atom has now-- atom in
quotes-- angular momentum

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.170
in the magnetic moment.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.870
And you bring it to the position
where the three dimensional

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.630
magnetic field fulfills
the stability condition.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.380
And you can now enjoy
magnetic trapping.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.830
This is exactly what your
atoms do in your magnetic trap.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.415
It is gyroscopically
stabilized magnetic levitation.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.020
The only difference is that
gravity has to be compensated.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.770
Gravity is a major player.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.040
So the stability point
in the three dimensional

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.440
magnetic field configuration
includes the compensation

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.040
for gravity.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.250
But I have to say, my group
was also at some point

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.430
trapping a Bose-Einstein
condensate in a few hertz

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.450
weak trap, where gravity was
the strongest force of all.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.990
So what you have seen is
an exact demonstration

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.800
of the principle for
magnetic trapping.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.490
But now comes my question.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.440
What would you
expect, what would

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:19.070
happen to our magnetic trap when
we spin the levitron faster?

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.860
Does it help or does it hurt to
spin up the levitron, to spin

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.800
up the gyroscope, to
higher angular velocities?

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.790
So three possibility.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.480
Nothing happens.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.670
It doesn't matter
as long as it spins.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.070
The second one, the trap
becomes more stable.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.590
The third possibility,
the trap becomes unstable.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.560
Do you want to
offer any opinion?

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.636
Collin.

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:02.760
AUDIENCE: Well, we have an
angular momentum, right,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.636
of the really large omega.

00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:07.548
When you apply
torque, it's going

00:12:07.548 --> 00:12:09.938
to get torque
[INAUDIBLE], right.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.850
It's going to be the
prefactor of omega.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:17.389
So we have a giant omega, we
imagine that [INAUDIBLE] small,

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:18.383
[INAUDIBLE] torques.

00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:22.359
No, no, no wait a second.

00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:23.400
I did this the other way.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.350
It was [? healing. ?]
Never mind.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.750
PROFESSOR: So do we have
to do the experiment?

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.680
Maybe.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.900
So now I put the motor
controller to full speed.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.830
And I speed it up much faster.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.672
You can hear the sound.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.380
I really want to do
a careful experiment.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.830
So we wait until everything
is quiet and has died out.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.100
And now, we want to try if we
can can do magnetic trapping.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.920
And you see it's impossible.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.060
The system, when it
reaches the point where

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.840
magnetic trapping would
occur, it's unstable.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.230
But then, well, just to
prove that it is only

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.420
the speed of rotation which
has caused the instability,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.370
I just wait until
friction has slowed down

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.800
the angular velocity.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.040
And now again, it
works perfectly.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:14.860
So you see, if you rotate the
gyroscope too fast, it's bad.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.850
It makes the magnetic
trap unstable.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.340
Convinced?

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.560
How would you explain that?

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.020
If we have a gyro-- Collin?

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.520
AUDIENCE: Why aren't we working
in the limit where we assume

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.885
that the magnetic field
generated by our magnet

00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:53.795
is sort of weak
compared to the trap.

00:13:53.795 --> 00:13:57.700
So the magnet's really
modifying [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.700
PROFESSOR: No, we
assume here-- and I

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.660
can give you the
analysis-- but yes.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.320
No, these are permanent magnets.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.400
So the floating magnet is just,
you can say, a probe, a test

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.760
object which is put into
the permanent magnetic field

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.458
of the stronger magnets
of the stationary magnet.

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:19.452
AUDIENCE: Get an
additional torque

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:22.446
to-- because it gets
an additional force

00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:23.943
into the upper state.

00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:27.935
So it gets an additional
torque in towards the center.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.069
PROFESSOR: It's not necessarily
the additional torque.

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:37.360
Let's put two things together,
it's really fascinating,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.780
from different principles.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:45.070
The first thing is
magnetic trapping

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.586
requires-- if you
have a magnetic trap

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.460
and you have an
inhomogeneous magnetic field.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.100
And of course, you need an
inhomogeneous magnetic field,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.810
the angle cosine theta
between the spinning dipole

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.240
and the magnetic field
should stay the same.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.190
And this means
quantum mechanically,

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.990
we stay in the
same quantum state.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.900
So therefore, a
magnetic trap only

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.560
works because the
rapidly precessing spin,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.430
when the magnetic
field always precesses

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.770
around the magnetic field.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.930
And when the
magnetic field tips,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.170
the precession keeps the
dipole, the magnetic moment,

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.520
aligned with the magnetic field.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.380
Now, what happens in a gyroscope
with a precession frequency

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.160
when you spin the
gyroscope faster?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.700
We've seen that in your
classical mechanical

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.530
demonstration, if you had
the spinning gyroscope, which

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.490
was only [INAUDIBLE]
suspended with one rope.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.260
And then it was precessing
in the Earth magnetic field.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.010
Does this precession
frequency get faster or slower

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.570
when you spin the
gyroscope faster?

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.670
Pardon?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.050
When the gyroscope
spins faster, what

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.312
happens to the
precession frequency?

00:16:04.312 --> 00:16:05.720
AUDIENCE: Slower.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.870
PROFESSOR: Slower.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:10.340
Because the torque per unit
time adds some angular momentum.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.430
This angular momentum adds to
the existing angular momentum.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.510
But the more angular
momentum exists,

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.760
the smaller is the change.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.620
And this lowers the precession.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.920
I can give you another example.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.430
If you rotate a coin.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.170
When does the coin really
wobble very, very quickly?

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.000
Just when it has slowed
down and is about to fall.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.990
And this rapid wobbling is
the precession frequency.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.660
So the lower the gyroscopic
angular momentum is,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.640
angular velocity is, the faster
is the precession frequency.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.070
And fast precession is important
for adiabatic following.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.700
So in other words, what you
saw here in this demonstration

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.640
was a classical analogy
for Majorana Flops.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.780
Now, if we would translate from
our classical demonstration

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:06.420
to a real atom,
what feature, what

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.470
parameter characterizing
the atom, are we changing?

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:15.569
So when I spin
the magnet faster,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.300
what would that correspond
to in atomic properties?

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.036
AUDIENCE: Higher mu.

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:22.910
PROFESSOR: Higher mu?

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.030
I'm not changing the
permanent magnetic moment

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.339
of the magnet by spinning
it faster-- higher

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.640
angular momentum.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.145
But in this the equation, what
corresponds to higher angular

00:17:32.145 --> 00:17:32.645
momentum?

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:38.174
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
omega alpha,

00:17:38.174 --> 00:17:41.030
the precession frequency
around the static beam field?

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.780
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.860
But what I mean-- so
the Larmor frequency,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.110
this is a precision
frequency, becomes lower.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.750
So what becomes lower
in the atomic property?

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.910
AUDIENCE: Sort of the
external magnetic--

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.660
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.060
AUDIENCE: h bar?

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.950
PROFESSOR: No, let's not
mess around with h bar here.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.210
h bar is given by nature.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.680
We can't change that.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.040
But, I mean, OK.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.990
Multiple choice.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.370
B, no, no, no, no.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:09.870
It's g.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.730
Yeah, it's g.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.750
So what you have seen is, you've
seen a demonstration where

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:19.050
in front of your eyes, I've
changed the atomic g factor.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.270
And now you sort of see,
let me put it together.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.530
What happens is, the
mechanical magnet

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.720
has a given magnetic moment.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.030
And if I put much more
angular momentum into it,

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.790
it can sort of-- it has,
quantum mechanically,

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.870
speaking more
intermediate states.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.080
Because it can change
its angular momentum

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.280
in steps of one.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.630
So if I spin it faster, it has
many more intermediate states.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:48.470
And each energy separation
has become smaller.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.110
And smaller energy
separation means

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:56.760
I'm getting closer to degeneracy
where adiabaticity breaks down.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.160
Anyway, think about it.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.281
The analogy is really deep.

00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:01.780
Questions?

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.770
OK.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:20.050
So that's all I wanted to tell
you about magnetic trapping.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:20.550
Collin.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.920
AUDIENCE: When you increase
the angular momentum,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.030
you don't necessarily change
the spacing between the levels,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.900
though.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.483
PROFESSOR: No.

00:19:26.483 --> 00:19:29.410
The energy levels is when
the magnet is aligned,

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.750
it has an energy absolute
value of mu times b.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.550
Here, it has minus absolute
value of mu times b.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.940
And mu is simply the magnetic
moment of the permanent magnet.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.230
So I go from here to there.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.290
And the number of
energy levels in between

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.140
is the total angular
momentum divided by h bar.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:57.320
So when I give it more angular
momentum, in one energy level,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.320
in one transition, there is less
energy which will be released.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.060
And it is actually, you
can say, the big note

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.090
between energy levels,
or the difference

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.660
between energy levels,
which is a Larmor frequency.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.310
So therefore, the precession,
quantum mechanically,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.130
is the energy difference
between adjacent energy levels.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.610
And if you give it
more angular momentum,

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.550
this energy difference
becomes smaller.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.410
And this low precession
frequency, this small energy

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.465
difference, is bad
for adiabaticity.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.639
Yes.

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:41.597
AUDIENCE: Does that have much
of an effect on f equals 1

00:20:41.597 --> 00:20:42.583
and f equals 2?

00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:45.050
Do you get more
[INAUDIBLE] if f equals 2?

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.340
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.470
In f equals 2, we have
twice the magnetic movement

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.560
than in f equals 1.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.310
But in f equals 2,
we have five levels.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.050
In f equals 1, we
have three levels.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.515
So the--

00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:06.950
AUDIENCE: Is it that
significant of a difference?

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.100
PROFESSOR: So I think
it just cancels out.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.870
The g factor-- I
showed you the formula.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.450
What matters really
is the g factor.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:19.310
And the g factor on
f equals 2 is 1/2.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.430
In f equals minus
1, it's minus 1/2.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.555
What happens is
the magnetic moment

00:21:25.555 --> 00:21:29.570
in f equals 2 is larger,
because everything is stretched.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.660
All angular momenta are aligned.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.600
But the multiplicity--
you have five levels

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.090
versus three levels-- and
the two effects just cancel.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.180
Other questions?

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.680
Yes.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.940
AUDIENCE: What breaks the system
when the magnet spinning gets

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.790
slower and slower.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.690
Now we know why it destabilizes
when you spin it too fast.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.650
But if you don't spin it at
all, it also floats, right?

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.820
PROFESSOR: OK, what
happens is yes.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.320
If I stop spinning it,
it will no longer work.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.840
So what we have is we have
a hierarchy of frequencies.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.670
The fastest frequency has to
be the spinning frequency.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.800
Then we have the
trapping frequency.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.760
And the precession
frequency is one

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.667
over the spinning frequency.

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:20.375
So you want that the
precession frequency

00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:24.140
is between spinning
and one over spinning,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.200
because this is the precession.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.080
And if you would
take the spinning

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.391
to lower and lower values, you
would violate that hierarchy.

00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:34.890
Yes.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.670
OK, evaporative cooling.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.590
Evaporative cooling is a
powerful cooling scheme

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.550
to reach nanokelvin.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.200
Actually, I forgot
to update this slide.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.200
I wanted to say, this
is the only technique

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.010
so far to reach
quantum degeneracy

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.700
for bosons and fermions.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.400
Very recently, people have
demonstrated laser cooling

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.770
of atomic strontium
to quantum degeneracy.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.560
But if you read the paper,
it was laser cooling

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.790
aided not by
evaporative cooling,

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.410
but by collisional
distribution of atoms.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.610
It's likely evaporation
where you evaporate into--

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.250
and you keep-- read the paper.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:18.750
It's--

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:30.710
The scheme only worked
because collisions--

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.470
how to say-- you cooled one
region and another region

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.800
was cooled by collisions.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.682
And this brings you
pretty much back

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:39.140
to further [INAUDIBLE]
evaporation.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.590
Anyway, what I want to say
is there is a small footnote.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.470
The field is evolving.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.390
You can find now paper's
laser cooling to be easy.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.960
But if you read the
paper carefully,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.810
or if you talk to
me, I will tell you

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.780
that there were still
collisions necessary,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.180
the same kind of
collisions which

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.070
drive the reparative cooling.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.620
But before we go into an expert
discussion about variants

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.139
of evaporate cooling,
I should first

00:24:02.139 --> 00:24:03.680
tell you what
evaporative cooling is.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.270
But somebody raised his hand.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.238
AUDIENCE: Oh, no I
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:11.682
AUDIENCE: You wrote the paper
on [INAUDIBLE], for example,

00:24:11.682 --> 00:24:16.110
that if your quantum
degeneracy [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:21.550
And that would be just
purely laser cooling, right?

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.030
PROFESSOR: Sub-recoil
cooling has not--

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.570
any form of laser cooling to
sub-recoil temperatures was not

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.190
compatible with high
atomic densities.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.420
It only worked at
such low densities

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.460
that they stayed far away
from quantum degeneracy.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.250
So nanokelvin, yes.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.970
Temperature in the
nanokelvin range

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.110
his been reached
by laser cooling,

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.730
but not at sufficiently
high densities.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.760
The densities, high
density, causes collisions.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.670
Those collisions are
screwing up laser

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.870
cooling that it
doesn't work anymore.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.920
And the only technique which can
reach nanokelvin temperatures

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.610
at sufficiently high density
is evaporative cooling.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.270
And that applies to strontium.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.350
Strontium was laser
cooled at low density,

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.280
and then the low temperature
was collisionally

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.270
transferred to high
density region.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:15.270
So you can say, in a way,
it's an oddity of nature

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.640
that we are now using
quantum gases to reveal

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.910
new features of quantum
physics using ultra-cold atoms.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.980
But the cooling
techniques which gets us

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.140
into the quantum
degenerate regime

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.090
is pretty much classical.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.130
So this is a cartoon
picture how you

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.690
could think evaporative
cooling works.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.160
You have a thermal distribution.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.940
You remove the high energy tail
of the thermal distribution.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.850
And then, you allow the
distribution to relax.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.360
And it will relax to a
Boltzmann distribution, which

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.390
is a little bit shifted
towards the cold,

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.270
or the low energy, side
compared to the original dash

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.890
distribution.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.480
And if you do it again
and again and again, you

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.120
wind up with a
distribution of atoms which

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.390
is colder and colder, because
every time you axe away

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.730
the high energy tail,
you remove atoms

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.580
which have, on average, more
than the average energy.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.350
And therefore, the
average energy per atom

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.140
drops and drops and drops.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.320
Of course, the atom
number also drops rapidly.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.800
And I was only able
to draw it in this way

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.600
because I've been on-- I
think I-- actually, did

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.280
I. I forget what the
normalization here

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.360
is in the plot.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.770
AUDIENCE: What is n?

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.460
PROFESSOR: n is a
number of steps.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.470
So after 25 removals of the
high energy tail, I'm here.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:49.250
And after 50, I have a very,
very narrow distribution.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.470
So it tells you already
something very powerful,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.590
which people were
not fully aware

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.600
before evaporative cooling
of atoms was invented,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.410
that it doesn't take so long.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.840
It doesn't take so many steps.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.090
It takes 50
rethermalization steps.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.700
And each rethermalization
takes two or three

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.540
elastic collisions.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.610
So what this already
demonstrates,

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.220
if you can keep your
atoms and evaporatively

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.210
cool by removing the
high energy atom,

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.256
after a time which
corresponds to a few hundred

00:27:21.256 --> 00:27:24.780
elastic collision times, just
a few hundred collisions,

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.605
you can go way down
in temperature.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.660
So if you have this, I actually
used this cartoon picture

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.630
to write one of the-- to
develop a mathematical model

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.060
for evaporative cooling,
which is still the simplest

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.570
model for evaporative
cooling which

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.560
you can find in the literature.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.130
So in any event,
but if you think

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.160
in that way, every
time you remove

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.710
a few percent of the
atoms, you realize

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.820
that you should think
in a logarithmic way.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.110
Every time you lose a certain
percentage of your atoms,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.690
you decrease the temperature
by a certain percentage.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.800
So in the end, if you think
either in discrete steps

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.430
or continuously as
a function of time,

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.010
things should happen
exponentially.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:15.270
So if you want to characterize
what happens into this system,

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.340
we should correlate
the percentage

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.450
of temperature change
to the percentage

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.930
of the change in number.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.840
And here we have a coefficient.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.080
And this coefficient
would give us

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.130
an exponential-- would
give us the power law, how

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.140
temperature and
number are related.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.550
Or mathematically alpha, which
characterizes how much cooling

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.500
do you get for which
loss in the atom number

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:43.610
is the logarithmic derivative
of number with temperature.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:49.630
All other quantities also scale
as power loss of the number.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.680
Let me just assume we
are in a potential.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.160
We have T dimensions.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.720
So if you have an harmonic
oscillator, it's r square.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.500
If you have a linear
trap, it's r to the one.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.630
And for reasons
for simplicity, I

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.930
took d, the number
of dimensions, out.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:10.100
So you choose delta
to get the 1d, 2d,

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.546
or whatever to get a harmonic
oscillator or linear potential.

00:29:14.546 --> 00:29:19.620
OK, Because of equal
partition, the temperature,

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.740
which is a measure
for kinetic energy,

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.910
is equal to the
potential energy.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.860
And the potential energy is
r to the power d over delta.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.380
So therefore, the size
of the atoms in the trap

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.340
scales with temperature
with the power law.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.780
But if the temperature
scales with the power law

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:43.770
over the number, then the volume
of the atoms, the temperature,

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.540
everything scales with
the number of atoms

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.450
to some exponent.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.660
So everything is
sort of exponential

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.610
according to power laws.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:58.160
So I mentioned already, the
volume and what I've shown here

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.700
is just the three
parameters which determine--

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.720
or the two parameters-- which
determine all exponential.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.880
The volume goes with the
product of delta alpha.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.870
The density goes with something.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.790
The phase space density is
density over temperature

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.100
to the 3/2.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.230
The collision rate
is n sigma v. So

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:24.490
everything scales
with n to the alpha.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.080
And all the coefficients
are given here.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.210
So the question
is, what is alpha?

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.860
So it seems delta is
our trapping potential.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.210
Once we know alpha, we
have a clear prediction

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.560
what evaporative
cooling can do for us.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.730
Well, alpha was,
remember, it told us

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.170
how much we lower
temperature or energy

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.720
when we lose a number of atoms.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.510
So therefore, all we
have to figure out

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.780
is, when we evaporate
an atom, how much energy

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.610
does it take with it?

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.600
And therefore, alpha will
be determined by some people

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.110
call it the knife edge.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.910
If you truncate the
trap at eta kt--

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.650
I showed you a cartoon
where I used the x

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.570
to chop off the tail of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:20.740
at 4kt.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.700
So eta would have been 4.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.380
So this is what we
control experimentally.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.380
At what energy do we allow
atoms to leak out of the trap.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.030
All right.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.690
So if you set a threshold
of, let's say, 4kt,

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.690
4kt is the minimum energy
for atoms to leak out.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.730
But some will be a
little bit faster.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.980
In other words, they are
not creeping over the edge.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.370
They are jumping, they
are zipping over the edge.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.380
But because
everything is thermal,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.600
this extra energy is on
the order of kt, or 1/2 kt.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.960
And in the first analysis,
we can neglect it.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.840
So in other words, we can
say that each atom, when

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.590
it escapes, takes away
the energy eta kt.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:10.180
And eta is the
famous eta parameter,

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.920
which we determine
experimentally

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.780
when we evaporate.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.160
Any questions so far?

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.110
Right now, I've pretty much
gone through definitions.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.190
And now, I simply look
at energy conservation.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.170
So now let's look at what
is the change of energy

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.030
during evaporation.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:36.990
Well, for n atoms, this
is the kinetic energy.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.650
And the extra potential energy
for harmonic oscillator,

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:41.680
it would be the same.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.200
Equal partition for
another power law potential

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.800
that we have to introduce
as delta parameter, which

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.520
defines the power law of
the trapping potential.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:59.500
So that means the following,
that originally, this

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.200
describes the number
of the total energy.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.310
After an evaporation
step, delta N is negative.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.300
I've lost some atoms
and delta T is negative.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.560
I am now at a lower temperature
and a lower atom number.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.530
And the difference is
simply the energy taken away

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.045
by the number of atoms
TN which have evaporated.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.860
So with that, by
just rewriting that,

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.410
I get a result for
the alpha coefficient.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.320
The alpha coefficient,
which tells

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.630
us what is the percentage
in temperature which--

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.200
how many percent
is the temperature

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.640
lowered when I lose
a certain percentage

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.160
of the number of atoms.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.870
Actually, 1% drop of
the number of atoms

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.554
gives alpha percent in
change in temperature.

00:33:49.554 --> 00:33:50.970
And this is the
alpha coefficient.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.380
So I have an analytic
expression for that.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:01.050
And sure, you realize
if you put your cut eta

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.180
not at high energy, if
you cut at lower energy,

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.830
than your alpha coefficient
can even turn negative.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.760
Because then, the
atoms which evaporate

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.100
do not have more than
the average energy.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.210
But actually, then
the model breaks down.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.330
OK.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.560
So alpha characterizes how much
more than the average energy

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.590
is removed by escaping atoms.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.083
So [INAUDIBLE] are
very simple once we

00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:34.150
know what is the threshold
of the trap, eta kt.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.699
At what energy do
we leak out atoms?

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:40.120
We have a complete description
what is the energy, the phase

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.449
space density, and such
and such after we've

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:44.750
lost a number of atoms.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.889
But you realize, at
least for all of you

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.060
who do the experiment,
something is missing here

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.770
that sounds almost too ideal.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:51.810
We just evaporate.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:57.685
And we can freely peek
what is the energy,

00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:59.570
or what is the energy
threshold and such.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.870
The experiment is
more constrained.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.230
And we have to
work harder to get

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.900
into this good regime
of evaporation.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.050
But let me introduce the
experimental constraint which

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.540
is very important by asking
the question how efficient can

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.150
evaporative cooling be?

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.490
So based on the
idealistic model,

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.800
which I've presented to you
so far, what is the highest

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.835
efficiency of evaporation
you can imagine?

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.680
Collin.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.584
AUDIENCE: I guess in principle,
you could remove just one atom.

00:35:34.584 --> 00:35:36.985
Then you'd save [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:37.610
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:38.940
You remove one atom.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.980
You wait until you
have one atom, which

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.350
has pretty much all the
energy of the system.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.790
One atom evaporates
and your whole system

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.510
is as cold as you
want to have it.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.450
Of course, you are all
laughing because this

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.865
will take much longer
than the dwell time

00:35:54.865 --> 00:35:56.920
of a graduate student at MIT.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.240
In other words, what you
realize, time is a premium.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.510
And it's not just the dwell
time of a graduate student.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.080
It's not your patience.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.430
What happens is in a real
experiment, there are losses.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.390
There is some form
of technical heating.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.640
Since you don't have
a perfect vacuum,

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.050
residual gas coalitions
cause losses.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.390
And its clear you have a time
budget which is set by losses.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.290
And either you evaporate
in this time budget,

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.890
or you've lost your
atoms for other reasons.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:33.810
So that's now what
we want to bring in.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.900
We can't make a realistic
model of evaporative cooling

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.040
without putting in the
constraint of time.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:45.860
And the time constraint is
usually determined by losses,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.300
by unavoidable atom losses.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.874
So now we want to
understand what

00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:52.040
is the speed of evaporation.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.960
So we assume.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.595
We truncate.

00:36:58.595 --> 00:37:05.370
We remove an amount dT dN of
atoms above this threshold.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.030
And then the question is,
how fast can we do it again?

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.520
How long does it
take for collisions

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.420
to replace the tail of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution?

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:26.080
But now, you can make
an analytic model.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.340
I was very pleased when I saw
that it is so easy to actually

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.650
get a precise analytic
model of that.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.860
If either in the asymptotic
limit that eta is very high,

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.670
the number of collisions,
there is a certain number

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.950
of collisions which
replenish the tail.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.940
And you want to know
how fast does it happen.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.570
But now you can
use detail balance.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.090
In an equilibrium
situation, those atoms

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:56.240
will collide live with the
bulk of the distribution.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.450
And because they are in a
highly improbable state,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.670
most of the outcomes
of the collision

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.870
will put those
energetic atoms back

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.160
into the bulk of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.090
So therefore, the
number of particles

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:17.140
which arrive in this
tail in equilibrium

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.770
is identical to the
number of particles

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.620
which will leave this tail.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.240
And so all we have
to do is we have

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.690
to calculate how many
such collisions happen.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.190
This is an expression for
the fraction of atoms,

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.220
with the exponential
Boltzmann factor,

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.610
which you can find in this tail.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.310
And those atoms collide
with a velocity,

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.590
which is not the
thermal velocity.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.670
The velocity is larger
by square root eta,

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:48.430
because those are fast.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.600
So by simply multiplying
the fraction of the atoms

00:38:51.600 --> 00:39:00.780
with the collision rate, we find
how many atoms per unit time

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.840
are removed from this tail.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.245
And in detail balance, it
means the same number of atoms

00:39:06.245 --> 00:39:08.650
is replenished into the tail.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.290
So if you now switch
to a continuous model

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.730
of evaporation,
where we constantly

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:16.120
evaporate the atoms
which are produced

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.630
through elastic collisions with
an energy larger than eta kt,

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:25.830
then this here is our
rate of evaporation.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.830
Since we want to think in
terms of time constant,

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.330
this rate of
evaporation is described

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:35.010
by a time constant
for evaporation.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.290
And this time constant
is now expressed here

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.960
by our experimental
control parameter eta.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.328
Nancy.

00:39:44.328 --> 00:39:47.821
AUDIENCE: So when we are saying
that the collisions are putting

00:39:47.821 --> 00:39:50.680
atoms back into the
lower velocity states,

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.323
are we saying that the
collisions are more

00:39:53.323 --> 00:39:56.790
defined than Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution?

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.958
So when you let the
system [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:01.990
it automatically goes into a new
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.797
and that's what
determines the tail.

00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:06.323
But then we are saying that
the collisions are putting

00:40:06.323 --> 00:40:08.687
the atoms on the table back
into the lower velocities.

00:40:08.687 --> 00:40:12.110
So the collisions
are not [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.467
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution?

00:40:14.467 --> 00:40:15.050
PROFESSOR: No.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:19.620
We assume here that
the truncation is only

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.680
weakly perturbing the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.940
And at least the easiest
way to figure out

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:31.350
how many atoms are
produced per unit time,

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.260
if atoms in this truncated
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.850
collide, they produce, with
a certain time constant,

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.090
atoms which will
populate the tail.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:45.290
And I can estimate what is
this number of atoms which

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:48.070
are per unit time
fed into the tail

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.190
by assuming I do not have
a truncated Boltzmann

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.860
distribution.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.440
I have a full
Boltzmann distribution.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.520
And I simply calculate what
is the total elastic collision

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.070
rate of the atoms in this tail.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.310
So in other words,
I want to know

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.870
how many atoms are
fed into the tail.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:12.620
I get this number of collisions
by saying in detail balance,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.360
this number of
collisions is the same

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.770
as the number of collisions
in the full Boltzmann

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.180
distribution which
goes backward.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.150
And with that argument,
I can immediately

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.660
write down an
expression for what

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.760
is the collision rate which
produces high energy atoms.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.860
Think about it.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.490
It's subtle, but it's
fairly straightforward.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.570
I make the assumption here
that eta is sufficiently large,

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:45.090
that I can use properties of the
equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:48.670
distribution to estimate
those eight constants.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:52.260
And actually, when I found
the analytic expression,

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.220
I could compare to theory,
which was much more complicated

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.530
and used truncated
Boltzmann distribution.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.770
And in the asymptotic
limit of large eta,

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.950
I was in full agreement
with the other results.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.400
So yes, we have
an expression now

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.550
for the time constant
of evaporation,

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.430
how fast evaporation happens
because of elastic collisions

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.740
which populate the
high energy tail.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.030
But usually, when you
have a time constant,

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:27.100
you want to express it
by another physical time.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.860
And the physical time
which characterizes a gas

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.550
is the rate of elastic
collisions per atom in a gas.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:40.490
So therefore, I want to express
the rate for evaporation.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:44.920
The rate at which atoms are
produced in the high energy

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.620
tail is a ratio
lambda with the time

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.450
between elastic collisions.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:56.150
And so we realize, of
course, that the atoms which

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.580
have enough energy
to evaporate are not

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.970
produced in every
elastic collisions.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.190
Actually, there is an
exponential factor e

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.770
to the eta, because
it's only a small part

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.400
of those elastic
collisions which

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.090
happen which produces an high
energy atom which can escape.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.670
OK, so with that, we
know how many atoms

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.810
we can lose by evaporation.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:24.710
And this is our expression.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:30.180
But now we have a complete
pretty realistic but wonderful

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:34.470
toy model to discuss all
aspects of evaporative cooling.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.310
We have our control
parameter eta,

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:41.700
which sets the threshold at
which atoms can evaporate.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.670
And this factor eta determines
the two relevant parameters--

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.190
alpha, which is the
efficiency of evaporation,

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:54.070
and lambda, which is the
speed of evaporation.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:58.200
If we set eta very high,
following Collin's suggestion,

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:07.040
we can put it so high that one
lost atom, one evaporated atom,

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.870
can cool all the other atoms
to very low temperature.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.890
But we know that this
would take too much time.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:15.850
So in other words,
we have a compromise.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:19.930
If you set eta very high,
each atom which evaporates

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.010
provides a lot of cooling power.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.520
But high eta means we
have exponential slow down

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.950
in the evaporation rate.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.080
And we have to wait
longer and longer,

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.150
or we never get into evaporation
because inelastic collisions

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.960
and losses has taken its effect.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.850
So therefore, it seems
clear that this interplay

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:47.250
between efficiency and speed
is asking for compromise.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.840
And this is what
we have to realize

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.173
in the experimental realization.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.730
OK, there is one addition we
have to make to the model.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.730
And this is the following.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.000
We have to introduce
losses, losses

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.090
which do not come
from evaporation.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.620
It can be losses due to
background gas collisions,

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.450
or losses due to
inelastic collisions.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:16.955
So let me just show you
how I introduce that.

00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:19.410
I mean, I told you
that everything

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.750
is the logarithmic derivative.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.310
The logarithmic
change of any quantity

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.310
goes with the logarithmic
change in the atom

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.750
number times the coefficient.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.360
And for reasons which
become clear in a moment,

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.330
I'm now not looking at the
temperature, or the density,

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:39.410
or the phase space density.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.050
I'm really interested
in the collision rate,

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:43.920
because the collisions
rate is what

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.550
drives evaporative cooling.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.390
As long as we have collisions,
the cooling can go on.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.860
So I want to focus now on
how does the collision rate

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.520
change during evaporation.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.110
And during evaporation,
what we are changing

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.070
is the number of atoms,
because we evaporated.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:07.170
So by just putting everything
we have said together,

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.350
I have this expression.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.540
I assume that the
number of atoms

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:18.670
changes as a function of
time with the rate at which

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.890
high energy atoms are produced.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.940
The time constant for
this was lambda, the ratio

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.640
between the evaporation time
and the elastic collision time

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.730
times the elastic
collision time.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:34.340
So this is just re-writing
what we have discussed so far.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.830
But now I introduce that
there is another loss

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.260
rate due to inelastic collision,
technical problems and such,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.860
which has a time
constant of tau loss.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.090
And if I now do introduce
the famous ratio

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.880
of good to bad collisions,
good collisions

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.330
are elastic collisions
which drive evaporation.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.760
Bad collisions are collisions
where atoms are just

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.880
lost due to technical reasons
and inelastic collisions.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.430
So if I define this ratio
of good to bad collisions,

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:25.400
I have now this equation
here which tells me

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:32.030
how the collision rate
changes with time.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:36.200
Just wondering, is a
dT missing here or not?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:36.990
Yes.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.100
So there should be a dT.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.000
So this tells me
how the relative

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.160
or how the collision
rate changes

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.250
with the function of time.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:51.519
But now remember,
since this is not

00:47:51.519 --> 00:47:53.060
the derivative of
the collision rate,

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.560
it's the derivative
of the collision

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.768
rate over the collision rate.

00:47:55.768 --> 00:47:57.380
It's a logarithmic derivative.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.430
What we are talking here
about it, please add dT to it,

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:05.140
we're talking about is the
collision rate exponentially

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.520
growing when this
coefficient is positive.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.530
Or is it exponentially
decaying when this coefficient

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.170
is negative?

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:17.880
So you realize that we
obtain a threshold condition

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.400
when this coefficient is
larger or smaller than zero.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.610
And this is called the threshold
for runaway evaporation.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:30.060
So let me just summarize
the physics of power loss.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.760
The physics of exponential
increase and decrease

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:39.910
actually means that the
experimental situation is often

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:41.600
talking about a threshold.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.700
If you're above threshold and
you get evaporative cooling

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.020
going, you have a
positive exponent.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.910
And it will go faster,
and faster, and faster.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.240
If this exponent
is negative, you

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.640
have slowed down evaporation,
you can evaporate a little bit.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.950
But it will pretty much
come to a stand still.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:03.860
So this is why quite often,
the experimental realization

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:08.150
of evaporative cooling
requires to put enough atoms

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.570
from the laser cooling stage
at sufficiently low temperature

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:15.060
into a magnetic trap that
you fulfill the threshold

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.890
condition for
runaway evaporation.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.410
Any questions about that?

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.080
So in other words,
what we have found out,

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.100
we have found here an
expression for the threshold

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.630
of runaway evaporation.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:37.150
And it tells us that
we need a minimum ratio

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:38.890
of good to bad collisions.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.590
We may need 100
elastic collision

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.100
until we have one
inelastic collision.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.570
And then our ratio is 100.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.530
And we will see in a minute
if this ratio is 100,

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.352
if then we can make right
hand side in such a way

00:49:54.352 --> 00:49:55.560
that we run away evaporation.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:05.480
OK, so the left hand side is the
ratio of good to bad collisions

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.280
is maybe determined
how good our vacuum is.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.280
What determines the
right hand side?

00:50:15.169 --> 00:50:16.210
Well, we talked about it.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.350
Delta is our trapping
potential, linear or quadratic.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:24.390
Alpha and lambda depend
on the threshold eta.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:28.380
How aggressive are we in
setting a threshold in energy

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.710
for the evaporating atoms?

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:34.080
And what I'm showing you
here is the condition.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.460
I'm varying the threshold eta.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:46.471
And now I'm figuring out what is
the-- if I vary the ratio eta,

00:50:46.471 --> 00:50:49.830
I call this expression R min.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:52.000
And my ratio of good
to bad collision

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.150
has to be better than that.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:51:04.270
So if you just look at the
solid curve for parabolic trap,

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.400
this shows you that you
have to pick your parameter

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.610
eta between five and seven.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.590
If you pick eta too fast,
evaporation is too slow.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:18.040
And you need a much better
ratio of good to bad collisions.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.010
In other words, you need a
better vacuum, for instance.

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:24.370
But if you put eta
too low, you're

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:25.930
not cooling enough,
because you're

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.555
cutting too deep into
the distribution.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.960
You also realize that if
you take a linear power

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.740
law, like a quadrupole trap,
you get the dashed line.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.120
And the dashed line
has a much lower ratio,

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.490
has a much lower value of R min.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:48.470
In other words, if your
vacuum is not good enough

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.110
and you have losses,
in a linear trap,

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:54.190
you can still overcome
it by picking your eta

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:57.080
in this regime, whereas
for a parabolic trap,

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.090
you need at least
two or three times

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.880
better vacuum to get
into the runaway regime.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.030
Anyway, this is how you
can look at those equations

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:16.290
and figure out what is needed
to get into evaporative cooling.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:16.790
Collin.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.730
AUDIENCE: Do you need to be in
the runway regime to get PEC?

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.380
PROFESSOR: Not necessarily.

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.670
Some early
experiments have done,

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:27.970
I think, the first
experiment of Eric Cornell,

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.050
I think they never
saw this speed up.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.760
They had sort of
constant evaporation.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.800
Maybe the cooling rate was
even slightly going down.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.940
So you don't necessarily
need the exponential speedup.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.860
But you have to be in a
regime where at least,

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.550
if you're not
gaining speed, you're

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.940
not losing too much speed.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:56.760
But, yeah.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.384
I mean, you can just
take the equations

00:52:58.384 --> 00:53:04.870
and analyze them and
figure out if you're

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:05.990
in a favorable regime.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.220
And ultimately, it's fairly easy
to integrate those equations

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.920
as a function of time and have
completely realistic models.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:17.030
But what I presented to you
here is a simple analytic model.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.720
And I used the criterion
for runaway evaporation

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.371
to discuss how do you have to
pick your truncation parameter,

00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:26.870
and what happens if you have a
different trapping potential.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:37.330
So based on those
models, you will find out

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:44.530
that if you truncated
an eta parameter of six,

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.100
every truncation of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.660
means about 1% loss
in the atom number.

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:58.570
And after 600 collisions, after
600 elastic collision times,

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.620
you have lowered the
atom number by 100.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.970
But your phase space
density has increased

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.800
by six orders of magnitude.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.190
And that means if you have
two orders of magnitude

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:13.830
in the number and get six orders
of magnitude in the phase space

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.620
density, then your gamma
factor, which I haven't really

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.990
defined it here,
but it's the factor

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:23.580
which tells you how the
phase space density increase.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.720
Every order of
magnitude in the number

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.330
boosts the phase space density
by three orders of magnitude.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:31.280
And that's regarded
as very favorable.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.150
So in other words, we've talked
a lot about laser cooling.

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:38.730
In laser cooling, the standard
laser cooling schemes,

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.150
you're typically six
orders of magnitude away

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.540
form quantum degeneracy.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.200
And this tells you how
evaporative cooling

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.470
can get you there.

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:52.050
You should expect to lose
approximately a number of 100

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:55.210
in the number of atoms.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:56.760
And that's what
it takes you to go

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.910
from laser cooling to
quantum degeneracy.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.180
And you can estimate
what your time

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.840
is by asking what is the
elastic collision rate

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.750
right after laser cooling.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:14.920
If your elastic collision
rate is two seconds,

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.250
and you take 600
collisions to get to PEC,

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:21.400
you know that it would
take you 20 minutes.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.430
And you better work on a vacuum
which has 20 minutes lifetime.

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.920
Or alternatively, you
improve your laser cooling.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.220
Or you do some
adiabatic compression

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.430
in your magnetic
trap to make sure

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:35.340
that your elastic
collision time is faster,

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.830
that you can afford 600
collisions within the lifetime

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.160
given by other parameters.

00:55:47.482 --> 00:55:48.065
Any questions?

00:55:54.610 --> 00:56:01.570
OK, so evaporative cooling
happens in the everyday world.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:05.770
If you have water and
you blow at the water,

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:07.310
the water evaporates.

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:11.110
And by evaporation,
the water gets colder.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.890
So the water gets colder.

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.340
And it has, of
course, this process

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.390
has a lot of common to the
evaporative cooling of atoms

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:19.830
in an atom trap.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:24.600
But I want to ask you
now why is evaporative

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.620
cooling more
dramatic with atoms?

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.010
We can get the
atoms really cold.

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:32.370
But I don't think you've ever
seen that you can blow at water

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:34.070
and the water freezes.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:36.200
So what is the difference?

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:41.360
What is different in
evaporation how you encounter it

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.850
in every day life,
and evaporation

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:50.500
in the way how I just described
it, how we apply it to atoms?

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.460
AUDIENCE: Your control of eta.

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.400
Well, in atoms we can
really control eta.

00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:01.290
But by blowing on it, it's
just one level we evaporate.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:02.780
PROFESSOR: That's very close.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.060
We can pick our eta.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.905
But even more so,
what is constant?

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.300
Or what is the parameter which
describes evaporation in water?

00:57:18.483 --> 00:57:19.566
AUDIENCE: Surface tension.

00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:20.040
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:20.990
AUDIENCE: The surface tension?

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.323
PROFESSOR: Some surface tension.

00:57:22.323 --> 00:57:25.790
But the surface tension always
turns into a work function.

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:30.520
It tells us if we have water,
what is the energy, the work

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.400
function, for a water
molecule to escape?

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.160
And this work function,
it's an energy,

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.320
would correspond to eta kt.

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.390
If the water evaporates,
well, the work function

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.480
stays the same sort.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.450
It's sort of electron, whatever
fraction of an electron volt

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:48.480
or whatever it is.

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.510
But the temperature gets lower.

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:53.440
And therefore, the number
of molecules which,

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.220
water molecules,
which can evaporate,

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.170
becomes exponentially smaller.

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:01.390
I mean, I've sort of lured you
into thinking that keeping eta

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.980
constant is the most
natural thing in the world.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.030
Yes, it's the most
natural world for us

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:09.160
who want to-- efficient
evaporation of atoms.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.050
But for normal substances,
it's the work function

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.410
which is constant.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:15.900
So therefore, as
the system cools,

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.830
your eta becomes
larger and larger.

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.710
And everything turns
into a standstill.

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:26.100
So we are actively tuning the
work function of our system

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.295
to sustain a high
rate of evaporation.

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.070
How do we define eta?

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:45.920
How do we select the energy
threshold for evaporation?

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:50.750
Well, for many, many years,
Bose-Einstein condensation

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.660
was mainly done
in magnetic traps.

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.070
And there were two methods.

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:56.460
One is just lower
the magnetic fields.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:59.000
But lowering the magnetic
fields is pretty bad,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.540
because it weakens
the magnetic trap.

00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.280
And if you weaken the trap,
you lower the density.

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.000
And therefore, just because
of that, the elastic collision

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.780
rate slows down.

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:15.380
So what turned out to be
by far the superior choice

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:20.020
is to remove atoms with
our F induced evaporation.

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:23.620
So if you have a magnetic
trap, you can tune in our F

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:28.330
spin flip transition
to a certain frequency.

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:30.570
But the frequency depends
on magnetic field.

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:33.010
The magnetic field in a
trap depends on position.

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.850
So what you're doing is,
you're selecting with your RF

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:38.900
frequency a certain
point in space

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.700
where the atoms
can leave the trap

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.600
and are transferred by a
spin flip RF transition

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:52.580
to an anti-trap state, and are
then rejected from the trap.

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.150
I mean, this is very flexible.

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:57.380
You can change the depths
of your magnetic trap

00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.880
by just using an RF synthesizer.

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.400
And you can change
the trap depths.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.722
You can lower the trap
depths without weakening

01:00:04.722 --> 01:00:05.805
the confinement potential.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.330
I don't have time
to go into details,

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:14.060
but what I'm showing
here is that there

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:18.784
is two regimes when you
have this magnetic trap.

01:00:18.784 --> 01:00:20.200
Red is spin up,
blue is spin down.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.180
And this is your RF transition.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:27.380
There is a regime where
you have strong RF,

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:30.010
you should now use
dressed energy levels.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:33.360
We've discussed dressed energy
levels in the optical domain.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.620
These are now dressed energy
levels in the RF domain.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.300
And there's a wonderful
chapter about it

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.200
in atom photon interaction.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.600
So it really means
in the dressed energy

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.020
levels become
something like this.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:50.810
So you have a potential which
looks like an inverted W.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:53.350
And you really realize
this potential.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:59.420
But when the RF is weak, you
have a certain probability

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.030
when the atoms go back and forth
through the transition region

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.800
that sometimes they will
fall down to the lower state.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.380
And this looks more like this.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.120
The diabatic picture
looks more like

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.190
that you have a little leak
and atoms are trickling down

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:15.720
to the non-confining state.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.070
Anyway, there are two regimes.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.020
And the experiment is
usually somewhere in between.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.380
It is not necessary to go
to the fully adiabatic.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.210
It doesn't pay off to go to
the fully adiabatic limit.

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:31.200
So this is how RF
evaporation is implemented.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.630
But I should say in these
days, a lot of evaporation

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.380
is now done in optical traps.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.910
And in optical traps,
the method of choice

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:45.140
is you just ramp down the
optical trapping potential.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.660
Now, when you ramp down the
optical trapping potential,

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.220
addressing Collin's
question, you usually

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.770
do not go into the
runaway regime.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:55.900
Because I haven't included
that my model assumed

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.810
we have a constant trap.

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:01.410
But if you now add to the
model that you are continuously

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:04.960
opening up, weakening
the trap, you

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.870
have another effect
which makes the exponent

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.836
for runaway evaporation
more and more negative.

01:02:10.836 --> 01:02:12.210
And I think
ultimately, you don't

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.530
get any runaway
evaporation anymore.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.960
On the other hand, optical
traps are often more tightly

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.840
confining than magnetic traps.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.430
And you have sufficiently
high density to begin with.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:27.240
So therefore, you can tolerate
a slow down of evaporation

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.692
and still reach the destination.

01:02:30.692 --> 01:02:32.400
But anyway, I'm now
getting more and more

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.210
into technical aspects.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.750
I think I've given
you the concepts.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.160
But let me just flash
you one picture.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.060
This of course, assumes
an idealized model

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:45.130
where we have only two
levels, spin up and spin down.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:48.590
You all know that atoms
have hyperfine structure.

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:51.690
Sodium or barium has n equals 2.

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.250
And if you draw now
the stress levels

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:57.350
for five hyperfine
levels in RF transition,

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.470
it looks fairly complicated.

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:01.970
But the result is
fairly beautiful.

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:06.140
When an atom in F equals
2 reaches this point,

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.290
and in the dressed atom picture,
the point of evaporation,

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:14.190
the point where the atom
is in resonance with the RF

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:18.370
is the point where this
potential bends down.

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:22.330
The atom is adiabatically
transferred in a dressed state

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:27.460
from MF plus 2 to MF minus 2.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.420
So when you evaporate
at this point,

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.500
without maybe you
noticing it, you actually

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.280
do a four photon transition
in the dressed atom picture.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.330
Again, it's an
example where when

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.740
we teach about the
schemes, we can completely

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.670
neglect about
hyperfine structure.

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:46.340
And it's just wonderful to see
that the actual implementation

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.470
works as well for
complicated atoms

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:53.590
then it does for our
idealized two level atom.

01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:59.092
Final remark.

01:03:59.092 --> 01:04:01.175
What is the cooling limit
for evaporative cooling?

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.140
When we talked
about laser cooling,

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.440
I derived for you
the Doppler limit.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.400
And we talked about even
improved cooling limits

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.930
when we discussed sub-Doppler
and sub-recoil cooling.

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:21.240
So what is the cooling limit
for evaporative cooling?

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.400
Well, the answer is there
is no fundamental limit.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:33.290
There is no h bar or
quantized limit there.

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:37.950
There is a practical limit,
which usually depends

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:40.380
on residual heating, on
inelastic collisions,

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.420
and all that.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.690
But we have reached
an evaporative cooling

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:47.930
temperatures as low
as 400 picokelvin.

01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:51.090
And the limit was not set
by anything fundamental.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.940
It was more set by our patience.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.000
The lower the temperature, the
slower the process becomes.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.244
And also, by the sensitivity
to technical noise

01:05:01.244 --> 01:05:02.410
and technical perturbations.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.750
Of course, just a
final comment which

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.810
is a segue to what we
hopefully do on Friday.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:16.390
For evaporative
cooling, I've always

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:22.350
assumed that the energy
in the trap is continuous.

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:26.020
In other words, if you have an
harmonic oscillator trapping

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:30.120
potential, I've neglected
the discrete level structure.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.730
And this is an
excellent approximation,

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.340
because many, many atom traps
have dressed frequencies

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.390
of a few hertz or kilohertz.

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.595
And at very low
temperature, even

01:05:42.595 --> 01:05:46.480
at nanokelvin temperatures,
you populate many levels.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.720
When it comes to the discrete
nature of trapping levels,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.530
we should use a
quantum description

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:54.780
of the motion of
atoms in the trap.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.550
And this is the regime
of sideband cooling.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:00.470
Sideband cooling is
much more important

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:05.430
for ions, charged particles,
and for neutral atoms.

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:10.560
So therefore, we will discuss
sideband cooling on Friday

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.230
when we discuss ion traps.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.150
Any questions about
evaporative cooling?

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.638
AUDIENCE: So may be
technical, but once you

01:06:29.638 --> 01:06:31.368
get to the temperatures
of picokelvins,

01:06:31.368 --> 01:06:36.308
how do you maintain--
do you keep

01:06:36.308 --> 01:06:39.290
cooling to maintain
that temperature?

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:42.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, usually when
we reach very low temperature,

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.440
there is some form
of technical heating.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.490
And we've often seen
when we prepare cloud

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.570
at nanokelvin
temperature, we can only

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:54.320
keep it when we allow a little
bit of building evaporation.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.170
We've sometimes seen
that when we just

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:01.480
keep the atoms in an atom
trap, they just slowly heat up.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.140
But if you keep on evaporating
them at a very slow rate,

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.370
we can maintain low
temperatures for much longer.

01:07:16.844 --> 01:07:17.510
Other questions?

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:21.630
OK.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.290
So already pretty late.

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:30.870
We just have 10 or
15 minutes left.

01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:32.390
I was hoping that
I could already

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:35.780
start earlier today to
talk about Bose gasses.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:40.720
Today, I was hoping to talk
mainly about Bose gasses,

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.250
on Wednesday on Fermi gasses,
on Friday on ion traps.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.340
We are sort of half an
hour behind schedule,

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.530
and I have to figure out
how I make up for it.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:53.170
But let me just start
now with Bose gasses.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:55.880
I've taught about this
subject several times

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.100
at summer schools.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.860
And what I give you here is
a compressed version on it.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.190
I will not talk too much
about the ideal Bose

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:04.690
gas, because most
of you have seen

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:06.550
that in statistical mechanics.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.980
And I will also omit
superfluid hydrodynamics,

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:13.660
because well, it's
interesting, but it's

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.690
more special than
the other topics.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:18.670
So what I want to cover
here is to give you

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:21.510
the main ingredients
for the description

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:24.700
of weekly interacting
homogeneous and inhomogeneous

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.210
Bose gases.

01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.960
And then as a second
part, talk about

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.750
the superfluid
Mott-insulator transition.

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.740
But well, for those
of you who are not

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.560
working with ultra-cold Bose
gasses, maybe some of it

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.270
sounds like jargon to you.

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:43.899
But there is one sort of
overarching concept, which

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:47.359
I want to emphasize in the
theoretical description.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:51.609
And this is some form of
mean field approximation.

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:55.040
When we go through the
weakly interacting Bose gas,

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.560
then we go through
superfluid Fermi gasses,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.439
and we discuss the superfluid
Mott-insulator transition.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:06.816
One theme will be if you have
a product of four operators,

01:09:06.816 --> 01:09:09.149
and that's what you get when
you have interacting atoms,

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:10.710
you cannot solve anything.

01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:14.450
And you need a method to go from
the product of four operators

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.279
to the product of two operators.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:18.319
And then you solve a
quadratic equation.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.920
And the step to go
from four to two

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.819
is called a mean
field approximation.

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.750
And I want to show you
three kinds of mean field

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.990
approximation, for
the one you have often

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:32.100
seen for the weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.660
But then I want to show you
mean field approximation

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.240
for fermions, where it
is a pairing field which

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.490
is a mean field, not your
usual mean field energy.

01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:46.029
And then I want to talk
about before that even, I

01:09:46.029 --> 01:09:48.160
want to talk about the
superfluid Mott-insulator

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.510
transition, where we do a
very different mean field

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:51.819
approximation.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:53.390
So maybe you'll
realize a little bit

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:56.670
by repeating that scheme
how theory is done

01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:00.910
and how you can deal
with simple Hamiltonians,

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:02.960
but your can't solve
them because they

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.930
contain products
of four operators.

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:07.460
So there is sort
of a [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.300
through those three
chapters and sort

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.060
of showing you how you can
do interesting many body

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.370
physics by doing the
right approximation.

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:19.320
It also teaches you how
many body physics is done.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.660
You have an Hamiltonian
which you can't solve.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:25.540
And you have to guess the
solution and put half of it

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.730
in an approximation.

01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:28.800
And once you've done
the right approximation,

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.010
the rest becomes [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:33.390
So with that spirit,
I want to go with you

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:40.260
through the Bogoliubov
approximation

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.141
for weakly interacting Bose gas.

01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:45.640
I don't think I
have to say too much

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.120
about the ideal
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.040
because it's dealt in pretty
much all undergraduate

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.220
or graduate text books.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.370
There are just two
things to remember

01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:59.150
in terms of a
system description.

01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.590
First, whether
Bose-Einstein condensation

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:08.610
occurs or not depends on
the density of states.

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:11.710
And that depends on
dimension and confinement.

01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:13.940
So the fact that
you are in a trap,

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.666
it changes the
density of states.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:18.165
And it changes the criterion
for Bose-Einstein condensation.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.050
But then in terms of
a system description,

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:27.460
if you want to describe your
Bose gas and its properties,

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:32.420
there are aspects of
Bose-Einstein condensation

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.540
which are pretty close
to the ideal gas,

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.780
and others which require
many body physics.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.240
What is always close to the
ideal gas is the transition

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:45.220
temperature and the condensate
fraction, because what happens

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.480
is in almost all
experiments, when

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.950
you reach Bose-Einstein
condensation,

01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:55.310
your gas is to a good
approximation non-interacting.

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:58.490
Because kt, the
transition temperature,

01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:01.940
is much larger than the
interaction energy in the gas.

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.350
So before condensation, or
at the onset of condensation,

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:09.750
your gas is like an ideal gas.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:11.940
And you will only find a
few percent corrections

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.240
to the formula
for the ideal gas.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.644
So therefore, if you want
to know at what temperature

01:12:17.644 --> 01:12:19.060
do you reach the
transition point,

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.080
or if you're below
the transition point,

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.420
if you're 50% below the
transition temperature, what

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.850
is your condensate
fraction, you can simply

01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:28.900
look up the original
formula by Einstein.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.420
And it gives you a
reasonably accurate answer.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.690
However, for the condensed
gas, for the fraction

01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:40.990
of atoms which are
both condensed,

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.970
those are atoms in
one quantum state.

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:48.660
For them, there
is no other scale

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.310
than the energy
between the atoms.

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:55.220
So therefore, for
the uncondensed gas,

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.780
you can get away with an
ideal gas approximation.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.570
For the condensate
itself, we have

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:01.900
to put in the many body
physics of the interaction.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.790
Well, this slide shows
here shadow images

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.200
of expanding
Bose-Einstein condensates.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.820
We do evaporative cooling
in a magnetic trap.

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:22.100
You see the shadow picture
of the thermal cloud.

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.690
And you see the onset of
Bose-Einstein condensation

01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:30.190
as the sudden appearance of, it
looks like, a pit in a cherry.

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:39.580
There is a cool down more
confined distribution

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.570
of atoms in the Bose
condensed state.

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:47.860
I think it should play again.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:55.610
So this gas is
pretty much described

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:58.730
by an ideal gas
where you can put

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:02.240
in the g2 function, the
onset of quantum degeneracy.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.710
But it looks almost
like an ideal gas,

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:09.250
whereas in an ideal gas,
the Bose-Einstein condensate

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:12.700
should be in the lowest
energy state of the trap.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.290
And I will show you in the
next few minutes on Wednesday

01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:19.340
that we are far away from that.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:23.500
So interactions are negligible
for the normal component,

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:28.410
for the thermal cloud, but are
very important for the Bose

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:31.640
condensed gas.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.600
So when you take cross sections
through this cloud, or 2-D

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.270
pictures, you see how the
broad thermal distribution

01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:43.880
turns into a
Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.380
And if you look
at such a profile,

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.260
you can clearly see
the normal component.

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.460
The normal component can
be, with good accuracy,

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.500
be fitted by a
non-interacting model,

01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:00.820
whereas central peak is a
Bose-Einstein condensate, which

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.412
requires the description
I want to show you now.

01:15:05.412 --> 01:15:08.960
The condensate
fraction is shown here.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.870
And again, with
fairly good accuracy,

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:14.950
it follows the
description of Einstein,

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:17.320
because the condensate
fraction is not

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.120
a property of the condensate.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.670
1 minus the
condensate fraction is

01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:23.880
a property of the thermal gas.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.080
In the spirit of
Einstein, Einstein

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:32.650
calculated how many atoms can
be in the thermal component

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.380
at a given temperature.

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.790
So Einstein called
it the saturated gas.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:45.510
At a given temperature,
you can only

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:48.750
keep in thermal equilibrium
a certain number

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.440
of atoms in your gas.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.140
If you have more atoms, they
condense into the ground state.

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.400
This is sort of the
statistical description.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.980
So therefore, what
I'm plotting here

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:02.810
is the condensate
fraction is actually

01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:04.580
a property of the normal gas.

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.850
It shows that the
normal gas is saturated,

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:10.430
can only hold a certain
number of atoms,

01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:12.660
and the remainder of
the number of atoms

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.863
has to be in the condensate.

01:16:14.863 --> 01:16:16.904
AUDIENCE: I thought in
the three dimensional gas,

01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:19.716
it was three halves.

01:16:19.716 --> 01:16:21.590
PROFESSOR: Yes, but this
is an harmonic trap.

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:23.756
And the harmonic trap changes
the density of states.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.040
Let's talk about the homogeneous
Bose-Einstein condensate

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:33.985
and weak interactions.

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:45.440
If you write down
the Hamiltonian

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.030
for the interactions, it
will appear many, many times.

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:55.190
The general way to
write down interactions

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:58.930
between two particles is
you annihilate particles

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:01.620
in momentum k and p.

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:06.000
And then, they reappear
at different momenta.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.790
So one momentum
gets upshifted by q.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.350
And one momentum gets
downshifted by q.

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:13.830
This guarantees
momentum conservation.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:16.330
So what I'm showing you here
is the elementary process

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:20.270
of scattering two particles
with momentum k and p scatter,

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:21.360
disappear.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.510
That's why we have the
annihilation operator.

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:25.930
And then they reappear
to a new momenta.

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:29.850
That's the most general form
of a binary interaction.

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:32.170
And now we have to
make approximations.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:34.030
Nobody can solve
this Hamiltonian

01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:35.320
in the most general way.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.980
So one approximation we
make is that since the range

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:43.390
of the atomic interactions is
much smaller than the distance

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:46.260
between atoms or the thermal
[INAUDIBLE] wavelengths,

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:50.390
we approximate the potential
by a short range potential,

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.180
or delta function.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:57.010
Well, the Fourier of a
delta function is constant.

01:17:57.010 --> 01:18:00.460
And that would mean in
momentum space, this momentum

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:04.750
dependent matrix
element squared-- yeah,

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:08.010
matrix element--
is just constant.

01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:13.120
So therefore, we can
approximate the Hamiltonian

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.920
by a constant
interaction parameter.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.150
And then we have the sum over
all these creation annihilation

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:20.650
operators.

01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:24.020
I don't want to go into details
of low energy scattering

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.600
physics, but it is most
convenient to describe

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.110
this parameter by u knot,
which is the Fourier

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:34.650
transform of the
interaction potential.

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:38.770
Or very often we parametrize
it with the s wave scattering

01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.410
lengths, which is the
only relevant parameter

01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:44.890
for elastic collisions
at low temperature.

01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:46.950
So with that, we have
now a Hamiltonian

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.150
which has kinetic energy.

01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:54.700
And here is the potential
energy due to the interaction

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.400
between the atoms.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.330
And we have taken this constant
Fourier transform u knot out

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:02.230
of the summation.

01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:05.700
Now, I mentioned already to
you that a product of four

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:06.970
operators cannot be solved.

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:09.010
You need an
approximation where you

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:13.540
reduce the number of
operators from four to two.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.510
And then you solve a
quadratic equation.

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:17.830
And the solution is
Bogoliubov solution.

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:20.720
So how do we reduce
now this product

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.060
of four operators to two?

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.310
Well, when we have a condensate
where many, many, atoms are

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:30.040
in one quantum state, we
can make the Bogoliubov

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.080
approximation.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.750
The Bogoliubov
approximation is, well,

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:37.380
if the creation annihilation
operator in the zero momentum

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:43.090
state for the condensate has
the following matrix element.

01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:45.870
And now you can see,
if N knot, the number

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:48.460
of atoms in the
condensate is large,

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:54.980
well, we can neglect the
difference between N knot,

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.620
N knot plus 1, and
N knot minus 1.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.270
And we simply make
the approximation

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.020
that the operator a
knot and a knot dagger

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.150
is replaced by the
square root of N knot.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:09.890
And then, in this sum of
[? our quartic ?] terms,

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:21.550
we only keep those terms which
have at least two occurrences

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:25.460
of the index zero,
because the terms which

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:29.400
are for instance new
occurrence of the index zero

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.450
don't get this
multiplier N knot.

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:35.130
So we sort of do an expansion
in powers of N knot,

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:38.580
and we stop here.

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:43.380
So therefore, now if we make
sure that any combination

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:48.540
of those two involves the index
zero, we factor out N knot.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.590
And then we have products
of k minus k with dagger,

01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:54.860
dagger k minus k
annihilation operator, or we

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:59.340
have mixed term a dagger k, a of
k, a minus k dagger, a minus k.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:02.300
But this is what we get.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.290
The next step is
purely technical.

01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:08.420
We want to get rid of N
knot and replace it by N.

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.200
So N is N knot plus the
sum of the population

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.365
or other momentum states.

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:19.260
And that's now our Hamiltonian,
which still looks complicated.

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.890
But it can immediately be
solved, because all it involves

01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:25.880
is a quadratic
product of operators.

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.760
Let me finish this derivation.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.210
It takes four to five minutes.

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:34.470
I don't think people
come in on Mondays.

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:36.700
They always come in
after us on Wednesday.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.510
Is that correct?

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:40.700
So let me just continue.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.600
I would like to reach the final
result with the Bogoliubov

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.770
transformation.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.030
So what I want to show you
is that the moment you have

01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:50.760
bilinear operators, all you
have to do is in essence

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.910
you have to solve a
quadratic equation.

01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:58.050
And because with all the
indices and constant,

01:21:58.050 --> 01:21:59.970
it looks a little
bit complicated.

01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:04.320
But so let me just say that the
structure of this Hamiltonian

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:10.850
involves sums which are a of k
and a of minus k. k minus k is

01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:12.750
of course important,
because that's

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.800
important for
momentum conservation.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:20.420
So let me now call a of
k a, and a of minus k b.

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:27.654
Then this Hamiltonian has
the following structure.

01:22:27.654 --> 01:22:31.470
It has terms a dagger a,
b dagger b, b dagger b.

01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:35.100
But then it has other terms
a dagger b dagger plus ba.

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.590
Now, let me put it this way.

01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:39.790
If that wouldn't exist,
we would be done.

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:43.530
Because an Hamiltonian
which has e knot a dagger

01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:46.280
a is an harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.060
It is diagonalized.

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:51.640
a and a dagger are
just eigenoperators,

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.900
which create quasi-particles
with energy e knot.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:59.420
So if you could eliminate
this term, we would be done.

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:03.240
So therefore, let's
follow Bogoliubov

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.440
and say that we introduce
new operators, alpha beta.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:12.270
And the alpha beta operators are
linear combinations of a and b.

01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:15.360
Or vice versa, a and b
are linear combinations

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.320
of the new operators,
alpha beta.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.350
And since we have
a bosonic system,

01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:24.570
and we think it's a good idea
to keep the system bosonic,

01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:27.790
we require that
those new operators

01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:31.060
fulfill bosonic
commutation relations.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.360
Those bosonic
commutation relations

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:38.880
are fulfilled if u square
minus v square, u and v

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.770
are the linear coefficient
which express ab

01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:44.850
in terms of alpha and
beta if that is 1.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:49.050
So in other words, u and v
are now two new parameters.

01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:53.310
One condition for
u and v is used up

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:57.190
to ensure the bosonic
character of alpha and beta.

01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:59.640
But now, we have a
second condition.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.470
We can have two conditions
for two parameters.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:06.740
So what we do is we just
rewrite this Hamiltonian

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.410
in terms of alpha beta.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.730
And that's what we get.

01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:12.770
It's a bilinear Hamiltonian
where the linear transformation

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:14.610
stays bilinear.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:19.310
But now, our second condition
which we can impose on u and v

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:23.940
is that the prefactor of
this cross product is zero.

01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.400
So then, by using
those two conditions

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.280
for u and v-- and you find the
equations in many textbooks.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.580
I'm not discussing them
in great detail here.

01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:35.970
We have obtained an
Hamiltonian of this kind.

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:38.140
And this is diagonalized.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.930
We know now that alpha
beta create quasi-particles

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:42.920
at a certain energy.

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:50.370
So now, by going back,
I'm in alpha beta

01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:52.570
where expressed by a and b.

01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:56.360
A was a of k. b
was a of minus k.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.220
I just go back to the
original nomenclature.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.450
But we have diagonalized
the Hamiltonian.

01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:04.160
So what we have achieved
now is our Hamiltonian

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.380
is written in this
following way.

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:12.250
Actually, I've recycled
a now. a is no longer

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.910
a particle in a
given momentum state.

01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:15.850
It's now a quasi-particle.

01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:18.200
So we have now diagonalized
the Hamiltonian

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.440
for the weakly
interacting Bose gas.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.780
And what we have
obtained is, well, we

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.840
have the full solution.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.585
Everything you want to know
about this system we know.

01:25:26.585 --> 01:25:28.850
And in particular,
we know what are

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:31.580
the characteristic excitation
energies for quasi-particle.

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.360
And this quasi-particle
energy gives us

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.200
the energy as a
function of momentum

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.150
by replacing the
parameter u knot by c.

01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:51.320
c is the speed of sound.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.390
I can be rewrite it like this.

01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:56.430
And you see that it
makes sense immediately,

01:25:56.430 --> 01:26:00.060
because we have now a
dispersion relation, which

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:05.240
in the limit of high momenta is
just the normal kinetic energy.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.950
So the quasi-particle
are free particles,

01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:11.990
whereas at low momentum,
when this term dominates,

01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:14.820
the dispersion
relation is linear.

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:18.750
And linear means
sound and phonons.

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:22.590
Bose-Einstein condensation
is a low energy phenomena.

01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:27.220
So you should not expect that
you change any characteristics

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.210
of high energy quasi-particles.

01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:31.870
If you wreck a particle in
the Bose-Einstein condensate

01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:36.220
with high energy, it flies
out at a high energy particle.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.970
But a low energy excitation
creates sound waves.

01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:43.182
So this is what
we have found now.

01:26:43.182 --> 01:26:47.730
And I will show you on
Wednesday how it is observed.

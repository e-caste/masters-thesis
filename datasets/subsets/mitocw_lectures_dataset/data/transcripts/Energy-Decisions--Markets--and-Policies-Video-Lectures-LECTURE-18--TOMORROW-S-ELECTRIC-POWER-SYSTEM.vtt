RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
What I want to do today

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.280
is look ahead and
talk a little bit

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.390
about where the grid's going.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.940
This is going to
be based largely

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.770
on that future of the electric
grid study that a bunch of us

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.760
did.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.680
You'll see in the Joskow
paper a fair amount of overlap

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.830
and an awful lot of agreement,
although his emphasis is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.250
a bit different.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.370
So let me start with what
the system looks like now.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.380
That's a picture of line
losses in transmission

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.580
and distribution.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.160
That's heat,
basically waste heat.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.450
And that's gone down
sharply over time.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.400
It floats around 6-7%.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940
These appear to be
in line with line

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.180
losses in other
developed countries,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.570
if you make allowance
for density.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.310
They're higher in
Canada and Australia.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.440
They're lower in
Germany and France

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.570
because it's more
compact countries.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.440
But you can put us all
more or less on a line.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.090
Reliability is a little tougher.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.070
You might ask the
question, is the US system

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.050
more or less reliable
than systems elsewhere?

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.070
And the answer is we
don't know because data

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.100
on reliability and other
aspects of performance

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.440
are terrible in the US.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.070
You might ask why that is?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.130
I'll suggest an answer.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.710
And it has to do with the
structure of regulation.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.580
If I measure-- if I use
a standard definition

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.590
of an outage, and I measure how
often my customers don't have

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.270
power, how many
outages, how long

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.570
they last, and you do the same,
and I'm above you in outages,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.760
people yell at me.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.960
If nobody knows,
nobody yells at me.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.880
These things are just
not measured in the US.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.220
I mean, they're
measured in some states.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.160
They're not reported in some
states where they're measured.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.310
And different definitions are
used all over the country.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.940
There is now a standard
IEEE definition for outages.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.980
And it's spreading slowly.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.470
But even then, it's not
reported in lots of places.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.460
So we cannot tell if the system
is more or less reliable than

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.460
it was in 1930,
which is bizarre.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.290
But there's more.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.600
So I'm going to talk about
most of the terrain we covered

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.380
in the future of the grid.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.150
We focused on 2030 because
of the speed at which things

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.080
change, the grid in
2030 will be dominated

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.810
by technologies we know today.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.850
Not necessarily
technologies in widespread

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.610
use, but stuff we know.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.220
Stuff we don't know,
that's invented tomorrow,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.920
is unlikely to
penetrate by then.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.430
So we said, what are the big
challenges and opportunities?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.810
And these are the
ones we focused on.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.120
There are a bunch
of new technologies.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.160
Will they get developed
and used properly?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.380
There will be more
large-scale wind and solar.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.530
We'll talk about the
issues that raises.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.080
There'll be more
electric vehicles.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.330
How many more, nobody knows.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.860
But more, and in some
places a fair amount.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.860
There'll be more distributed
generation, rooftop solar,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.250
on various kinds of roofs,
and some distributed wind.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.600
And the system will be more
reliant on communications

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.730
and computation,
which means there'll

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.000
be more of an issue
of cybersecurity

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.850
and an issue of
information privacy.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.418
People will know every 15
minutes how much electricity

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:13.960
you're using.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.230
And you might not want
everybody to know that.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.950
So to remind you of
some of the constraints,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.590
I talked last time--

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.250
last Wednesday-- about
the state/federal divide.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.490
States are important.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.110
There's not much evidence--
not much appetite after

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.945
the California debacle and
after the Lehman crisis--

00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:46.880
the whole crisis-- not
much appetite for reform.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.290
Very diverse system--
municipal utilities, co-ops,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.380
big utilities, little
utilities; vertically

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.810
integrated in some
places, federally owned

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.970
in other places.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.320
There's not much
growth expected.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.990
7/10 of a percentage
point a year

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.630
is the standard case
forecast out to 2035.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.430
And very durable assets.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.200
This is actually a number.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.160
I had it last year.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.770
The forecast number has
doubled since last year,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.090
but it's still low.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.250
Anybody care to guess
what fraction of 2000--

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.480
what fraction of--

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.360
let's say 2010 capacity
will be retired by 2035?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.860
AUDIENCE: 1%.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.970
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, now you're reaching.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.470
No.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.880
It's higher than that.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.660
It's higher.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.580
It's almost 7%.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.810
Last year, it was 3.5%.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.625
Last year, the
estimate was 3.5%.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.310
The difference is mainly
environmental retirements

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.710
and really cheap gas.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.560
So the notion is, because of
really cheap gas and tighter

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.700
environmental policy, 7% of
capacity will be retired.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.830
That's not a lot of
turnover in 25 years.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.670
That's not a lot of turnover.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.570
So the generating fleet is going
to look a lot like it does now,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.800
a lot like it does now.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.700
Andrew?

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.640
AUDIENCE: This is for a base
case assumption, like the--

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.723
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:15.098
AUDIENCE: So it
has no assumption

00:06:15.098 --> 00:06:17.650
about environmental regulations
or something like that?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.650
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.950
This is EIA, the Energy
Information Administration.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.060
And their base case assumes
no change in current policy.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.380
So one of the things
that it used to assume--

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.940
in fact, it does assume--

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.540
it assumes that current
renewable subsidies,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.670
which have--

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.540
you don't-- laws don't
have infinite lifetimes.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.640
The law expires at some point.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.740
It assumes that expires.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.100
So it'll be a little
light on renewables.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.880
They'll run some other
cases-- they're not out yet--

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.710
assuming more
renewables, assuming

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.240
higher prices and lower prices.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.910
But that's the base case.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.950
OK, so not much turnover.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.040
the argument is--
that we have made--

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.120
is that the grid does have these
challenges and opportunities,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.440
the turnover is slow.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.530
If you want to get
anything done in 2035,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.140
you've got to start now.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.050
A little bit about
the smart grid.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.360
And it's not a term
I like because it

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.480
means different things
to different people.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.270
And here are four examples.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.240
This is the National Institute
of Standards and Technologies'

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.580
favorite diagram because--

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.430
and it stresses that
the grid in the future

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.250
will have this flow
of power, of course--

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.160
but lots of flows of data.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.200
And why do they
stress that view?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.170
Because they're doing
this interface standards.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.480
They're doing standard setting
for all of those flows.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.780
That's a big deal.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.720
This is EPRI over here,
the Electric Power Research

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.100
Institute.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.580
EPRI's view of the smart grid
has to do with things that go--

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.800
that happen around the user.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.320
So there's some focus--

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.170
some automation of the
distribution system,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.330
and plug-in hybrids, and smart
refrigerators, and rooftop

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.900
solar.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.070
They focus on your house.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.890
This is somebody in nature.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.340
And in nature, they
focus on microgrids.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.010
Or in this picture, they
focus on microgrids, which we

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.260
can talk about if you want to.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.360
But it's not something
that we think

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.078
is going to be a big deal.

00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:28.870
And this is the Department
of Energy, which

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.730
has it all, which has it all.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.500
So as the title says, I guess--

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.318
my view is that "smart"
is a means, not an end.

00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:41.860
You don't care how
smart the grid is.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.440
What you care is,
what's its performance

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.970
and what's its cost?

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.020
It will get smarter.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.150
But that's not the objective.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.620
That's the means.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.170
So I went through some of the
challenges and constraints.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.670
We focused on a bunch
of policy areas.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.520
So let me talk first
about technology.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.290
Here I immediately
get out of my depth,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.010
but I will do what I can.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.670
There's really a lot
of interesting stuff.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.620
I'm going to talk about
phasor measurement

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.520
units in a few minutes.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.210
Flexible AC
transmission systems let

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.840
you vary the
characteristics of lines

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.710
so that you can to some
extent control flows.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.440
I told you last time that
electric power networks are not

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.810
really like sort of old-style
telephone systems or water

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.350
systems.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.420
You don't do valves.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.310
You can sort of do valves.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.450
New sensor technologies lets
you know the state of the lines.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.720
So that on a hot day, you put
less electricity through them

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.370
because you can see
they're sagging.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.700
And there are a bunch of-- well,
dynamic line rating systems

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.840
deal with automating the
readings from these sensors.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.320
Energy storage, I'll
talk about, and a bunch

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.070
of other technologies.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.730
Farther on down, toward the
customers, the low voltage

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.650
stuff, there's a
lot of automation

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.900
at the substation
that's possible,

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:20.270
quicker detection of outages,
optimization of-- the Volt/VAR

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.330
optimization
controls-- enables you

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.450
to control voltage levels,
particularly on long lines,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.630
more accurately.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.910
Conservation voltage
reduction lets

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.630
you reduce voltage on the
whole system just a little bit,

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.033
to save a lot of energy.

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:38.450
There are places
where the voltage

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.750
is above the requirement because
you can't properly control it.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.630
So it ends-- and you
have to keep it above--

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.480
you have to keep it within
a certain bound everywhere.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.080
If you can control better,
you can reduce it everywhere.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.880
Automated fault detection
is really quite interesting.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.000
The interesting part is
automatic restoration.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.230
Advanced metering systems
are very important.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.940
And I will talk about those.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.570
And, of course, this
all comes together

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.000
where you control the grid.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.600
And I'm going to talk
about particularly using

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.910
these meters in a little
while, and right now making

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.110
the control center work.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.995
So here's-- if it
works, if it works--

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.780
my favorite movie.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:31.960
All right.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.550
I've played this a million
times in a million places.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.370
And it's never been this bad.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.870
Let me tell you what you would
have seen if this had worked.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.620
What you would--
this is the result

00:11:54.620 --> 00:12:00.950
of an outage in southern
Florida in 2008.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.150
And what you're seeing-- those
red dots are phasor measurement

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.620
units that describe--

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.740
that pick up the state
of the system in terms

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:16.750
of frequency and phase angle of
voltage and current, many times

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.180
a second, time stamped.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.550
So that, in principle,
they give a picture

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.040
of the state of the
whole system instant

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.620
by instant, which
we do not now have.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.100
The red dots are where
the measurements are made.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.770
The spaghetti chart on
the left is the readings

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.000
from individual ones.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.550
And the folks at Virginia Tech,
who invented the measuring

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:42.610
systems, have basically
interpolated and extrapolated

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.607
to put together a picture
of the whole system.

00:12:46.607 --> 00:12:48.440
What's interesting
here-- there are a couple

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.890
of things interesting here.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:56.080
First of all-- and I won't hurt
your eyes by playing it again--

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.480
what's interesting here is,
one, the geographic extent.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.000
So if something
happens in Florida--

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.040
and the frequency
distortion most durably

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.670
is in northern
Minnesota or Canada.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.140
You may be able to see that.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.500
The second is, it happens fast.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.890
This is 25 seconds.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.260
So here's where it goes out.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.460
Boom.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.320
It is happening--
there are things

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.960
all around the country,
all around the Eastern

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.600
Interconnect, and most durably
up there in northern Minnesota.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.280
So it's fast.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.070
There's a lot of data.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.760
You couldn't react
to it as a human.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.734
Yeah?

00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.970
AUDIENCE: Does the setting move?

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.754
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
let me see if I can freeze it.

00:13:48.754 --> 00:13:52.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's
the extent of the departure.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:03.510
Let me just-- it
doesn't want to stop.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.950
Red-- red means, I
think, that it's--

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.460
yeah.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.890
It means it's faster
than 60 cycles a second.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.800
The frequency locally is higher.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.490
Blue means it's slower.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.350
So you're getting
a-- you're getting

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.550
a pattern a distortion--
slight distortion-- in system

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.900
frequency.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:28.040
Now, in this case,
nothing terrible happened.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.360
Blackout happened in Florida.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.050
Boom.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.300
Disturbance propagates
throughout the whole Eastern

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.370
Interconnect within
a matter of seconds.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.080
So, A, nobody could
respond to that.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.130
And nobody looking at the data
on-- the graph on the left

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:48.920
or the map on the
right could think

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.990
through what to do in time.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.540
If there were something
serious, that's just

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.300
too fast with so much data.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.390
So the great thing
about these units

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.270
is they give control systems--

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:08.000
control centers-- a picture of
the grid over a wide scale that

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
has never existed before
in real time, lots of data.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.490
This is just one aspect of
it, frequency distortion.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.680
But nobody knows
what to do with it.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.130
There's another picture that
is in the movie, which says

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.560
if you look before the 2000--

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.180
when was the last
big blackout, 2008--

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:37.270
you see a phase angle
change near Cleveland

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.270
over a period of about 30
seconds and then it breaks.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.170
So if you actually knew
what that angle should be,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.880
and measured it, and
had a monitoring system,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.250
you might have been able
to tell that the system was

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.160
about to break.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.380
But not everybody that
has one of these units

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.810
actually shares
data in real time.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.548
We don't have control systems
to use the data in real time.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.090
The federal government
has subsidized

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.120
putting these boxes out
there to measure the system.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.182
But we don't have the
ability to respond.

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:17.140
I mean, you're sitting
there in a control room.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.220
You see this thing.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.233
Is this a problem,
is it not a problem?

00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:22.900
All of a sudden, frequencies are
changing throughout the Eastern

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.442
Interconnect.

00:16:23.442 --> 00:16:28.070
Do I need to isolate New England
to avoid a blackout up here?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.120
Well, the answer,
it turns out was no.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.510
But without a lot
of automation, you

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.970
wouldn't be-- and a good
model of the system,

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.070
you wouldn't be
able to know that.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:47.040
So moving right along.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:55.320
So you see the issue that we've
got this incredible source

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.200
of real-time data,
with no ability

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.240
to use it and not much sharing.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.920
And your tax dollars
have produced it.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.590
It's terrific.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.380
But we don't know how to use it.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.700
I mentioned these devices that
control the transmission system

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.050
and enhance capacity.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.910
They're expensive.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.680
The ideal way to
use them would be

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.170
to use this data from
phasor measurement units

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.450
through an automated
control system

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.069
to modify line characteristics.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.020
We've got the fax devices.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.700
We've got the phasor
measurement units.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.900
We do not have any
system to link them.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.230
So we think that's
sort of a useful thing

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.480
to do since the
boxes are out there.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.090
It's also the case
that there are

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.750
a lot of so-called smart
grid technologies going in

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.880
at the distribution level.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.190
Your tax dollars, or
rather the deficits

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.120
you will fund later
on, have funded

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.710
putting out a lot of very smart
boxes in distribution systems.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.110
But what they do hasn't
yet been published.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.750
So it's a little unclear.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.240
AARA is the stimulus
legislation.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.160
So we need more
R&D, pretty cheap

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.820
R&D. We need computational
tools to use all this data.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.950
It should have impressed
you with how closely

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.470
coupled that whole
Eastern Interconnect is.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.890
That from Florida to Minnesota,
very quickly a disturbance

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.910
propagates.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.540
That means, if you think about
it, particularly if you think

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.910
about renewables, which
I'll come to in a second,

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.850
you need to be able to
plan at the level of--

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.520
at that level, at the level
of the Eastern system.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.770
The Western system is simpler.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.940
Texas is simpler.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.400
The Eastern system
is the big one.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.760
We can't begin to plan that.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.900
The dimensionality is too
high for current techniques.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:59.180
And just to get to things I
will come to in a little while,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.490
there's a lot of focus on
preventing cyber attacks.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.907
There's very little
effort on what

00:19:02.907 --> 00:19:04.700
do you do when you
get one, one succeeds.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.010
But one will succeed.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:13.790
And we need to understand
more about automated--

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.680
about dynamic pricing.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.930
I'll come to it.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.670
This is a troublesome thing.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.690
There are technologies that have
been standard in Scandinavia

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.730
for 20 years, that are
required in India, that

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.580
can't be sold in this country
because no utility has ever

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.710
seen it work.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.860
The level of risk aversion
is kind of breathtaking.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.070
And it's like, why
don't we measure things?

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.400
Because if we put it in, and
it's new, and it doesn't work,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.110
the utility gets hammered.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.030
The utility management
gets hammered.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.500
The stockholders get punished.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.150
And the regulator gets punished.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.570
If you put it in and it
works, everybody yawns.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.450
So the regulatory system
here in particular

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.780
is biased against
innovation in a way

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.320
that's hard to fix
because it's political.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.160
It's not technical.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.590
It's political.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.263
OK, what about renewables?

00:20:06.263 --> 00:20:08.180
Well, there's going to
be more wind and solar.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.530
This is renewable generation
in the US, up to 2007.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.140
You see the big story is--

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.510
the big growth story is wind.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.160
Wood is very important.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.900
A lot of that is waste
from lumber mills,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.700
that they just use
it to generate power.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.820
Some of them sell to the
grid, some of them don't.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.030
Maine, a few years ago,
passed a requirement

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.040
for renewable generation.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.880
Did the numbers.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.390
Realized they had already
met the requirement because

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.400
of all the lumber mills.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.085
You'll see solar here.

00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:44.120
Solar is in the data.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.990
But it's too small to
see in the picture.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.740
Since 2007, you see this peaks
at about-- what do you figure--

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.850
100,000.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.230
It's 173,000 in 2010.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.730
Over half of that was wind.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.840
So you see the wind--

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.080
wind has continued to drive
the growth through 2010.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.330
So that's renewables in the US.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.160
There are a lot of policies.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.500
That's Europe.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.470
This is putting aside hydro.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.840
We were way ahead of
Europe around 1990.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.960
We've stayed pretty
constant as a percentage

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.280
of total generation.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.500
Europe has shot up.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.120
And the European goal--

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.190
the EU goal is--

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.530
well, 20% of all
energy from renewables.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:35.540
So 35% of electricity
from renewables by 2020--

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.510
very, very ambitious.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.000
There is-- well, you see Maine.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.840
This is 2007, non-hydro
renewable generation

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.150
as a percentage of
the state total.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:51.140
Maine leads because
of all the wood.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.190
California, pretty high;
mostly geothermal, but wind

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.450
and solar coming.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:03.340
And Texas, just an absolute
generation, with a lot of wind,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.502
a lot of wind.

00:22:06.502 --> 00:22:09.930
This is a policy map.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.930
It shows you the 29 states
and the District of Columbia

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.830
have renewable
portfolio standards.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.500
Those are state
laws that require--

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.130
generally, that require
if you sell electricity

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.990
at retail, x percent of
that has to be renewable.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.880
Usually much more detail--

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.890
you know.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.600
New Jersey has a requirement
for off-shore, in-state wind.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.040
North Carolina has a requirement
for electricity produced from--

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.820
I think it's
poultry waste, maybe

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.410
a separate one for swine waste.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.910
And they all vary.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.610
Rhode Island has three
different levels of requirement.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:02.200
So there's a lot of
push for renewables.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.660
They're called renewable
portfolio standards

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.260
because the notion is, in
your portfolio of generation

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.010
so much of it has
to be renewable.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.640
And we could talk
about how these work.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.050
But-- well, they're
all different.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:25.930
But you don't necessarily have
to be physically connected

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:27.880
to a renewable generator.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.250
But you have to
make a purchase that

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.650
amounts to encouraging
that much generation.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.910
I used to be able to say
that every state but Arkansas

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.350
subsidized renewables.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.010
But Arkansas put in
a subsidy in 2010.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.090
So every state subsidizes
renewables now.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.320
Now, here's issue one.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.270
Issue one is, here's
where the wind is.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.290
There's a lot of good wind
offshore, in the Great Lakes.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.910
But offshore is expensive.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.880
The good onshore
wind tends to be

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.280
in the middle of the country.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.287
People tend not to be in
the middle of the country.

00:24:12.287 --> 00:24:13.870
So if you're going
to use that, you're

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.970
going to have to
build transmission.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:21.290
And that transmission is going
to have to cross state lines.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.305
I mean, there's a lot
of wind in North Dakota.

00:24:23.305 --> 00:24:25.180
There are not a lot of
people in North Dakota

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.105
despite the shale boom.

00:24:27.105 --> 00:24:28.480
If you're going
to use that wind,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.180
you're probably going to have
to go from North Dakota, oh,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.940
at least to Minneapolis,
and maybe down to Chicago,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.690
which is a problem.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.770
Even in New England--

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.560
this is an impossible map.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.840
But it shows you where the wind
is in New England, up here.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.370
That's offshore.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:53.740
This is where the load is
in Massachusetts, and Rhode

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.930
Island, and Connecticut.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.300
To get wind from Northern
Maine, down here,

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.660
you've got across state lines.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:08.780
The problem is, states
approve power lines.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.910
And states can
block power lines.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:17.810
So my favorite is there was
a proposal from Southern

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.540
California Edison to
build a line into Arizona,

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.970
to connect to some
cheap generation,

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.250
and take the power
to Los Angeles.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.430
And the Arizona
Commission vetoed it.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.505
And one commissioner
said, that's a 230,000--

00:25:31.505 --> 00:25:36.320
a 230-mile straw sucking
energy out of Arizona.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.260
We won't do it.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.380
OK, each state
can block it if it

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.283
crosses federally
owned land, which

00:25:44.283 --> 00:25:46.200
is I think a third of
the land in the country.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.620
The federal agency can block it.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.450
Nobody can say, yes.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.010
We can build gas pipelines
because those are federally--

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.770
federally done.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.440
The FERC approves gas pipelines.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.680
There is no such
approval for power lines.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.670
Well, if you're going to do
renewables, there has to be.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.580
So one of our recommendations
is to change that law.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.040
This is not necessarily
popular at the state level.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.260
Because as I said,
there's a lot of holding

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.480
of power by the states.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.180
But if you want to build renew--
you want to use renewables that

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:33.240
come from remote
areas, you need to have

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.690
somebody who can say yes.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.480
OK so far?

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.140
Questions on any of this?

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.180
OK, that's one issue
with renewables.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.800
The other issue with
renewables is the fact

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.630
that you can't dispatch them.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.670
You can't control them.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:27:01.710
This is-- that's the output
from a photovoltaic plant,

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.570
solar cells, on a
partly cloudy day.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.390
The output can
change very rapidly,

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.620
in a matter of seconds.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.740
There is no inertia
in the system,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.290
no inertia in the system.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.210
Now, if you a bunch of them,
spread out geographically,

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:24.502
this problem is reduced, but
not eliminated because sometimes

00:27:24.502 --> 00:27:25.710
a whole state will be cloudy.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.890
So that's a real issue.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.170
And the no inertia means--

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:39.750
you think about the way power
systems currently operate,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.290
there's a lot of rotating metal
in generators, and turbines,

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.660
and such, but particularly
in generators.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.700
So if all of a sudden, 5,000
people turn on the lights,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.530
that's a big increase in load.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.220
But the system has what you
call ride through capability.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.900
You know, you've
got all this inertia

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.760
going through-- going
in the generators.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.960
It just carries
you through bumps.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.290
Well, there's no inertia here.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.082
There's nothing carrying
you through bumps.

00:28:06.082 --> 00:28:09.480
And there's no real
inertia in wind turbines.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.000
Not a serious
problem at all, yet.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.360
But as you look down the road to
a lot of it, potentially it is.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.750
Wind-- this is total output
of wind in California.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.770
The top line and the bottom
line are individual facilities.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:30.780
And the access-- these are--

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.160
well, this is a
whole day, right.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.300
So it's 10 seconds--

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.650
10-second second sampling.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.390
These are hours.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.730
And this is sort of
characteristic of wind.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.300
Wind-- wind ramps,
not minutes or seconds

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.500
really, except for maybe
some individual windmill

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.520
that gets a gust.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.430
But over any
reasonable area, it can

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:54.750
ramp in the course of hours,
from nothing to a lot,

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.210
or from a lot to nothing.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.670
Both of those are problems.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:04.200
This is the most discouraging
graph I've seen on wind.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.160
This is a week in
July 2006, when

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.590
it was very hot in California.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.410
And the green is
wind generation.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.542
So you'll notice that--

00:29:16.542 --> 00:29:19.950
it has wind capacity
of 2,600 megawatts.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:25.680
That week wind never produced
more than a thousand.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.160
And it varies over the course
of the day, substantially.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.270
But here's the kicker.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.290
The red dots are the
times of the system peak.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:39.330
The red dots are when the
system really needed power--

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.930
late afternoon, in
a very hot week.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.040
When it's really hot, the wind
tends not to blow that much.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.400
So not only is there
a lot of variation

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.210
that the system has to respond
to, but at least in this case,

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.960
the peak out--
the output at peak

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.780
was tiny relative to capacity.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.100
So wind farms tend to have
capacity factors, 20s and 30s.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.660
That is to say, about 20%
to 30% of nominal capacity.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.220
If you ran at 2,600 megawatts,
24 hours a day, you'd get x.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.130
What you actually get over
x is the capacity factor.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.980
And it tends-- they
tend to be 20%, 30%.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.900
Solar, not so much at night.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.920
So that's the other
problem with renewables,

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.850
that you can't dispatch them.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.220
They're variable,
variable energy resources,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.420
as the phrase goes.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.070
This is another
terrific picture.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.720
This is Bonneville.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.570
This is the Pacific Northwest.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:53.020
And this is over the course
of 2009, early December 2009.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.600
Saturday night, wind the
output goes from nothing,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.270
so around 2,000 megawatts.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.310
Holds during the
day Sunday, Sunday

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.290
is not a high
demand day, and then

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.960
just as you're coming
into Monday, ramps down

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.610
to 0 by Monday night.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.830
Now we're told that
Bonneville handled that.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.590
Bonneville handled
that by backing off

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.440
everything they could
possibly back off,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.600
and then bringing everything
they could possibly

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.810
bring up back online.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.570
Not easy.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.180
Double it, and the
system wouldn't have been

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.410
able to handle it, probably.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:40.900
So wind output, solar output,
are more variable than demand.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.120
And you can't
predict them as well.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.370
There's a lot of work on
predicting these things.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.870
There has not been
a lot of research

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.010
on forecasting wind
at 50-meter heights;

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.520
has not been a subject of
much interest in meteorology

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.690
until recently.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.090
It's very interesting now.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:06.940
Hard to get data, not a lot of
weather stations at 50 meters.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.480
There are a lot of other
changes and thinking

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.220
about how you
reconfigure the system.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.720
The interesting
thing from the point

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.210
of view of the market design
is you don't just need capacity

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.070
in a power system.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.060
What you need now is
capacity that can ramp,

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.720
can go up fast, down fast.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.490
The current market design
doesn't provide incentives

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.310
for building that
kind of capacity

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.330
or for making it available.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.350
So again, as we go
forward, it's going

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:45.260
to be important to figure
out how to do this.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.650
How do we make the system
more flexible so it

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:54.900
can respond to wind and solar
at higher levels of penetration?

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.780
Now, one answer that
everybody has is storage.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.880
And here's from a recent
report on storage technologies.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.810
There are lots of storage
technologies, lots of them.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.860
The ones in widespread
use are pump storage.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.850
And pump storage is
terrific at this, perfect.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:18.990
There's a round trip loss.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.070
You pump water uphill.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.690
You run it down
through a turbine.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.050
It's great.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:27.790
You can start it fast, not
seconds, but pretty fast.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.570
You can stop it pretty
fast, not instantly.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.040
You got a lot of rotating metal.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.910
But you can stop it pretty fast.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.605
But you can't build it.

00:33:38.605 --> 00:33:39.730
There's one in New England.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.610
Nobody imagines we'll ever
be able to build another one.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.140
It's the problem
of building dams.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.600
You can't build dams.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.620
So this is a technology
that's in some use,

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.620
you could build more of.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:56.230
But this is
compressed air, mostly

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.260
in a cavern of one
kind or another.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.540
Put a lot of air
in under pressure,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.560
drive a turbine
when it comes out.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.460
You can do that.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.340
There are about three of
them I think in the world.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.949
And then there are
all these batteries--

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.710
and supercapacitors,
which are kind of cute--

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.449
and flywheels.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.000
And they work.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.260
These are known technologies.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:20.964
We can build these.

00:34:20.964 --> 00:34:21.922
These are sort of neat.

00:34:21.922 --> 00:34:25.593
These are batteries that are--

00:34:25.593 --> 00:34:30.550
that basically work off either
liquid cathodes or anodes.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.750
And things flow.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:32.920
And it's great stuff.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:39.850
And but they're all
really expensive at scale.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.530
This, you can sort of
afford if you can build it.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:47.650
This is OK where you
have a suitable site.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.210
Not great, but it's OK.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.020
And all this other
stuff is expensive.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.400
So it's very hard.

00:34:58.264 --> 00:35:02.080
This is the Holy Grail in
electric power research.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.800
If you could do cheap
grid level storage,

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.450
solar and wind would
not be a problem.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:16.430
But with technologies
we now know, you can't.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.230
This stuff just does
not look to have

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.030
the prospect of
becoming cheap enough

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.913
to deploy at scale by 2030.

00:35:24.913 --> 00:35:25.580
Could you do it?

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.210
Sure.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.380
Could you afford
it, probably not.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.410
OK, questions so far.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.290
It's kind of a downer.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.100
But there we are.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.480
I mean, it is what it is.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.980
And-- now the third thing.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.970
They're remote.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.110
They're intermittent.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.480
And they're expensive.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.420
So what do you do?

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.741
You can do R&D. We've done some.

00:35:57.741 --> 00:35:59.280
You could do more easily.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.600
There is an interesting
question of, should you

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.080
bring renewables on
by subsidizing them

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.390
or should you
bring renewables on

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.140
by taxing what you
don't like, which

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.295
is possibly coal, or carbon,
or oil, or some mixture?

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.800
There are carbon taxes in
various places in the world,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.610
not that many.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.730
What the US has done--

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.810
at the state level, we've
had these requirements.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:42.160
What the Europeans have done
is to basically pay prices.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.670
So if you put up a
solar farm in Germany,

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:49.410
your revenue per kilowatt hour
is guaranteed for 20 years.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.720
In the US, you've got
to find a utility that

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.431
wants to deal with you, for
the fact that you're renewable.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.170
One argument is, why do we
do it that way in the US?

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.760
There are lots of
problems with it.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.960
Because the cost is hidden.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.240
It hides the cost, I
think is the main reason.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.827
It hides the cost.

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.660
In Germany, I mean you
know there's a price.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.827
It's posted.

00:37:12.827 --> 00:37:13.910
In Spain, there's a price.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.110
It's posted.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.020
In the US, how much
does solar and wind

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.490
add to our electric bills?

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.550
We don't have a clue.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:25.510
Because there's--
there are deals done.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.820
But they're not
typically public.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.975
So we don't know.

00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:33.010
The fact that-- you may or may
not have followed that onshore

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.510
wind was--

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.190
that the Cape Wind--
you all remember

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:42.690
Cape Wind, this project to
build a bunch of windmills

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:49.380
off Cape Cod, hugely
controversial, also expensive?

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.110
People were shocked
that the price

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.600
to be paid for that electricity
was three times the going

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.800
wholesale rate.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.240
Shocked.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.530
Well, you're building windmills
offshore, in the ocean,

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.480
with transmission.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.960
And gas is really cheap.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.310
People were shocked because--

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.727
there were a number
of interviews.

00:38:09.727 --> 00:38:12.610
People said, well,
the wind is free.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.060
OK, the wind is free.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.600
So we do this--

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.110
the other thing we
do is tax breaks.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:26.250
And tax breaks give
you this pattern.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:32.520
This is wind additions
in megawatts over time.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.800
And you might ask, why
it looks like that?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.200
Whenever you see weird
business conduct,

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.620
the first thing you might
want to look at is tax policy.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.330
These are the years in which
either the tax subsidy was

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.765
absent or in which
it wasn't clear it

00:38:50.765 --> 00:38:51.765
was going to be renewed.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.980
And when that
happens, people stop.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.290
And, of course, if you want
to build a wind industry,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:02.350
that's insane because
it means you can't ever

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.410
gear up for production
because next year you

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.480
might not have any orders.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.760
It's also a little
problem with using--

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.980
we use tax breaks, too,
because that hides the cost.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.000
You can cut revenue and
subsidize renewable power--

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.970
or cut taxes and subsidize
renewable power in one

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.890
fell swoop.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.410
That's just fabulous.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.050
But, of course, if the firm
doesn't have any profits,

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.620
it can't use a
profits tax break.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.680
And a lot of money is
wasted making that work.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.010
We also don't enforce much.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:46.620
So we have probably the
worst possible policy mix.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.670
And the only explanation
I've ever heard

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.020
is that it's perfectly
designed to hide the costs.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.580
The tax breaks-- who
knows how much we spend.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.875
I mean, you can--

00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:02.710
it can be found
out, but not easily.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.650
How much does it add
to the cost of power?

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.150
Well, it doesn't.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.300
It adds to your income taxes.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.490
What about these
renewable standards,

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.080
what do they add to
the cost of power?

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.420
Well, hard to know; bunches of
deals, bunches of contracts,

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.430
not ever really reported.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.010
So we hide the cost pretty well.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.860
A carbon tax would be
a much better approach.

00:40:31.168 --> 00:40:32.710
I should tell you,
this is actually--

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.550
I find this fascinating.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.280
But the latest word
from Washington

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.250
is that the carbon
tax is coming back.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.607
Remember cap and
trade, the climate bill

00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:44.690
that we were going to have
because both candidates

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.190
in the last
presidential election

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:50.330
supported having a cap and
trade program, which went down

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.300
to defeat as cap and tax?

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.270
Well, there now is serious--
serious work going on

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.400
in Washington, as
far as I can tell,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.890
on both sides of the aisle,
preparing carbon tax bills.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.940
They don't mention climate.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.560
Turns out, it's OK to tax carbon
if you don't mention climate.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.190
You mention revenue,
energy self-sufficiency.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.960
So we're going to
have a carbon tax--

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.970
we may have a carbon
tax to raise revenue

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:21.600
without the word "climate"
being uttered in the debate.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.830
It's fabulous stuff.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.670
Anyway, that's renewables.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.560
Questions, comments, reactions?

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.110
You're not terminally
depressed by all that?

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.210
OK.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.550
All right, I'll
depress you some more.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.600
Let's talk about prices.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.150
Prices don't reflect the
nature of actual costs.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.010
Demand varies over time.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.690
You saw last time
a supply curve.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.185
That says prices vary over time.

00:41:57.185 --> 00:42:01.910
These are average-- these are
daily average prices over 2010,

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.890
in the PJM market area.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.470
That began is Pennsylvania,
Jersey, Maryland.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.430
It's now broader.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.280
It's the biggest electricity
market in the country.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.900
And you notice a
bunch of things.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.880
You notice they vary.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.407
You can sort of see
a seasonal pattern.

00:42:16.407 --> 00:42:18.740
They tend to be a little
higher in the summer on average

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.140
than they are other
times of the year.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.500
Not that much higher, because
other times of the year

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.540
you do your maintenance.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.940
So the supply curve
shifts when you take units

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.830
off to maintain them.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.230
This must have been a
particularly hot day.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.980
Who knows what happened
here in December?

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.810
A unit went off.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:42.740
So the point here is you'd
have kind of a hard time.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.060
You could predict this
maybe that, yeah, it

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.293
tends to be lower in
the spring, and maybe

00:42:49.293 --> 00:42:50.210
what the hell is that?

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.320
But you'd predict basically
a summer peak in prices.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.270
But you'd miss a lot.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.670
You'd miss a lot
of the variation.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:05.640
You're talking down from $20
a megawatt hour up to $120.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.740
And this is not--

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.470
if we deaveraged and
didn't do daily averages,

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.930
you'd get more of
a spread than that.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.880
You can get several
orders of magnitude spread

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.980
in marginal cost of electricity.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.140
You do not see that at home.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:22.370
If you looked at the daily
level, it's even more striking.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:27.230
This is a couple of
days in 2010 by hour.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.860
And you see on whatever--
whichever of the two days

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.070
this is, you had
your morning peak

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.650
and you had your afternoon peak.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.780
OK, you could kind
of predict that.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.660
I have no idea what
happened on this day.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.370
This is like 1:00 or 2:00 in the
afternoon, the prices shoot up.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.060
And that's real.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.790
That's the cost of generating
electricity at the margin.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.230
That's a marginal cost.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.470
And it's at $300
a megawatt hour,

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.290
they've put up pulled all
the old dirty diesels out

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:01.610
and turned them on
for an hour or two.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.510
So you can't forecast that.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.820
You don't pay that.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.950
Small commercial and
residential users

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.770
don't see that
variation in cost.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.620
Oranges get more
expensive at wholesale,

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.180
they're more
expensive at retail.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.930
Power gets more expensive,
at wholesale nothing happens.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:25.730
Now, it could happen.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.520
I mentioned earlier,
advanced meters.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.170
What advanced meters do is
advanced meters basically

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.020
record usage at shorter
short intervals,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.310
say 15 minutes; can
receive price signals;

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:44.390
can send 15-minute or even
finer usage information

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.440
to the utility.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.067
So you could use these.

00:44:48.067 --> 00:44:50.150
And there are millions of
them around the country.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.870
You could use them to
charge those prices.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:03.512
You can imagine exactly
how popular that would be.

00:45:03.512 --> 00:45:05.630
You come home one day.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:09.440
And, oh, by the way you've
just spent a jillion dollars

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.180
for electricity because
something happened.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:18.190
So these meters, they're
required in California.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.430
They're required in
several other states--

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:24.070
everywhere.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.410
Federal tax dollars--
your federal tax dollars--

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:29.230
have paid for millions of them.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.732
But they're not being used.

00:45:31.732 --> 00:45:33.190
They're very smart
meters, that are

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:37.822
going to go slowly insane not
using any of that intelligence.

00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:39.280
They're not being
used for pricing.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.980
They're not being used
for measuring every 15

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.890
seconds because-- or 15
minutes because who cares?

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.900
The price is the same.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.730
So the one thing
everybody is convinced

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:57.400
of is if you just cut people
over to pricing like that,

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.010
there would be
riots in the street

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.860
because people would
have nasty surprises.

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.650
And people don't
like nasty surprises.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.000
You go away for a week.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.708
It's a heat wave.

00:46:07.708 --> 00:46:09.583
You forgot to turn off
your air conditioner--

00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:11.050
turn down your air conditioner.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:13.210
Boom, $3,000 electricity bill.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.370
You don't like that too much.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:22.000
So it seems clear to most of
us that the only way this works

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.740
is if you can have simple
automated response,

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.720
simple automated response.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.460
The main issue is going to be
air conditioning and heating.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.750
But even so, you
might like some signal

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:48.620
that says don't do your clothes
at 5:00 in the afternoon.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.560
Something that says
to you, electricity

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.880
is really expensive right now.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.960
And for some things,
it's got to be automated.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.420
The flip side of all
this price variation

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:07.060
is a change in low
duration curves.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.110
You recall, these curves you
get by stacking the power--

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.300
by measuring power
consumption each hour,

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.840
and then graphing first the
hour with the highest use, then

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.620
second highest, and so
on, down to the lowest.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:26.320
These are low duration
curves for New York,

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.010
rescaled so that the
peak is equal to 1,

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:36.760
and averaged over 1980,
'84, and 2005 to 2009.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.930
You notice they change--

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.790
it changes shape.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.370
It changes shape
kind of dramatically.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:47.000
In '80 to '84, with
this 21% is, if you

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.910
adjust size the system to
meet peak demand exactly,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:56.710
21% of your capacity would
be used fewer than a thousand

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:00.230
of the 8,760 hours in the year.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.010
That's a lot of idle capital.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:09.370
But it gets worse, 2005 to
2009, that curve is peak year--

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.050
technical term.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.510
It has a sharper peak.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:18.010
And over a third of your
capacity was used only

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.530
a thousand hours--

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.500
less than a thousand
hours a year.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.670
So why?

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:28.225
Well, the data are
what the data are.

00:48:28.225 --> 00:48:31.910
There's two explanations
that people have.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.660
The first is air conditioning.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.650
Because more central air
conditioning in particular

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.800
means more load on
hot summer days.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.890
And hot summer days
of the system peaks.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:49.360
So more air conditioning--
every unit in the state

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.070
is on these peak times.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.420
And there are more
units in the state.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.550
The other is that--

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:57.330
it's interesting.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.850
If you look at the
numbers in the '50s,

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:04.080
industrial load was about
half of electricity usage,

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.520
about half.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.350
And that tends not
to be seasonal.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.500
And it also tends to
run at night a lot.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.160
It's now down to
about 28% nationally.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.440
So if it's all industrial
load that runs 24 hours a day,

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.060
this thing is flat.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:26.100
But as you get less of that,
this back end falls off

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:30.870
and the top end goes
comparatively higher.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:35.100
Now, everybody's got
an air conditioner.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.100
But what happens when you
have an appreciable number

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.940
of electric vehicles and
everybody comes home from work

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.040
and plugs them in?

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.100
So a plug-in electric charge
that's sort of high capacity

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.840
is a house.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:52.110
I mean, it's comparable
in terms of load.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:59.400
So electric vehicles, in
areas where they penetrate,

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.558
have the ability to make
this problem a lot worse.

00:50:02.558 --> 00:50:04.350
And the reason it's a
problem is you've got

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:07.110
to pay for all that capacity.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:10.360
That's capital sitting there
that has to get paid for.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.600
So rates go up.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.570
So electric vehicles could
have a disproportionate impact,

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:20.040
if they spread, on rates.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.630
I personally don't
think they're going

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.422
to spread that much--
they're going to have

00:50:23.422 --> 00:50:24.930
great penetration by 2030.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.910
I'd love to be wrong.

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.950
But in some areas--

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:32.520
Southern California,
they expect--

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.630
probably Cambridge.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.630
I mean, who knows.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.710
But-- well, except for
batteries and cold weather.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:42.390
But Southern California
Edison monitors

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.790
automobile purchases
in Beverly Hills,

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.190
and Brentwood, and
various other rich areas

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.810
in Southern California.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:51.720
In Palo Alto, I'm told you
can see parades of Teslas

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.500
every so often.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:58.440
So there are some
areas that will have

00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.730
a lot of electric vehicles.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.710
And the obvious thing to do
is if you take it to work,

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.127
you plug it in
when you come home.

00:51:03.127 --> 00:51:05.838
And that's exactly
when the system peaks.

00:51:05.838 --> 00:51:07.380
That's exactly when
the system peaks.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.390
So it could make this worse.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:12.630
So if you can move
loads off-peak,

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.660
move charging to the
middle of the night,

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.570
have people dry their
clothes at night--

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.760
run the air conditioner,
as I'm told Walmart does,

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.770
really hard at 5:00 and
6:00 in the morning,

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:29.010
and then back it off during the
day; and run it hard at noon,

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:32.550
and back it off
in the afternoon,

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:35.670
you could flatten the curve.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.270
But-- and there are
programs in which demand

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:41.405
responds to peak conditions.

00:51:41.405 --> 00:51:43.530
There are something like
2 million air conditioners

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.170
in Florida that are
centrally controlled.

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:50.130
And the utilities are allowed
to basically turn them--

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:53.070
well, turn them up in
terms of temperature

00:51:53.070 --> 00:52:00.250
in system emergencies or system
stress periods, not every day.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:05.160
But in principle, pricing
can take care of this.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.590
If you can make this
electricity really

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:10.350
expensive in those hours,
you bring that peak down,

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:16.470
use capacity more effectively,
deal with electric vehicles.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:20.373
I mean, some people have
said, well, you really

00:52:20.373 --> 00:52:23.040
shouldn't allow people to charge
their electric vehicles at 5:00

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.360
in the afternoon.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.960
That is not
politically possible.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.840
Can you imagine being told
you can't refuel your vehicle,

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.170
and go out in the evening?

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:37.350
No, that's not going to happen.

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:39.540
If you can't make it
a rule, then maybe

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.920
you have to make it expensive.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.550
Well, how do you
make it expensive?

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:44.790
Well, you use price.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.330
The technology is out there.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.010
You just have to do it.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.220
So we think this is
actually important.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.570
We also think this
is going to happen.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:53:00.030
But there has to be some way
to make it easy for households.

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:04.230
The Department of Energy,
some few years ago,

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:06.060
put out a brochure
in which you talked

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.610
about new technology will
let every household be

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:12.190
an active participant in
the electricity market.

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:16.150
Electricity is about 2% of
the average household budget.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:18.410
Milk is probably more important.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:19.910
The notion that
people actually want

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.220
to sit around and look at
electricity prices all day,

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.920
that's nutty.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.740
But you got to-- if you
want to have them respond,

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.170
they have to be able to
automate the response.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.860
And that technology is just--

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.110
a lot of people playing in it.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.540
But it's not--
it's not there yet.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.650
People like Cisco drool at
this, as you can imagine.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.960
Cisco has hired people
from electric utilities.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.120
Cisco is talking to
appliance makers.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.210
Cisco sees this as a future.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:50.570
But we're not there yet.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.690
As I say, there are a
lot of these meters out.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.460
Your tax dollars have
paid for millions

00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:58.220
of meters that are
going slowly insane,

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.900
not using their intelligence.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.800
So we actually think that
it's pretty important

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.820
to begin running sensible
experiments and sharing data,

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.670
so that we can actually
deal with this issue using

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:11.930
the technology we have.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.530
Questions here?

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.970
OK.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:24.410
Let me talk about
distributed generation.

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:28.380
This is a pure economic issue.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.560
And if you think about
it for a little while,

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.230
it's a really easy
economic issue,

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.750
but it's politically impossible.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:43.870
So there are subsidies for
distributed generation,

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:44.800
rooftop, solar.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.620
California talks about
a million solar roofs.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:52.870
Everybody loves it; except,
of course, the utilities.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:58.340
And the utilities don't
like it for two reasons.

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.750
One reason is, the
grid isn't designed

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:06.580
to have power generated out
on the edge, particularly

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.760
the distribution system.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.810
The simplest example is this.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:15.717
Suppose the utility needs to
work on a power line connecting

00:55:15.717 --> 00:55:16.300
to your house.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.380
So what do they do now?

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.660
They go to the substation
that feeds your house

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:22.860
and they turn off that circuit.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.350
OK, suppose every house
in your neighborhood

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:28.710
has a solar roof,
generating power?

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.680
Well, without those roofs,
you turn off the substation.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.180
The linemen can go
work on the line.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:33.750
It's safe.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.910
The line's dead.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:38.760
If everybody's got
a generator, you

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.440
have to make sure
they're all disconnected.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.360
And as a former dean
of engineering said,

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:49.160
let's say-- let's say, there
are 200 of them on the line.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.560
What's the probability that all
of them disconnect properly?

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.090
Oh, that's zero, close to it.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:01.340
So that's an issue
that's troublesome.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.420
Not impossible.

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.920
There are standards
being developed.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.900
There are technologies
being developed.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.180
That requires investment.

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.780
The policy problem is trickier.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.460
Shouldn't be, but it is.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.110
So it goes like this.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.750
I get an electric
bill from Instar.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.310
The electric bill has two
components, my kilowatt hour

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:26.690
consumption times an energy
charge, which is roughly

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:29.930
what they pay for
electricity on the market;

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:34.550
and the kilowatt hours I
consume times a capacity charge.

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.470
What's that?

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.120
Well, that's the
way they recover

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.145
the fixed cost of the wires.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:50.000
So if I put a solar roof on,
I save the energy charge,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.430
which the utility also saves,
and I save the capacity charge,

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:58.510
which they don't save.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:03.065
So on the one hand, there's
an extra subsidy there.

00:57:03.065 --> 00:57:04.690
In addition to whatever
other subsidies

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.990
I get for putting a solar roof
on, there's an extra subsidy.

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:12.370
I get this illusory extra
reduction in my electric bill.

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:15.130
It doesn't correspond to
anybody's cost reductions.

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:16.240
The costs are still there.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.650
The wires are still there.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.730
But I get a cut.

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:21.700
OK, that gives me
an extra incentive

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.980
to install a solar roof.

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.260
What about the utility?

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.300
Well, it gives the
utility every incentive

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.850
to make it hard for me
to install a solar roof.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.900
It's money out of their pocket.

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.180
It's money they
don't get to cover

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.620
the fixed cost of the wires.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.860
So I have a strong incentive--

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.520
a stronger incentive
to put up a solar roof.

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.610
And they have a strong
incentive to resist my

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.160
putting up a solar roof.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.970
This is not a great policy.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.580
if you care about solar roofs.

00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:00.980
The fix is straightforward
conceptually.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:09.650
That there ought to be a fixed
charge, x dollars a month,

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.400
that doesn't change with how
much electricity I consume.

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.590
And one way to convince
yourself that makes sense

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:18.770
is, suppose I install,
not a solar roof,

00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:21.590
but I install a diesel
generator in my basement.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:24.860
And the diesel generator--
which I vent the exhaust

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.860
into my neighbor's yard,
so that doesn't bother me--

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.190
so the diesel generator covers
all of my electric needs

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:33.050
when it runs.

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:36.440
But I still connect to
the grid for backup.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.530
Now, if you're only charging
me for the kilowatt hours

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:43.140
I consume, I'm getting
the backup for free.

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.660
That doesn't make sense.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.300
So there ought to
be a fixed charge.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:51.170
It could vary with your
maximum consumption.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.420
It could vary
with-- in Spain, you

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.360
contract for a certain maximum.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.800
Your charge varies with that.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.010
If you ever exceed that
maximum, it cuts you off;

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.260
very clever system.

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.880
So I would contract for backup.

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.430
I'd pay for it.

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:10.100
If the generator went
out, I pay a charge.

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.450
I'd pay for the power.

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:13.190
If the generator
doesn't go out, I still

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:16.610
pay for my share of the wires
that I have to have connecting.

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:20.090
Now, I will tell you, we
have made this presentation.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.320
I've made this presentation.

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.090
Others have made
this presentation.

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.650
The state level, the federal
level, utilities, users,

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.440
everybody nods, and
says, yeah, of course,

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.830
but we can't do that.

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:34.270
How can we do that?

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:38.012
The usual argument is, well, it
would be unfair to poor people.

00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:40.220
Well, it would be unfair to
poor people for everybody

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.770
to pay the same charge.

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:44.630
But why would everybody
pay the same charge?

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:47.210
Oh, but you then
have to discriminate.

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.897
Well, shouldn't people who
have used a lot of electricity,

00:59:49.897 --> 00:59:51.980
and have the capacity to
use a lot of electricity,

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.630
pay more than those who don't?

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:54.950
Isn't that fair?

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.540
Well, no, that's too hard.

00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.290
So this is a recommendation,
that as far as we can tell

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:03.620
has been floating around
for 20 years and more,

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.090
which may or may not
get adopted anywhere.

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.950
So finally, let me
do cybersecurity--

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.970
no clear authority.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:18.870
So here's a picture
from NIST, that

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:21.180
is sort of what
the grid will look

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.150
like the, road map for the
smart grid interoperability

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.790
standards.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:27.450
This is what they're
working off--

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:30.120
or a cartoon of what
they're working off

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.800
in generating standards.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.030
And every one of those lines
is a communication line.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.900
There's computation
in various places.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.650
There's communication
along those lines.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.477
And some of them are thousands
of pieces of equipment.

01:00:43.477 --> 01:00:45.060
Some of them, down
here in households,

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.500
are millions of
pieces of equipment.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.760
They all have to interoperate.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.510
They all talk.

01:00:51.007 --> 01:00:52.840
The standard setting
problem is hard enough.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.940
But the fact is,
they're all talking.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.180
That means there are all these
channels that can be hacked,

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.020
can have failures,
can be sabotaged.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:09.720
There was a great demonstration
a couple of years ago,

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.740
done for purposes of a video.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.200
A small turbine-- oh,
yeah, it was a diesel.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.620
A small diesel
generator was run.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.510
And they purposely
hacked the control system

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.390
and caused the
generator to connect

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:30.150
to the grid out of phase.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.350
The generator blew up.

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:35.860
Now, that's a hack that
can take-- you take out

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.990
a large piece of equipment,
and that's not like days.

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:44.080
That could be months
to fix, or years.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.110
So it's a serious issue.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:54.560
Most people are aware of it.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.920
But the response-- the
governmental response

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.650
is quite fragmented.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.010
At the federal level,
there are standards.

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:06.650
There are some compliance--
some regulation.

01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:12.110
Each state regulates
cybersecurity in its state.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:15.530
And I remember talking to one
of the commissioners from Ohio.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.240
And he said, oh,
we have workshops.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.115
We're getting all these
guys to do standards.

01:02:19.115 --> 01:02:19.970
This is fabulous.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:23.000
I said, what about the municipal
utilities and the co-ops

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.350
in Ohio?

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:28.520
Oh, well, we invite
them to come.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.530
There's no jurisdiction.

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.930
They're connected to the grid.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:36.590
So no development
or coordination

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:38.690
of standards for
distribution systems.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:43.980
Those are regulated by
the states or not at all.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:49.640
And nobody deals
with the whole grid.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.680
So it's pretty simple.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.130
The simple recommendation,
somebody ought to be in charge.

01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:58.840
There are people in
charge of cyber--

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.060
the Department of
Homeland Security

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.000
has a chart that shows
who's in charge of what.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.240
And it goes industry
by industry, usually

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.320
a match of agencies.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.120
Nobody's in charge
in electricity.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.780
The latest-- the
latest statement

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.785
from the administration is, the
Department of Homeland Security

01:03:16.785 --> 01:03:18.160
and the Department
of Energy will

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.030
coordinate on this subject.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.060
Now, you don't have to spend
too much time in organizations

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.070
to realize that means
nobody's in charge.

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.750
Everybody-- this
is a recommendation

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:34.180
that everybody agrees with.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:38.640
But there's violent
disagreement over who gets it.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.410
The administration
has said it ought

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:43.230
to be the Department
of Homeland Security.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:44.985
The relevant folks
in Congress say

01:03:44.985 --> 01:03:47.070
it should be the
Department of Energy.

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:50.490
The current compromise that says
let them play nicely together

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.820
is something that
no one thinks--

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.630
no one outside the Beltway
thinks can possibly work.

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:02.370
So this is a look at
the future of the grid.

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:04.780
It's interesting.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.620
We did this study
for two reasons.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.130
One, because we got very
tired of hearing that we

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.270
have a third-world grid.

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:13.200
And it's all broken.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.930
And we're all going to die.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.240
That seemed a little extreme.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.180
And then there's stuff
about how smart grids

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:22.740
are going to
transform our lives,

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.690
like the internet has
transformed our lives.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:27.060
And we're all going to be active
participants in the electricity

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:27.560
market.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.460
And that sounded even dumber.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.100
And we thought it
might be worthwhile

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.350
getting some economists and
engineers to actually look

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:36.060
at the grid.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.880
The conclusion we have is,
yeah, I mean, you can--

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.320
there's a way forward.

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:45.000
We're not in crisis.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.210
There are real opportunities.

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:47.335
They're not transformative.

01:04:47.335 --> 01:04:48.990
But they're real opportunities.

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:51.030
But there are problems.

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:55.080
We need to do relatively
inexpensive R&D,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.200
I mean, this is a
software development,

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.250
algorithm development.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:02.500
It's not nuclear power.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.270
We need to be smarter about
siting transmission lines.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:11.890
We need to move toward
getting retail prices right.

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:14.540
We need to deal with
network costs appropriately.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.710
We need to deal
with cybersecurity.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.200
If that all happens, you
will live happily ever after.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:19.830
Questions?

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.860
Yeah, Matthew?

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.235
AUDIENCE: Earlier
in lecture, you

01:05:25.235 --> 01:05:28.750
talked about how the
bill for the carbon tax

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.030
mentions nothing
about the environment.

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.763
What would happen if
it said, hey, this

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.680
is good for the environment,
too, as part of--

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I think
the environmental-- well,

01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:39.160
it's not a bill yet.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.650
There's no point in introducing
a bill into this Congress.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:45.190
There will be-- it is expected--

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:51.160
the expectation is that after
the election, when there's

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.720
some hope of people
actually working together,

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.050
a short window, that
proposals for a carbon tax

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.660
are going to come leaping
out of the closet.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.350
And those proposals
will talk about revenue.

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:09.520
And the environmentalists
will be relatively quiet

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.000
because if the environmentalists
talk about climate,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.830
the Republicans,
who have said there

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:19.210
is no such thing as climate,
will be backed into a corner,

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.820
even though-- some
of them have had

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:27.220
to deny climate change to be
in line with the leadership,

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.290
even though they actually
are capable of words

01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:30.920
of more than one syllable.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.860
So some of those folks would
be pushed to opposition.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.480
If you don't mention
climate, they

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.700
can quietly say, yeah,
it's good for the climate

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.038
and vote for it.

01:06:41.038 --> 01:06:42.580
I don't know if it's
going to happen.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.962
It's a cocktail
parity conversation.

01:06:44.962 --> 01:06:47.170
But it appears to be a fairly
serious cocktail parity

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:47.967
conversation.

01:06:47.967 --> 01:06:48.550
Anything else?

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:49.050
Yeah?

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:50.717
AUDIENCE: Are you
going to be presenting

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:51.940
tomorrow [INAUDIBLE]?

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.565
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I'll be presenting

01:06:53.565 --> 01:06:56.140
a longer version of this to a--

01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.580
and a somewhat different
version, but close to it--

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.360
a group of large
electricity users.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.540
And I'm very interested in what
they're going to have to say.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.040
We've talked to
state commissioners.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.250
We've talked to the
federal regulators.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:16.165
We've talked to
congressional staff.

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.940
This is the first conversation
I've had with consumers.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.230
So I'm looking forward
to it, big industrials.

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:23.160
Yeah?

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.360
AUDIENCE: Is the problem
with cybersecurity

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.610
that nobody wants to deal with
it, or everybody wants to?

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.120
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Everybody
wants to deal with it.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:28.620
Yeah.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.190
The problem is that the
Department of Homeland Security

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:37.290
has no expertise
in power systems.

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:42.030
And the Department of Energy has
no expertise in cybersecurity.

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:45.600
So whoever gets it
has to staff up.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.690
Well, staffing up is fun.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.500
You add headcounts.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.125
You add people.

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:51.360
You add payroll.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.890
You add prestige.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:56.880
So whoever does it
gets to staff up.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.440
If you split it, then you've
got sort of dueling staffs.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.610
You don't understand
anything about electricity.

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:04.110
Oh, yeah.

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:05.850
But you don't understand
about security.

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:07.630
I mean, come on.

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:08.760
That doesn't work.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:14.370
So everybody wants--
well, both people want it.

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.859
And at some point, I
assume, one of them

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:20.189
will be declared the
winner, but not soon.

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:23.029
Anything else?

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:25.749
OK, see you Wednesday.

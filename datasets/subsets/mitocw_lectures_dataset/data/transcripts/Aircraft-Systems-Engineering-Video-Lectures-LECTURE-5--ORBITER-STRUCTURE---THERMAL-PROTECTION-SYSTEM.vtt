WEBVTT

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:10.669
OK.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.379
Good morning everyone.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:21.439
As I mentioned at the last lecture, we're
now moving into the nitty-gritty of the subsystems.

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.660
And we have quite an extraordinary list of
speakers who actually worked on the original

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.140
design of these systems.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.430
And, as Professor Cohen mentioned, not only
did they design these systems for the shuttle

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.440
but, in most cases, they came from having
designed essentially the same systems on the

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.380
Apollo program.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.460
So, in the question and answer period, if
there are some things that you'd like to know

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.570
about the comparison of Apollo and Shuttle,
and also any questions about the future since

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.910
some of you will be writing up possibilities
for future development of some of these systems,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.079
please ask the questions.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:08.390
And I spoke with Tom Moser, and he's fully
prepared to handle questions during the talk.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.460
Because there will be a lot of fairly detailed
technical stuff, so if there's something that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.560
you're not familiar with, you don't understand
or just have questions about, please ask while

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.700
the lecture is going on.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.990
I want to remind you, we have fairly extensive
bios for all the speakers.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.158
Rather than take the time in class to read
through this, I've posted them all on the

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.770
class website.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:43.840
So my suggestion is go to the class website
before each class and just see the background

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.500
of the lecture.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.189
Professor Cohen is going to make some personal
remarks about, well, whatever it is that you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.210
want to say about our speaker.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.799
Before we go into that, two things.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.380
Tom Moser asked me if we had this book.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.570
This actually is my personal copy.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.399
I'm going to put it on reserve.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.478
We may actually have it in the library as
well.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:15.810
I'll check, and I'll make sure that this gets
on reserve.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.099
This really is a rather complete book.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.900
A lot the material that you've seen, the early
design of the shuttle is in here, discussions

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.040
of subsystems, and then detailed discussions
of the individual flights all the way up through

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.370
the first hundred shuttle flights.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.739
It's a very nice resource, and we'll have
it on reserve in the library.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.480
The next thing.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:52.690
I believe I have now indications from everybody
about what you want to do your paper on.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.829
We have two groups doing GN&C.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.310
One group doing displays and controls.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.519
We had two small groups interested in the
propulsion system.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.129
And I've asked Brian and other people, you've
gotten together?

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.170
OK.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.190
Only one person, Dan, I think, indicated an
interest in the thermal protection system.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.579
I know we've got a lot people on GN&C.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.030
One of you, I think, had actually indicated
an interest in thermal protection.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.959
I will leave that up to you.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.780
If somebody would like to work on thermal
protection with Dan, he's back there and is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.500
available, I guess.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.540
We have one group which is going to do a little
bit of a different sort of project on modularity

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.519
and some of the design methods that went into
the shuttle compared to modern techniques

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.090
that are available now, so we'll be interested
in seeing what you'll come up with.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.510
And then we had a group that wants to look
at the propulsion system, but from the point

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.489
of view of fuel storage and what the system
would have looked like if we had possibly

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.750
used alternate fuels.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.079
We've got a nice spectrum of things that people
will look at.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.599
Any time you'd like to come and talk with
me, with Professor Cohen or take advantage

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.240
of one of the speakers who happens to be talking
about the area that you're interested in,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.780
please do that.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.909
We do have time usually after class, if you're
free.

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.490
The speakers will generally be available so
take advantage of it.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.710
OK.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.790
That's enough talking from me.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:57.940
Aaron, I'll give this to you..

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.040
I just have a few personal comments about
Mr. Moser.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.440
He is going to talk to you today, lecture
you today about the structures on the space

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.500
shuttle.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.190
But Tom, as Jeff mentioned, did the same work
on the Apollo program.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.419
I was the manager of the Command and Service
Module on Apollo and on the Space Shuttle

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.430
Orbiter, so Tom and I have been working tighter
for many years.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.560
And I relied very, very heavily on Tom throughout
the years.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.180
I told a little anecdote the other day, and
just let me say it again because the person

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.860
that helped me with it is Tom Moser.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.229
During one of the shuttle missions, we were
getting ready to come back, about 11:00 at

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.650
night, I was getting ready to leave my house
to go to the Control Center, which I live

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.289
about ten minutes away, and we were getting
ready to make the de-orbit burn, I got a call

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.800
from Rockwell International, their head of
the program there.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.409
And he said, Aaron, we just did this test.

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:05.210
We took the panel of tiles and dumped it into
a bucket of waterproofing agent and all the

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.960
tiles came off.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.350
I said what do you want me to do with that
information?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.639
I said they're getting ready to come back
and there's not much I can do about that.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.850
You're telling me all the tiles are going
to come off?

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.669
He said no, they're not because that's not
really what we did on the shuttle.

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:20.819
I said well, why did you do that test?

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:21.830
That's sort of a dumb test.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.759
I had a decision to make, whether I'd call
the people in the Control Center like Chris

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.560
Kraft and tell him we did this test and all
the tiles are going to come off.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.819
But we've got to come back.

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.360
I decided what I would do is call my good
colleague Tom Moser.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.940
I said Tom, what should we do?

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.810
We talked for a while and talked for a while,
and we decided to keep this information to

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.130
ourselves until after the landing.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.120
It turns out it all worked out fine.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.659
There were no problems.

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.610
But my point to you is that how much I relied
on Tom.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.319
The other point is you may find yourself in
that type of situation some day on a project

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.020
maybe not associated with that.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:09.060
Tom turned out to be afterward my Deputy Manager
in the Orbiter Project Office.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.539
Then he went on to become Head of Engineering
at the Johnson Space Center and then went

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:20.380
on to be Director of the Space Station in
Washington, DC and now is a consultant.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.660
So, with no further ado, let me turn it over
to Tom.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.840
One thing I learned to do is have my own mic
because Aaron will keep it.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.770
One of the advantages to having a gray beard,
besides some of the folks in the back, is

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.909
I'm not going to refer to him as Professor
Cohen or as Professor Hoffman.

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:44.159
It's Jeff and Aaron.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.699
It's not out of disrespect.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:53.409
It's just the way I grew up so that's OK to
do.

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:58.860
When Aaron asked me to do this, and Jeff,
I thought that's easy, I'll just pull out

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.270
some of my old notes and stuff like that and
I will be up the next day.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:09.789
Until Jeff sent me the syllabus and what it
was to do, it made me start thinking about

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.919
what I'd spent a good part of my life doing.

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:15.690
And that was designing and development of
the shuttle with Aaron and some of the others,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.080
but from a systems engineering perspective
which you guys are doing.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.220
So, what I did is I went back and looked at
everything from a systems engineering point

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.879
of view from 1968 all the way until '81 when
the shuttle flew.

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:32.068
But I looked at it through the knothole of
a structure and thermal person.

00:08:32.068 --> 00:08:34.568
So, that's what I'm going to present to you
today.

00:08:34.568 --> 00:08:38.690
And, as you go through each phase of the program
it changes.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:44.800
And sometimes it's down to the minute detail
and other times it is the macro.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.740
That's my objective, and I hope we accomplish
that.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:53.600
Ask me any questions any time that you want
to.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.760
Just a little bit of credit and recognition
of some of the people that made this thing

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.040
happen.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.760
You're going to hear from a lot of these people.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.019
You won't hear from John Yardley or Max Faget
because they are deceased now, but these people

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:11.360
up here made this program go.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.740
And then you will have also some references
that give you a lot more detail than I'm going

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.170
to give you today, even though I'm going to
cover a lot of it.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:26.450
There is one unique thing about a program
like this that is complex.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.760
And that is the technical team and the management
team have to work together and get together.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:43.700
Everybody that is listed up there stayed on
this program from day one, and that is key.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.760
I don't think there has been a program since
then that that has happened.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.060
And I think that if people judge the Shuttle
Program as being successful, I think that

00:09:53.060 --> 00:10:02.370
that's a major contribution to that success.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:08.820
Beginning in '68 when the concept studies
began, all the way down to operations from

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.200
a structural perspective, what is important
at each one of those phases in its weight

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.769
and cost and produceability from day one.

00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:22.399
But then it gets into the certification phase,
the last part of the program, how are you

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.519
going to certify this thing?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.860
How are you going to prove that it's good
for flight?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.860
How are you going to prove that the crew is
safe?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.839
And you have to do it on the ground.

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:34.040
So, it's a completely different knothole you're
looking through and a completely different

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.339
set of parameters.

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:41.010
I didn't start on Apollo at the beginning
like Aaron did.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.850
I came out a little bit later.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:51.060
But, in this program, I had the good fortune
of working on it from sketchpad to launch

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.240
pad.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.910
And that's the way I characterized it.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.839
And Aaron didn't know this, but at the end
I would have worked for free to complete the

00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:01.180
program because I was going to see something
from beginning to end.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.620
And so if you ever had that opportunity to
get on the program at the very beginning,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.140
I don't care what knothole you're looking
at it through, stay on that program if you

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.700
can because it's a completely different life
at every step along the way.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.940
So, from the knothole of Orbiter structure,
I'm going to break this thing into two pieces,

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:36.589
Orbiter structure and the thermal protection
system..

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:41.600
On the concept studies that began in '68,
what was the objective of those concept studies?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.560
Conceiving, characterizing and characterizing
by qualitative and quantitative concepts that

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.779
would appear to work.

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:56.950
So, it was determining really the feasibility
of the concepts.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:04.510
When that began, the only requirement in the
Shuttle Program was to have a reusable space

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.910
transportation system.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:12.370
Get something that goes from earth to low
earth orbit and back reliably and reusable.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.079
There wasn't a requirement on payload size,
there wasn't a requirement on number of missions,

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:20.209
there wasn't a requirement on any of those
things.

00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:21.510
That's what it was.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:27.990
The variables that we all looked at, though,
were budgets, yearly budgets, developments

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.990
costs, operations cost.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:34.170
And you'll see, as you go through some of
this stuff, and probably some of the stuff

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:39.350
that Dale Myers showed you, is development
cost, you can spend a lot of money on development

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.910
and reduce the operations cost or you can
spend a little bit of money on development

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.089
and have very high operational cost.

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:45.970
So, there's a trade there.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.480
And when you're dealing with budgets that
you really don't understand exactly what they

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.700
are, that's a very important variable.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.470
Payload mass and size is important from a
structural and thermal standpoint because

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:04.459
it has to do with mass and it has to do with
energy that has to be dissipated during reentry.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:06.519
The operational orbit is important.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:12.300
Fully reusable flight systems or partially
reusable, and that's a trade on cost and weight.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.660
Turnaround time and cross-range.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:20.800
Cross-range was critical to us at this point
because NASA didn't have a requirement for

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.529
cross-range.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:25.519
And that's cross-range after you come back
into the atmosphere to be able to deviate

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.540
your normal ballistic trajectory coming back
in.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.920
But the Air Force thought that they had a
requirement so we had to include that.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:46.589
And then, as we got into the next phase of
it, looking at what was important from a structural

00:13:46.589 --> 00:13:53.510
standpoint is the efficiency of the load path,
the weight, the payload size, the aerodynamic

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.370
surface loading, now we're beginning to get
in and look at what are the wing loads, et

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:10.040
cetera, and how does that manifest itself
in weight and produceability?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:18.829
We did that under two years of contracted
effort.

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:24.339
Then within JSC, the Johnson Space Center,
which was formally the Manned Space Craft

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:29.300
Center, we conceptionally looked at designs
in-house.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.459
And we looked at 53 different designs.

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:36.959
You talk about a systems engineering thing,
what we did was got a group of people about

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:41.040
the size of this room and went away and locked
ourselves up.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.660
But we had expertise in every area, propulsion,
guidance and control, aerodynamics, aero heating,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.209
that kind of stuff.

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:51.660
And we were almost doing a configuration a
week when we did that.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:59.910
So, when you look at 53 different configurations
over basically a two-year period, we were

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:08.019
not only just looking at it but we were quantifying
then, what it meant in terms of all the parameters

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:09.959
that I showed you a while ago.

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:10.970
How much did it cost?

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.269
What was the development cost?

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:13.699
What was the operations cost?

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:14.740
What was the weight?

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.649
What was the maximum temperature as we saw
on the vehicle?

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:23.959
Was there a thermal protection system that
could accommodate those types of temperatures?

00:15:23.959 --> 00:15:29.709
That was the characterization in the systems
engineering parameters that we used.

00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:32.120
Tom, where these designs kind of refined?

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.730
Were you refining with each iteration or was
it like we'll try this for a couple iterations

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.910
and then maybe try something completely different?

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.009
Were you working towards a final [OVERLAPPING
VOICES]?

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:44.889
Well, what we were doing was looking at the
variables.

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:50.990
In other words, like here, when we looked
at 53 different things, we looked at payloads

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.420
ranging anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 pounds.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.149
We didn't know what the answer was going to
be.

00:15:57.149 --> 00:16:01.779
The driving thing there was reusability and
cost profile.

00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:04.759
We thought we knew what we could afford to
do.

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:09.720
We looked at payloads from 8 feet in diameter
to 15 feet in diameter, 30 feet long to 75

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.350
feet long.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.570
We were looking at all of those things.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.690
And, as we did that, we changed configuration
from a straight wing, which is not good for

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:23.730
cross-range, to a delta wing which is better
for a cross-range, to a double delta wing

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.540
which is even more structurally efficient.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.579
Landing weights then was important.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:32.990
Just like everybody saw the plane landing
last night, it had to get that landing weight

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.230
down to where it could control it.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.949
Well, that was the same thing we were doing.

00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:43.050
We were looking at landing weights, not only
from a controllability but also from a produceability.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:49.910
We looked at weights from 70,000 to 215,000
pounds, boosters from fully reusable to partially

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.540
reusable, propulsion systems and various types
of things.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.839
We even looked at air breathers so that they
didn't have to come back a dead stick like

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:00.839
they do now when Jeff was in the vehicle.

00:17:00.839 --> 00:17:04.539
And pressure fed and pump fed systems.

00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:07.819
There was simplicity and complications in
all of them.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.049
Tankage, internal or external to the Orbiter.

00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:18.000
Could you maybe say, for people's benefit
here who have grown up in the computer age,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.510
something about the tools that you had?

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.299
I am going to do that in a minute.

00:17:22.299 --> 00:17:23.349
You are, OK.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.939
I'm going to give you a challenge, too.

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:28.039
So, we looked at all of those.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:32.450
And, we not only looked at it, we quantified
it to the extent that we could get the first

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.510
order estimates on what the cost in all those
things where.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.960
Now then, I chose a couple of them here.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.809
This was one of the early designs of the Orbiter.

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:47.169
Look where the locks and hydrogen are.

00:17:47.169 --> 00:17:48.160
It's inside the Orbiter.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:56.280
It has a straight wing so it was fairly lightweight,
except for having to carry all that tankage.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.270
The engines were on the Orbiter itself, but
the payload was really small.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.020
Very low cross-range, very low payload.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.730
So that was probably the 8 foot diameter 40,000
pound payload.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:15.330
We evolved that over a series of studies until
we finally got down to about February of '72

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.360
where we said we're going to have to have
a larger payload than this.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.710
And the cost profile didn't fit.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.880
What we did is we came up with a configuration
that's almost like the shuttle that you see

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.660
today.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.919
Large payload, all the propulsion systems,
the main propulsion systems are outside the

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:32.020
Orbiter.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.690
And it's a fly back, and part of it was throwaway.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:40.179
In this case, we had a booster in line with
the external tank rather than in parallel

00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:42.929
with it like the SRBs are today.

00:18:42.929 --> 00:18:47.830
Basically that's what we started the detailed
design and development with, but not exactly.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:48.380
And I'll show you that.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:57.860
Now then, some of us who like to worry about
load pass and simplicity and low weight of

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.610
the structure, we said ah-ha.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:08.289
What we will do is put the engines on the
external tank.

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:10.070
All the mass is down here.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.970
Very little mass up here.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.990
And for boost reduce the weight of the Orbiter,
which is going to reduce development and operations

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.950
costs a whole bunch and thermal protection
system, but we have to swing these engines

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:31.780
for reusability from the external tank back
up the Orbiter and stow them for entry.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.740
Well, our brother in mechanical engineers,
they beat us pretty hard.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.760
They beat us black and blue.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.140
Anyway, that was a concept that we looked
at very late in the program.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.559
And that didn't go anywhere, even though Max
Faget and I wanted to do it pretty badly.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:51.559
As we continue now.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:56.120
Now we're four years into the thing, we've
done all these systems engineering analysis,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.100
so we end up with a final concept.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.250
Here's what we want.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:06.480
We want a 2.5 stage launch vehicle because
it costs too much basically to fly back the

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.900
booster.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:13.130
We just didn't have the money so we said we
want to have the most important part be fully

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.409
reusable, so that was the Orbiter.

00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:15.780
It was going to be a delta wing.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:24.140
We figured that the mission life, we had a
mission model of 500 total missions, 100 missions

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.460
per vehicle, and there were five vehicles.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.960
We had an ascent acceleration of 3 g's.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.419
Why was that?

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:37.940
Really, the requirement was to keep down the
inertia loads, but it was also to let people

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.390
off the street flying the thing.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.659
Go ahead.

00:20:39.659 --> 00:20:42.169
What constitutes half a stage?

00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:49.260
Half a stage means that the external tank
is like a half a stage.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.770
The SRB is a stage, the engine, the Orbiter
is a stage, but the tank is a half a stage.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:21:07.850
We kept the max dynamic pressure down because
that was a major driver for control systems

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.250
and for aerodynamic services.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.980
You would love not to have the wings on the
Orbiter going uphill.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.070
That's a penalty that you pay.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.919
So, one of the things to help reduce that
is to keep that aerodynamic load down on the

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:21.309
wings.

00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:24.370
Then for atmospheric flights, and I'm going
to talk a little bit more about that, we said

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.260
this thing is going to come back like an airplane.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.059
Let's fly it.

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:32.200
Let's design it like an airplane 2.5 g normal
maneuver load factor and a negative 1 g.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.059
A crew of four for one week.

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:39.830
That becomes kind of important because that
sized the crew module, that sized a lot of

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:45.159
the environmental control systems you'll hear
about later and other things in the life support

00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:46.870
systems.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.669
So, without a lot of changes, to show you
what the flexibility and capability of this

00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:58.840
vehicle is, the Orbiter is now flying seven
people for two weeks.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:06.429
So, it went from 28 man days to 63 man days
basically.

00:22:06.429 --> 00:22:10.539
And I don't think a lot of people understand
what that has done.

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:16.370
And there is a lot more robustness in the
Orbiter, in the shuttle system that was not

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.110
designed into it but had some inherent capability.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.870
And also some of it was a little bit of forethought
in the thing.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.270
Here comes the Air Force stuff.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.020
65,000 pounds up.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.659
40,000 pounds return.

00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:32.120
That was the requirements.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.789
15 x 60.

00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:38.370
Another important thing is we didn't know
what they'd be but maybe up to five payloads

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.030
at a time.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:43.110
And that's going to become a problem, I'll
show you about in a minute, as we start peeling

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:49.830
this systems engineering onion of getting
down into the details.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.020
And deployable payloads.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.020
Cross-range.
A little less than 1300 nautical miles cross-range.

00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:56.960
TPS material.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.100
We didn't know what the hell it was going
to be, but that's what we started with.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:09.929
So, we began the contract for design, development,
test and evaluation.

00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:12.929
NASA does pretty good stuff in-house.

00:23:12.929 --> 00:23:14.970
And I think with Dr.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.820
Mike Griffin at the helm now you're going
to see a lot more of that coming into NASA

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.190
where they're doing a lot of stuff in-house.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:28.049
But when it gets down to doing the detail,
design and manufacturing and cost-control,

00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:32.850
down to the detailed parts and manifesting
everything around, that's where the contract

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:32.940
is.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.460
NASA doesn't have that capability in a large
program.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.000
So, this is where we gave a contract to Rockwell
International.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.220
They had the integration contract.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.090
And another company, Martin, had the external
tank.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.610
[Backhaul?] had the SRBs.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.980
And who else am I missing?

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.860
And Rockwell had the integration and Orbiter
contract, both.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.570
This is what they started with.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:02.580
That was their authority to proceed configuration,
even though this is shown as in 1972.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:08.850
But you see there is very little difference
in the configuration then and what the configuration

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.740
is today.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.390
There was some minor mods which are not worthy
of even talking about right now.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:25.740
But let me give Aaron a lot of credit.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.419
His favorite word, the whole time he was the
project manager, was no.

00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:37.580
And he had above his blackboard better is
the enemy of good.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.409
We've got something.

00:24:38.409 --> 00:24:39.460
We know it will work.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.570
We knew that damn configuration would work.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:47.250
And Aaron got inundated with people coming
back after we started the program.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:55.590
Aaron, if you put reaction control jets out
on the wing tips and here and up on the vertical

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.720
stabilizer you get a lot more control authority.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.279
And when you guys start looking at this guidance
and control stuff in propulsion you're going

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.549
to come up with that.

00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:07.900
But it complicated the entry in the thermal
protection system.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.900
It complicated getting the fuel to those things,
so Aaron said no, no, no.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.870
And the astronauts would come in.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.029
They'll always meet with Aaron at 7:00 in
the morning because that's when they would

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:20.350
get their word in.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.159
And so they would have to go do flight training
or something like that.

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:26.110
And, as they walked out the door, Aaron would
say no.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.220
They didn't hear him, but it was always no.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.000
And that was critical in this thing.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.760
And so the program came in at $5.1 billion.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.510
It started $5.1 billion.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.210
It came in at $5.1 billion.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.039
It was only because of being able to say no.

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:48.020
But to say no you better do a good systems
engineering job at the beginning.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.799
And were there some faults and errors?

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:50.010
Yeah.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:57.179
I'll confess and open my kimono here on the
few of the things, but all in all it wasn't

00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:58.730
too bad.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:05.549
And I will say one other thing about systems
engineering.

00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:12.460
It was interesting to watch four or five different
large companies look at the various concepts.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:18.600
I can say this now because none of these companies
even exist in the form that they were then.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.020
Grumman had a very large systems engineering
organization.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:29.929
Rockwell had a very small systems engineering
organization, almost down to one or two people,

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:32.330
but they were extremely good.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.870
They were extremely good systems engineers.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:45.520
NASA went with Rockwell for a number of reasons,
but one of the things that probably benefited

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:52.350
the program was having a very concentrated
set of engineering requirements coming out

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.130
of a systems engineer which almost turned
out to be one guy, Ed Smith.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.039
And he was very, very good at that.

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:05.539
The reason I bring that up to you, the thing
that's most defficient, from my perspective

00:27:05.539 --> 00:27:11.120
now in the United States today, are good systems
engineers.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.640
Very good thermal engineers, good structural
engineers, good propulsion engineers.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.240
There are very few systems engineers that
are good.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:27.169
If you make a note of that and become one
of those, you'd be highly sought after.

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:29.690
So, a little bit of this is a repeat.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:38.390
As we went into these requirements, and from
a government system's perspective, now the

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:44.169
challenge was to give the contractor the requirements
that they need but don't over-specify the

00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:45.470
requirements.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:51.500
We were very careful to say here are the top
level requirements, don't ask us what the

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.270
internal loads on the wing are because we're
not going to tell you what that is.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.510
That is for you to decide.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.750
And, if you want to change something within
these constraints, you can change it.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:05.809
But the burden is on you to make everything
else right.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:11.840
That is something that I think the Orbiter
did probably better than the external tank.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.779
I'll just say it like it is.

00:28:14.779 --> 00:28:15.360
Go ahead.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:21.059
I'm just wondering, sir, what happened to
the canard configuration with the delta wing?

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:22.809
What happened to it?

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:22.970
Yeah.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.059
It was not selected.

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:28.720
And I don't remember why it was not selected.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.880
What was driving it, I don't know.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.990
I don't have those notes anymore.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.419
It could have been cross-range.

00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:44.840
I don't remember that particular configuration,
if it had the required cross-range for the

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.580
payload mass.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.100
I just don't remember.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.590
I don't think it would have been cost.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:53.710
I think it was a lot of complexity.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.990
Well, it did have complexity so it had to
add some cost.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:02.640
Weight-wise, it probably was not too different
just because of the control authority of having

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.559
the canards there.

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:04.399
But that's a good question.

00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:11.330
Tom, you might mention [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.159
I'm going to touch on that, again, a little
bit in a minute about what we did in surveying

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:16.610
and determining the loads.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:23.770
And let me hold that if I can.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:28.210
Now we have begun with the design..

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:45.909
When you use the term top level requirements,
what does the top level refer to as opposed

00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:53.679
to just requirements or performance requirements?

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:58.080
Well, the top level requirement changes as
the phase changes.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.039
The very beginning, in '68, the top level
requirement was a transportation system.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:07.970
We don't know what it's going to be, reusable,
and we don't know how much payload it is going

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:08.970
to have to carry.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.820
So, that was the top level requirement.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:18.169
Then it was to look at all of the combinations
of things that you could create.

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:23.760
The solution was it is feasible and we think
that this is about what it's going to cost.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.130
Now, as we get into this point, these are
the top level requirements.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:35.690
So, the granularity of the requirements increases
as the program advances.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:44.270
Good question..

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:49.279
For the challenges, now I'm going to call
it the challenges of beginning this thing,

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:53.539
we know what the configuration is, you know
what the design life is, et cetera, all that

00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:59.570
kind of stuff, but we still haven't decided
on what the material of the airframe is going

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.169
to be.

00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:04.330
We estimated some stuff because it could be
aluminum or it could be titanium and this

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.120
is what it would be.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.460
And it all fits within the right cost and
performance envelopes, but let's optimize

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.950
that from a systems standpoint a little bit
and see what that is.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.980
Some of the challenges in structural design,
and I'm going to talk about each one of these

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.269
things that's listed on here separately, should
the cabin be an integral part of the fuselage

00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:27.659
or should it be a pressure vessel floating
within the fuselage?

00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:28.779
Trade to be made.

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:31.070
How are we going to account for thermal stress
in this?

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.840
Well, what the hell is thermal stress?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.620
Apollo, we didn't care a whole lot about thermal
stress.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.899
It really wasn't an issue, not to the extent
that a vehicle like this is.

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.399
It was very sensitive for thermal stress.

00:31:43.399 --> 00:31:44.279
Compartment venting.

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:47.080
We'll talk more about that.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.929
Major structure concept trades to reduce weight
basically.

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:56.919
And then how in the hell do we get the design
loads on this thing?

00:31:56.919 --> 00:32:03.210
From a structural design criteria we said,
well, let's start with 1.5.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.970
That's what all airplanes are designed for
so we'll do that.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.000
Even though some of the boosters were designed
for 1.25.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.580
Does everybody know what an ultimate factor
safety is?

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:20.299
That's the allowable of the material that
you've decided to use compared to the maximum

00:32:20.299 --> 00:32:24.019
expected load that you will ever want to see,
three sigma kind of loads.

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:28.970
And then whatever the factor is about that,
that's the factor of safety.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:34.899
So, you simply take the maximum loads you
can expect to find, multiply it by 1.4 and

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:36.659
it better meet what the allowable is.

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:40.950
If there's margin in that allowable then that's
called a design margin.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.320
Ideally, you would like to have zero margin.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.269
That still gives you a 40% factor of safety.

00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:50.600
Everybody with me?

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.370
Yield is classically something that you decided
on material.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.700
Well, I want to also have a factor safety
on yield.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.250
And we sat around and asked ourselves why
the hell do we care about that?

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:06.510
The only thing you don't want it to do is
you don't want it to deform such that it won't

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.010
operate so doors won't open, hinges won't
work, et cetera.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:17.669
We did not impose that on the program of the
yield factor safety.

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:19.480
We didn't on the Orbiter.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.880
The external tank did.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.390
And they paid a weight for that because if
you put a 1.2 factor safety on yield for some

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:31.590
materials, that gives you a lower allowable
than an ultimate factor safety when you're

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:36.710
really only interested in ultimate strength.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:41.990
And then we had said thermal stress is going
to be important, but we don't want to be so

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:48.289
conservative that we let the thermal stress
add in such a way that it adds conservatism.

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:53.980
But, at the same time, we don't want it to
count on it if it's relieving when we cannot

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.090
really rely on it to be there.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:00.779
So, it is decreasing from the stress point
of view.

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:04.909
A scatter factor of four on life for a hundred
missions.

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:07.309
What is scatter factor?

00:34:07.309 --> 00:34:09.629
Scatter factor just means a factor of four.

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:18.260
If you have 10,000 cycles at 20,000 psi stress
then you have to certify it for 40,000 cycles.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:27.969
Typically, most airplanes you fly around on,
they have a design life of about 20,000 flight

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:28.449
hours.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:29.750
I think that's about right.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:37.668
They are fatigue tested to 80,000 flight hours
to make sure that they have that kind of factor

00:34:37.668 --> 00:34:39.300
on life.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.310
And then we said well, this thing is going
to be used a lot, we've never looked at that

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:47.859
before so we will arbitrarily say we'll use
a 1.2 factor at the end of life or ultimate.

00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:54.168
And then these are just classical engineering
material allowables that everybody uses today.

00:34:54.168 --> 00:35:07.630
A lot of people have mentioned lately, as
we were thinking of the end of the life of

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:11.780
the shuttle, that although it was designed
for a hundred missions, I guess it was always

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.839
assumed that those hundred missions would
be flown over the course of just a few years.

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:20.859
And so, I think it's true, you more concerned
with the long-term effects of stress than

00:35:20.859 --> 00:35:27.089
things like weathering or being exposed to
salt, air over 20 years.

00:35:27.089 --> 00:35:30.210
Is that correct?

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.280
Well, you hit a very key point.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.550
And you're exactly right.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:38.140
It turns out a hundred missions wasn't really
designing anything.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.960
I mean it could have.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.260
Well, as a matter of fact, it didn't.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.490
I don't know of anything.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:48.710
A hundred missions design is for a cyclic
stress, high cycle, low stress fatigue or

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.310
low cycle high stress.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.430
It didn't.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:58.300
But the environment sitting around or the
life of the material exposed has.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.650
The leading edge turned out to be there is
a degradation in the strength of the leading

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:09.570
edge material, the carbon-carbon material
because of being exposed to the conditions.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.420
There was some corrosion found in the wings
during an inspection.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.970
Nothing was wrong with the low carrying capability,
except it was beginning to corrode.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:27.810
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] You've got me mixed
up with somebody else.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.560
I'm not talking about avionics.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.339
[LAUGHTER] No, but it's true.

00:36:33.339 --> 00:36:39.270
There, I think, just to bring that up, the
idea was they would not be good for that length

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.250
of time so change them out, we're going to
have to upgrade them anyway.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:52.160
Aaron, I think, just left being program manager
when they decided to change,no you still were

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.170
there, they decided to change the general-purpose
computers.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.940
It took ten years to change the general-purpose
computers because of all the certification.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.920
Did the use and safety factors, like what
numbers you were using, how much did the Apollo

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.010
program [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] aircraft safety
factors?

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:21.880
The Apollo program was like 1.2 factor of
safety, as I recall, because it was a single

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.490
use item.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:30.940
And I'm going to take the opportunity to go
back and verify that, but I think that's was

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.089
right for some conditions.

00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:35.070
And it could have been 1.5 on others.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:41.680
I know on pressure alone it was 1.5 psi.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.170
You say, well, why was it different for pressure
than it was for others?

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.839
Because there was some historical data there
that NASA had that said that was the right

00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:50.920
thing to use.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.790
But that's a good question.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.460
Now you've caught me.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:38:01.400
I can remember on the boosters it was 1.25,
but on the command module itself, let me retract

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.980
that, it was probably 1.5.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:18.170
It was 1.25 on the boosters and 1.5 on the
crude part of the vehicle.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:23.740
One of the challenges that we had here was
to establish a criteria.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.579
These were our objectives.

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:30.770
To assure that there was a realistic stress
that we're putting in the vehicle and we weren't

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:32.770
being overly conservative with it.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.630
We were not reducing the stress because of
thermal gradients.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.960
And then we were incorporating the classical
pressure induced stress.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.060
And now what were the details of that?

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.430
Here were the details.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:53.740
We came up with this algorithm that says we
will use a factor of 1.4 on all external loads

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.270
because that's aerodynamic loads, inertia
loads and so forth.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:04.119
We will use a factor of 1.4 on the thermally
induced loads, if you will.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:06.010
They are really thermally induced strains
and stress.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:12.329
We'll use a 1.4 factor on that if it's additive
to the mechanical, but if it's subtractive

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:16.990
we'll only use one because we probably won't
reach the maximum thermal conditions so you

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.720
cannot rely on that.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.430
On pressure, we used 1.4.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.270
Unless it was pressure alone, we used 1.5.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:31.599
But the whole thing is we would never have
less than 1.4 of the total combined load.

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:33.450
So, that's what we did.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.520
And so you say why in the hell did you do
that?

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.500
Why did you have to go to that kind of detail?

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.970
The reason being is because you probably had
about 30,000 stress engineers working on the

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.500
program, and they needed to know how to combine
this stuff.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.040
If you didn't, this guy is going to do one
thing and this guy is going to do something

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.200
different.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.380
We got it down to that level to save weight
in the vehicle and save complexity in the

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.450
vehicle.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:03.000
Well, we have our criteria set now.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.940
Let me give one more story on marginal safety.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:12.050
One of the people that I showed you at the
top of the credits list was John Yardley.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:19.490
And probably Aaron and Larry Young and other
people would probably agree with this, John

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:23.349
Yardley is probably the best engineer that
I ever knew in my entire life.

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:28.329
He's probably one of the best managers I ever
knew.

00:40:28.329 --> 00:40:35.210
John Yardley had the job of being the Program
Manager on McDonnell Douglas F4 aircraft.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.130
And he was an old stress guy.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:43.089
He knew that weight was going to be a critical
parameter in the success of that program and

00:40:43.089 --> 00:40:46.420
he had to keep the weight out.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.670
What he did, on that previous slide where
I showed you the stress criteria and make

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:55.150
sure that you have a zero margin of safety
with a factor of 1.4, is he told all the stress

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:59.060
engineers, because they all worked for him,
design to a negative 10%.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.410
Which means if you really do your job right
this thing is not going to be able to reach

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.930
ultimate load.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.760
It's going to break.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.140
But he also knew that they were probably conservative
because he was one of those guys.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:16.160
And he also had in his hip pocket, if he's
wrong he would find out because he had the

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.410
opportunity to do an ultimate load test on
the airframe.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.810
It turns out he did the ultimate load test,
it passed the ultimate load capability and

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:30.859
he saved a bunch of weight in airplane which
made it a very successful airplane.

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:38.119
Sometimes from a systems perspective, it's
what you learn in the details or in the trenches

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:43.079
as you're coming up and being able to apply
it the same way that Aaron did a lot of stuff

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.280
as he was managing the program.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:53.160
On the airframe we looked at a lot of different
structural materials, we looked at a lot of

00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:00.640
different TPS materials, and some of the parameters
that were coming out in there was not only

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.390
strength of the material but how much heat
sink there was because you were having to

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.460
rely on that to keep the weights down.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:10.579
And let me go up one slide and show you something
here.

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:20.030
I don't know if you can read that, but on
the left side what it was is it was all aluminum

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.599
airframe.

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:23.700
It had an ablator thermal protection system
on it.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.650
And you said, well, I thought you said it
was going to be fully reusable.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.160
Well, we also had a cost constraint.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.430
So we put that in there as a reference point.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.800
And that was the lowest cost.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.099
And here's weight up here.

00:42:36.099 --> 00:42:43.119
It wasn't quite the lowest weight, it was
pretty low, but it still was violating the

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:44.310
objectives and requirements that we had.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.369
And we said that will be our reference point.

00:42:46.369 --> 00:42:48.589
Then we looked at different types of aluminum.

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:49.790
We looked a beryllium.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:50.960
We looked at titanium.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:56.410
We looked at the thermal protection system
on a beryllium substrate.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.480
Every kind of combination you could think
of.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.640
The interesting thing was, look where the
whites were staying.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:09.819
They were all staying within the 60,000 to
80,000 pound total weight envelope.

00:43:09.819 --> 00:43:15.420
What was happening is we were decreasing the
thermal protection system thickness.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:20.339
If we were using titanium, which we could
operate to 600 degrees, the TPS weight was

00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:20.839
going down.

00:43:20.839 --> 00:43:30.140
Titanium was not as good a heat sink as aluminum,
even though we're working it to a higher temperature.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:38.670
And it turned out that the combination of
TPS plus structure was pretty much a constant.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.869
I'm oversimplifying it, but that's basically
what it was.

00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:44.579
And you can see where the cost was.

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:49.000
This is beryllium titanium.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.369
The cost was way out of whack compared to
everything else, so we said we're not going

00:43:54.369 --> 00:43:55.890
to do that.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.300
And there were some other exotic materials
over here for hot structures.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.359
We said let's now decide what this airframe
material is going to be.

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:06.920
It's going to either be aluminum or titanium.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:14.290
And total weight, total cost doesn't make
any difference, they're about the same.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.390
We weren't' smart enough to decide so we went
out to the skunk works.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:22.319
Kelly Johnson skunk works, I don't know if
you know what that means.

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:29.030
Kelly Johnson designed and built more airplanes
in a short period of time.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:37.710
And they were the ones, Larry, was it in the
`50s, the SR-71 was designed, the Black Bird?

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:48.210
I think it was in the 1950s.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.170
It was somewhere in there.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.010
They had to develop titanium for that airplane.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.470
It was a hot structure design.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.740
We went out and spent some time with Kelly
Johnson.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.760
We went through all this stuff with him.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.710
All right, Mr.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:04.260
Johnson, at the end of the day it's a mix
for us.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.170
Would you build it out of aluminum or titanium?

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.210
He said aluminum.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:15.790
And the reason being is because titanium was
so difficult to work to produce.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.490
The manufacturing was difficult.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.180
Today it's a lot less difficult than it was
then.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:25.990
We made the decision and went with aluminum,
so we had to protect that structure to 350

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.150
degrees.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:33.720
That was a lot of work and a lot of analysis
to make that decision.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:39.520
And we talked to Aaron and said that's what
we want to do, and he said go for it.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.319
The next thing we looked at, we got the airframe
design, now we're starting to put together

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:48.180
the fuselage.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:54.280
We said we can put this crew cabin as part
of an integral part of the fuselage or we

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.490
can make it a separate pressure vessel inside.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.260
Went through the trades on this.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.880
And we came up with some of the discrete advantages.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.560
It's a purely simple pressure vessel when
you don't have any inertia loads, except the

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.700
mass that is inside the crew module itself.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:18.650
There is a discrete attachment between the
crew module and the forward fuselage which

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:24.180
means you could start the design and construction
of these two things in parallel.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.540
And simple interfaces are important.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.970
Somebody mentioned modularity, and it's probably
modularity in some analytical tools.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:39.380
But simple interfaces where you're putting
things together are extremely important.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.790
So, this created a very simple interface for
us.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:45.109
Also, we didn't have a lot of heat transfer
to the crew module.

00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:49.099
It was easy to control the environment within
the crew module.

00:46:49.099 --> 00:46:56.380
And we designed it out of a material, a 2219
aluminum, which had an inherent advantage

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:03.020
of if it gets a crack, the crack doesn't grow
catastrophically under the operating stress

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.750
before it starts leaking a lot.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:11.450
Well, that's good because, from a crew safety
standpoint, you know that if the seals are

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:15.720
working and it's still leaking you've got
a crack in that pressure vessel but it's not

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:23.560
going to be a crack that is going to propagate
to be a catastrophic failure.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.970
We chose the floating design.

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:33.400
When I talked a while ago about the crew of
seven in two weeks now compared to four for

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:41.020
seven days, back in '72 we said we don't know
what the requirements are going to be, but

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:47.069
let's make this thing as robust as we can
without penalizing ourselves weight-wise.

00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:52.849
So, we went back to Apollo and said what were
all the densities in the Command Module for

00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:53.460
the Crew Module?

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.430
We figured out a density and a volume.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.190
We said that will be our baseline.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:59.930
That's what we came up with.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:07.200
Well, for another 50 pounds of weight, we
could increase the carrying capability of

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.190
the crew module by about 500 pounds.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:13.380
That was a good trade at that time so we did
it.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.069
We just said we're going to design this thing.

00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:22.540
Instead of for 25,000 pounds we'll design
it for 30,000 pounds of payload carrying capability

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.619
within the crew module.

00:48:23.619 --> 00:48:26.020
It turned out to be a good decision.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:31.760
We weren't smart enough to know operationally
we'll need larger crews for a longer period

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.030
of time, but that helped us out a lot.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:46.319
You probably also want to mention, when you
look at the structure of the crew cabin, in

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:58.180
both of the shuttle disasters, the Challenger
and Columbia, we have every indication that

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.430
the crew cabin actually survived the breakup
of the Orbiter.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:01.069
So, it really was an excellent structure.

00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.069
I'm glad you brought that up.
As a matter of fact, I have a note here to
bring it up myself.

00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:11.550
Jeff is exactly right that that's what it
did, but it was never designed to be a crew

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.900
escape module.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:20.760
It had some inherent capabilities, probably
could survive some things that it couldn't

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:26.099
had it been part of the fuselage, different
flight regime, so it had that inherent capability.

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:36.190
But it was never designed -- And I know there
was a lot of talk after Challenger that it

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:41.050
looked like it would have survived all the
way, but it would have never made it all the

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:41.050
way.
But it would have under a lot of conditions.

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:53.630
We said Apollo didn't have a lot of thermal
stress issues, but we know this vehicle now

00:49:53.630 --> 00:50:02.280
we've skinnied down weight-wise as much as
we can to the extent that the thermal gradients

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:07.520
between any two different pieces of structure,
where they were different materials or different

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.359
masses is going to cause a thermal gradient.

00:50:10.359 --> 00:50:13.329
And thermal gradient cause thermal stresses.

00:50:13.329 --> 00:50:16.740
And you will see in a minute that was not
only important to stress but is important

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.640
to all these tiles we were sticking on the
outside of this thing.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.200
So we said we have to look at every one of
these thermal gradients and we have to understand

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.220
what that induced stress is because we had
an indication it was going to probably contribute

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.390
about 30% of the total stress in the vehicle.

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.410
It was going to be from thermal stressors
at different flight regimes.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:42.000
Kelly Johnson helped us out pretty well deciding
on aluminum and titanium.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.420
We said why don't we just fix this thing?

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.160
We'll design around all the thermal stress.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.770
We'll put stress relief in it, like expansion
joints along the sidewalk.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.780
We'll do all these kinds of cute things and
we'll simplify the heck out of this.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:03.450
As a matter of fact, the SR-71, the Black
Bird, it had huge thermal stress problems.

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:09.890
So the wing on an SR-71, normally the skin
carries a lot of the wing bending.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.920
Not true on an SR-71.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.490
It's corrugated skin so it can expand and
contract.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:21.490
All the wing bending is carried in the spar
caps, the frames that go out the entire wing,

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.210
and the caps themselves.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.849
They paid a penalty but avoided the thermal
stress issue.

00:51:26.849 --> 00:51:28.420
We said we'll be smart with that.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.190
We'll go talk to the SR-71 guys.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.319
And we'll go talk to the Concorde.

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:37.380
The Concorde was an airplane that had high
thermal stress, even though it wasn't that

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.809
high a temperature.

00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:44.800
I think it was reaching 500 or 600 degrees
outside, but it was moving fuel around all

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.700
over the vehicle.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:50.569
So when it moved this high mass of fuel from
one part of the vehicle to the other, it was

00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:51.790
creating big thermal stresses.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.329
They knew what to do.

00:51:54.329 --> 00:51:59.660
They designed in stress relief at these high
points.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.540
It bit them.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.309
Every time they did it they had fatigue failures.

00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:04.250
Every time they did that.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.490
They finally gave up and said just accommodate.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:09.849
We said we'll do that.

00:52:09.849 --> 00:52:13.490
Now then, we decided on that criteria.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.730
We're going to account for thermal stress,
but how can we do it?

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:24.730
We don't have a 3D model that we can apply
mechanical loads to, I'll call aero loads

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:27.520
mechanical loads, and temperature distribution.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.119
The finite element model didn't exist.

00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:34.349
We had a finite element model that had 50,000
degrees of freedom, but we didn't have a computing

00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:38.730
capability to combine thermal and mechanical
loads on there at the same time to be able

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:40.970
to decide how to size the structure.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.300
We said now we've got a problem.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.450
What the hell are we going to do about that?

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:57.559
What we did is looked at what were the conditions
causing the thermal stress?

00:52:57.559 --> 00:52:59.440
Going uphill thermal stress is not an issue.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.410
It's all coming back in, in the entry phase.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:08.089
We knew we had initial conditions that were
going to primarily be the cause of it.

00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:12.030
Coming back where the vehicle had been sitting
in top sun for a long time, bottom sun for

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:17.569
a long time, side sun for a long time, so
we looked at those initial conditions as being

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.980
the worse.

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.670
And we proved to ourselves that it was the
worst.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:27.650
Then what we cleverly did is we went around
the vehicle where we had a detailed structural

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:28.890
model of a lot of stuff.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:35.790
And we created a hundred different thermal
models of different types of structure.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.500
This is one that was in the wing truss.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.450
We had a wing skin panel, we had a truss member
and a lower wing skin panel.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.630
And we did a detailed thermal analysis of
these hundred models.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:54.589
We then applied that to a structural model
simplified, which was giving us the internal

00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:59.470
loads and stresses that we needed, and then
we hand extrapolated that over the entire

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:01.990
vehicle.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:03.230
There was no other way to do it.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:10.069
So, as you look at your analytical capability
probably on your damn laptop now, computing

00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:15.369
capability, you couldn't really do it on that,
but think about that.

00:54:15.369 --> 00:54:19.440
And I noticed nobody wants to talk about structures
as one of these groups.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.339
If one of you changes then I'm going to feel
really good when I go back and fight the hurricane

00:54:24.339 --> 00:54:27.119
in Texas.

00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:29.780
But that's the way we did that.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:35.809
It was a necessity that we had, but we didn't
have the capability so we invented a way to

00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:36.869
do it.

00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:41.210
And, I'll show you in a minute, it worked.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.869
Another issue that we had.

00:54:43.869 --> 00:54:48.369
Normally you'd like to just vent everything
through one area in the vehicle, but we couldn't

00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:51.869
do that because the payload bay had to be
very clean.

00:54:51.869 --> 00:54:53.960
It had to be contamination free.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.140
And there was hydrogen in the backend of the
vehicle.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:01.500
There was a pressure vessel in the front-end
and a bulkhead up there.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:07.299
We said what we've got to do is we have dictated
to ourselves that we have to design a venting

00:55:07.299 --> 00:55:08.190
system.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.970
This turned out to be a major part of a lot
of internal loads in the vehicle because of

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.960
venting from one compartment to the other.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.130
And, stop and think about it, we had vents
all along the fuselage.

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:23.180
We had a different pressure coefficient at
each one of these vents for our various attitudes

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:29.319
during ascent, for our various attitudes during
entry, so we now had a whole myriad of complicated

00:55:29.319 --> 00:55:31.730
internal pressures that we had to accommodate.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.640
But that was pretty straightforward.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:39.059
We just complicated our design with the venting
system that we had, but we had to do it to

00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:39.839
meet the requirement.

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:41.230
I don't know that people are actually aware
that there are all these vent doors because

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:48.760
it's not something that you would normally
pay attention to in the pictures.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.549
That's right, you don't.

00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:56.210
As a matter of fact, in this book that Jeff
referenced, it shows where all the vent doors

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.770
are.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.280
I didn't show that detail to you today.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:11.880
And they do open and close at different times
during ascent and entry.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.520
Venting just for carbon dioxide gases?

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:12.619
No.

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:13.619
When you start off you're at one atmosphere,
right?

00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:23.020
As you rapidly go uphill there's a delta p
across internal bulkheads and internal compartments,

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.760
internal and outside the vehicle.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.710
And, depending on what the flight regime is
and where the shockwave is and where the vent

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:33.750
door is, it's changing the whole venting thing.

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.329
That's a whole lecture in itself on what we
did.

00:56:36.329 --> 00:56:44.609
The crew compartment is designed to have a
delta pressure of one atmosphere, but inside

00:56:44.609 --> 00:56:48.540
the payload bay, that's not designed to be
a pressurized environment.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:56.490
And so you need to be sure that the air can
get out of the payload bay fast enough that

00:56:56.490 --> 00:57:06.520
you don't over-pressurize, for instance, the
payload bay doors or other parts of the structure.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.530
There were some other trades that we had to
make.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.210
Let me skip forward so you can better understand
this.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:24.859
For reference purposes, the main engines are
here, 1.5 million pounds of thrust coming

00:57:24.859 --> 00:57:27.440
into this part of the vehicle.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.290
There is a Longeron that goes all the way
along here.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.329
A big mass up here with a crew module.

00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:37.210
And the crew module, I showed you, had just
discrete attachment points.

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:43.910
All of the ascent inertia loads are reacted
right here, so all these loads go along this

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:44.730
Longeron.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:52.290
Now, all of a sudden we have a very good and
efficient load path.

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:56.270
The wing right here, this is a primary load
carrying member of the wing.

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:57.660
That's a spar.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:01.390
And it ties into this big bulkhead which is
right here.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:12.640
When Jeff talks about the pressure differential,
don't forget this thing is 15 feet in diameter

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.540
here so you can imagine the total loads you
have on that with a couple of psi delta p.

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.349
It's big.

00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:24.329
That was a significant part of the driving
stresses in that.

00:58:24.329 --> 00:58:30.619
Another point I want to make about this is
-- Well, I talked about simple interfaces

00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:39.030
between the crew module and the forward fuselage
with bolted attachments.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:43.299
We had a simple interface between the wing
and the mid fuselage.

00:58:43.299 --> 00:58:47.380
A simple interface between the mid fuselage
and the aft fuselage.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:52.559
The same thing with the vertical stabilizer
and aft fuselage and these orbital maneuvering

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:55.260
propulsion system.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:01.750
That was important, from a structural point
of view, to be able to modularize and analyze

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:02.160
these things.

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.790
But it was also important because four different
contractors built all these parts so they

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:13.180
had to have an interface that they could not
only design and analyze to but that they could

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:16.549
physically attach to.

00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:21.450
Sometimes, when you have just a sketch on
a piece of paper, you don't think about that.

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:30.150
And it does cause a little bit of complexity
sometimes in a program.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:34.530
The main thrust structure is carrying 1.5
million pounds of load from the engines.

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:35.450
How do we design that?

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:39.819
Well, we could have done a space frame or
we could have done a truss configuration.

00:59:39.819 --> 00:59:45.670
We decided to go with the space frame or the
truss rather than a plate girder, the term

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:48.030
I didn't use correctly.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.980
And with that we saved 1700 pounds of weight
in the vehicle.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.780
We used titanium.

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:58.240
And this is a compression design.

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.099
We thought we needed to get a little bit more
weight out of this thing.

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:04.970
What can we do to increase the compression
modulus of titanium?

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:14.540
We put boron/epoxy, scabbed it on the axial
load members of the thrust structure, and

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:18.030
that's the way we got a lot of that weight
out.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:23.170
That was a manufacturing problem, I won't
go into now, of how you build this thrust

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:28.640
structure, but it works fine.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.170
The aft wing carried through -- Excuse me.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:31.869
Go ahead.

01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:32.150
I just had a quick question.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.200
Sure.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:39.680
We heard earlier that there was a CG problem
in that the CG was too far forward in the

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.819
aft [but bled in the back?] for a number a
number of missions.

01:00:43.819 --> 01:00:46.619
I was wondering how that weight that they
had to add to the CG compared to the weight

01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:48.299
that you guys saved.

01:00:48.299 --> 01:00:52.280
The weight of the payloads themselves, you're
saying that there was a problem if heavy weights

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.130
were too far aft or too far forward?

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:55.640
The Orbiter.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.490
I guess the CG location was too far forward
and they had to adjust it on certain missions

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.990
by adding weight near the back.

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:10.109
Well, what that is, that is true and that's
a problem.

01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:11.240
It's not a problem.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.240
It's something that has to be addressed on
every mission, depending on what the payload

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.089
is that you're carrying.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:22.240
If you have a real heavy forward payload,
yeah, you have to add some ballast to the

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.210
aft end of the thing.

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.270
Now, normally the way they do it is they'll
find some payload that can fit in the aft

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.240
end to help ballast that.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.079
But I think, in some of the early flights,
we put some ballast in the back for CG control.

01:01:33.079 --> 01:01:42.700
We've carried many tons of lead into orbit,
so it was ballasting the thing for control

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.099
purposes.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:49.900
The same way yesterday in Jet Blue, a lot
of people had to move to the back end of the

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:57.720
airplane because they wanted that CG for a
little bit different landing performance.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.750
1307 bulkhead, we saved about 500 pounds there.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.890
Now, see what we're doing?

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:07.440
We started out with the initial trades in
the early concept phases.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.329
What's the wing loading?

01:02:09.329 --> 01:02:13.799
We didn't care about what the internal structure
trades were.

01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:20.660
Now we're getting down to trading all the
stuff at a semi-macro level.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.280
And I'll show you in a minute a micro-level
that we had to get into, which was pretty

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.230
interesting.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:27.680
How are we doing time-wise?

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.380
We're OK.

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.660
So, we saved some weight there.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:37.730
An interesting thing about the payload bay
doors.

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:49.270
We decided that for this vehicle to be safe
and to re-enter those doors had to close.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:54.640
We had a lot of trouble in Gemini with things
on orbit not working.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.839
Mechanical systems quite often are problems.

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:59.859
Docking systems are problems.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:04.400
There have been a lot of door problems on
orbit in spacecraft.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.839
And you design them and you put them in thermal
vacuum chambers and they all work, but you

01:03:07.839 --> 01:03:09.960
get on orbit and sometimes they don't work.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.220
Maybe it's thermal distortion that we're not
accounting for.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.980
So, we said that is critical.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.859
We've got to close these payload bay doors.

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:23.510
What we did was say the way we're going to
do that is the payload doors will carry only

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:24.450
two types of load.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:32.059
They will carry pressure loads, like Jeff
talked about, and they'll carry torsion loads.

01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:37.799
Because, if they are closed, we know that
it is good for torsion in the vehicle, reacting

01:03:37.799 --> 01:03:39.359
torsional loads.

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:44.160
But we will not let them carry body bending
loads or else we cannot make them flexible

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:44.500
enough.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:52.940
What we did is all of the body bending in
this vehicle is carried along this Longeron

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.150
through this section in the lower skin of
the vehicle.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:04:01.309
This is the modulus of the vehicle, if you
will, at a cross-section here between this

01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:03.280
Longeron and the lower skin.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.160
Payload bay doors don't come into being.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:13.410
And the way the doors close on orbit is they
start zipping along from here up to the top

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:14.970
because they are flexible.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:21.240
And the same way back here, they zip closed,
zipping just a latch at a time.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.720
They were sort of ratcheting themselves closed.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.700
And then they close along the center line.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:30.869
There has never been a problem with payload
bay door closures on orbit.

01:04:30.869 --> 01:04:34.730
It was something we decided to add to the
design.

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:40.559
We could have made the vehicle lighter had
we not done that, but we would have also complicated

01:04:40.559 --> 01:04:46.930
the safety of the vehicle if we had done it.

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:54.859
Sort of in line, but it's not the CG thing,
we had a payload attachment issue.

01:04:54.859 --> 01:05:03.849
And, when we were laying out all this stuff
in the early `70s, we didn't know what the

01:05:03.849 --> 01:05:04.349
payloads were.

01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:06.910
We knew what the total mass was.

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:09.599
We knew there may be five at a time.

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:11.180
We didn't know what they were.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:17.609
Now, you can just go in and bolt a payload
into the fuselage of the Orbiter.

01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:22.849
And if you just do that randomly or without
thinking about it, now all of a sudden you

01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:27.109
start analyzing the Orbiter and you start
twisting it, what happens?

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:29.410
The payload becomes part of the load path.

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:34.349
Now, all of a sudden, you have impacted the
design of the payload or maybe you have impacted

01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:37.400
the design of the Orbiter depending on what
is happening in the payload.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.849
We said ah-ha, what we'll do is make it so
it's statically determinant.

01:05:41.849 --> 01:05:48.150
If two things are attached statically determinately
they cannot interact with one another as far

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.910
as their stiffnesses are concerned.

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:52.440
We said that's what we're going to do.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.369
We'll put attachments along the Longerons
to carry the axial loads, some along the keel

01:05:58.369 --> 01:05:59.920
to carry some of the lateral loads.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.569
Viola, we've got it.

01:06:01.569 --> 01:06:05.849
So, the requirement became that we would design
it that way.

01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:11.788
Our next step was, and you can ask Al Louviere
when he comes up about that because Al Louviere

01:06:11.788 --> 01:06:17.410
and Max Faget told me they would never fly
with those Longerons that way.

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:20.319
We did it anyway.

01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:24.029
What we had to do then was say now we understand
what the attachment is.

01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:30.920
How do we determine within the CG constraints
for these different masses -- And we had to

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.220
assume what they were not knowing exactly
the definition of the payloads.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.809
We did a Monte Carlo analysis.

01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:40.730
Ten million cases of combined payloads.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:44.510
CG locations, numbers of payloads, forward,
aft, all that.

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:46.319
And we did that with a Monte Carlo analysis.

01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:48.970
We said voila, that's where we're going to
design the mid fuselage.

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:55.609
That's the way we did it.

01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:58.940
Now getting into the detail design loads.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.680
How do we determine all these things now?

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.788
Because now it's coming down to sizing the
vehicle.

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:15.950
This part of the flight regime from liftoff
through max Q, that's a critical loading condition,

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:18.510
a critical design for the Orbiter.

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:21.809
When it gets into orbit pretty benign.

01:07:21.809 --> 01:07:26.799
Nothing is really happening up there except
some temperatures which are going to be important

01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:32.029
at this point over here, because now all of
a sudden you start adding more heat into it.

01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:36.950
Now you get into the regime where you're maneuvering
in the atmosphere.

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:41.520
Now you're in a different loading regime which
becomes critical.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:48.640
So, critical as far as the airframe is concerned,
is here and over here only.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.799
Let me break that down into the constituent
portions there.

01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:54.440
Liftoff loads.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:00.500
We had another statistical challenge here
because what we had to do was needed to look

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:04.270
at all the variables associated with the rocket
engines.

01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:05.520
They have start sequences.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.869
We've got three main engines that are not
going to start exactly the same time.

01:08:08.869 --> 01:08:15.410
They're not going to come up with the same
thrust profile as they start up.

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:18.710
The thrust vector misalignment is going to
be different.

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.279
And we also had to look at ignition over pressure.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:24.259
And I'll show you that was a surprise to us.

01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:30.279
Also part of liftoff we had to look at winds
and gusts, vortex shedding, proximity of aerodynamics

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:35.440
to the other structures is on the gantry in
the pad.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.818
And then we had to do the pressurization and
also look at shrinkage of these vehicles that

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:46.080
components or elements at cryo-temperatures.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:52.940
Here was a cross-section, in a generic sense,
of what's happening during liftoff.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:57.979
There is some combination of winds that you
have to account for.

01:08:57.979 --> 01:08:59.559
And I will show you what we did there.

01:08:59.559 --> 01:09:02.609
The thrust profile from the SSMEs.

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:09.479
The SRBs come up to thrust after you get confirmation
that the engines are operating at full performance.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:14.399
And there is a lot of vibration acceleration
going on.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:18.979
Here is something that becomes pretty obvious
after a while.

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:25.440
When you have a vehicle that is tied down
here with a base moment and you put 1.5 million

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.729
pounds of thrust on it, this vehicle is going
to bend over this way.

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:35.318
There is a lot of strained energy in the solid
rocket motors when that happens.

01:09:35.318 --> 01:09:43.649
If you were to ignite the SRBs, when that
vehicle is over here, the party is over because

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:47.210
it releases all that strained energy and the
SRBs couldn't take it.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:54.049
When you see the Orbiter prior to liftoff,
the SSMEs will come up, you will see the vehicle

01:09:54.049 --> 01:09:55.190
do like this.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:10:00.170
And then, when it comes back over zero, viola,
you kick off the SRBs.

01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:06.059
But you have to wait until it gets back to
that neutral point.

01:10:06.059 --> 01:10:08.230
A little detail that is pretty important.

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:13.340
Ascent.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:25.570
A really complicated part of the design of
the vehicle, especially with the aerodynamic

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:25.570
surfaces.
As I said before, you would like for these
things not to be there during ascent.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.050
They don't buy you anything.

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:35.610
You just need them coming back.

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:45.150
Some other complications here are the acoustic
effects will become important, as I'll show

01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:47.050
you, in acoustic fatigue for the vehicle.

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.110
I showed you life.

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.380
Well, that's going to be a critical thing.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:56.400
Another thing is the plumes of the vehicle
are changing the pressure distribution as

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.630
you're going up.

01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:04.150
The pressure distribution along the Orbiter,
especially the wing, is changing the whole

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:08.989
times you're accelerating, not only through
the various mach regimes but also because

01:11:08.989 --> 01:11:13.300
of the blockage from the plume expansion.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.460
We said how in the world are going to do that?

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.860
We cannot analyze all those things.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:24.840
If we do it deterministically, you won't get
a capability that you need, we thought, operational.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:30.630
We said what we'll do is one piece of data
that we had, we had synthetic wind profiles

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:32.800
for everything that existed at the Cape.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.030
We said that's a given.

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:40.280
We'll use these synthetic wind profiles as
a guideline to all of our winds aloft.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:46.480
What we need to do is decide what the angle
of attack and the side slip is going to be

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.860
through this vehicle flying through these
winds and a control system that's changing

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.770
the attitude of the vehicle.

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:57.850
That's a factor that we have to consider and
that's going to be important for the design

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:01.420
of the elevon surfaces and all because they're
getting loaded up pretty heavily at that time.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:08.600
There are dispersions in the propulsion system
that have to be added.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:16.380
And then what we decided to do, after we looked
at all that, we said what we're going to do

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:21.559
is we're going to take all these parameters,
and you won't find this in any textbook, but

01:12:21.559 --> 01:12:23.300
we created something called a squatcheloid.

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:26.260
And I forgot to look up what squatcheloid
means.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.610
It must be a Greek term that was really good.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:35.150
But what we did was flew the vehicle through
different mach numbers.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:44.179
And we looked at the various conditions we
could get at for combinations of dynamic pressure

01:12:44.179 --> 01:12:50.440
and angle of attack and dynamic pressure and
side slip for all the mach numbers, and then

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.969
we said is that realistic to do, not only
from a control systems standpoint but from

01:12:56.969 --> 01:12:59.260
a standpoint of the propulsion system capability?

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:05.780
And we said it is feasible to do so we ought
to design within those envelopes.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:12.390
What we did was walked our way around all
of these external points with pressure and

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:17.309
inertial loads and everything else and we
looked at the structural model that we had

01:13:17.309 --> 01:13:17.750
simplified.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:22.000
And we said we found the points that were
critical for the vertical stabilizer, for

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.860
the outboard elevon, et cetera, and that's
the way we designed the vehicle for ascent

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.130
loads.

01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:38.760
The thing that that enabled us to do, too,
is it enabled us to do a rational combination

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.960
that Aaron brought up a while ago.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.830
What did you do with the SSMEs for engine
out and that kind of stuff?

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:51.650
It let us do a rational combination of engine
out and also engine vector control.

01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:57.400
You could design the thrust structure so that
the engines went out to the extremes, but

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.150
it didn't make sense as far as the control
system was concerned.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:05.710
What we did is we saved a lot of weight in
the vehicle by using a deterministic or realistic,

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:16.489
I should say, SSME thrust profile and vector
characteristics.

01:14:16.489 --> 01:14:18.790
Well, I just mention that.

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:21.690
That's what the squatcheloid did for it.

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:28.130
Also what it did was then gave the guys who
were designing ascent trajectories, now they

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:36.000
had an envelope to design to, which was key
for their operations.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:36.770
Next problem.

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:38.400
Now we come back to descent loads.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:51.620
When you said that you designed it for realistic
cases instead of worst cases, does that mean

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.480
the engines were never able to vector all
the way out to maximum?

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:53.480
Right.
It just could not happen?

01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:57.699
It could not happen.

01:14:57.699 --> 01:15:01.370
That was a failure mode that it had enough
redundancy and it couldn't happen, and there

01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:04.610
wasn't any need of creating a load condition
like that.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:05.190
It couldn't happen.

01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:08.650
OK, so you looked for it.

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:14.440
We looked for the cases where you could be
in the worst case winds, the worst case misalignment

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.860
with the SRB, with the different throttling
of the engines.

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:23.659
And we did all that and said to control this
vehicle, because if you cannot control the

01:15:23.659 --> 01:15:26.250
vehicle there's no need to look at that load
case.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:31.840
We said to control it within those environments,
what's the extreme of the engines?

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.900
We said that's a design case for the thrust
structure.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.449
Good question.

01:15:40.449 --> 01:15:44.449
Descent loads.

01:15:44.449 --> 01:15:45.489
This was pretty easy.

01:15:45.489 --> 01:15:49.780
The structure guys said this is a piece of
cake because this vehicle is coming back in,

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:53.260
in a ballistic trajectory.

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:55.710
And, viola, there are not even loads on this
vehicle.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:16:00.030
Well, that didn't make a whole lot of sense
because we knew that there would have to be

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:03.840
more maneuvering capability than anybody was
fessing up to.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.460
Not that they weren't trying to hide it, but
we weren't smart enough.

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:14.380
The Aaron Cohen guys weren't smart enough
to know all the conditions we would have to

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:14.860
fly it to.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:23.710
What we did was we went through the classical
Venn diagram where you're plotting for different

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:28.100
mach numbers.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:34.230
The normal load factor versus the velocity
of the vehicle that it can fly in that flight

01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:35.710
regime.

01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:40.760
We said if this thing is going to behave like
an airplane and have to perform like an airplane,

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.809
we are going to design it like an airplane.

01:16:42.809 --> 01:16:44.370
We caught a lot of guff.

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:50.150
When Bass Redd comes in and talks in the future
ask him about this because he fought us on

01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:52.340
this hand and foot.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.690
He said you guys don't have to design it that
way.

01:16:54.690 --> 01:17:00.010
We said well, we're going to, but let him
have capability in his aerodynamics and talk

01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:02.170
to the control system guys about that, too.

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:05.760
And I see the Draper guys left on that.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:12.210
[LAUGHTER] We said we're going to build in
that capability for this thing to maneuver

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:12.900
like an airplane.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.610
2.5 g's normal load factor.

01:17:15.610 --> 01:17:21.110
Follow-up classical Venn diagram where we
have equivalent airspeed of 375 psf.

01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:27.380
We were determining what the equivalent air
speed for those conditions was.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:31.909
And then we did it.

01:17:31.909 --> 01:17:38.460
Now we've gotten up to a point I'll call CDR,
and a point I should have mentioned a while

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:39.449
ago.

01:17:39.449 --> 01:17:46.210
When I showed the authority to proceed, there
aren't any drawings which exist, except some

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:46.929
sketches.

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:50.270
I mean there are mol line drawings and that's
about it.

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:54.429
And the mol line of the vehicle was what came
out of all the other studies.

01:17:54.429 --> 01:17:58.610
It said that's it, we've got to put everything
within this mol line for this vehicle to perform

01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:59.860
like it is.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.719
But there are no detailed drawings.

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:06.850
When you get to a preliminary design review
in a classical design and development program,

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:13.659
typically that's about where you reach 10%
of your drawings that are released.

01:18:13.659 --> 01:18:15.440
And what does it mean to release a drawing?

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:22.620
That means you sign it off, whatever your
discipline is, and it say we can make this

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:28.630
airplane to these drawings and it's given
to the people to go make it.

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:33.179
So, once you release a drawing you don't ever
want to bring it back and change it because

01:18:33.179 --> 01:18:34.600
it costs you a lot of money.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:44.550
The PDR, which was somewhere like about '73,
'74, somewhere like that, that was the state

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.920
which we existed.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.330
We hadn't defined everything on the structural
low pass like I told you about a while ago,

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.260
nor the materials.

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.570
Now we're at the detail design.

01:18:53.570 --> 01:19:00.469
Now we're into CDR, that's the critical design
review, and 90% of all your drawings are released.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:03.989
And now it gets very expensive to go back
and change.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:09.059
You can just see how it would ripple through
the entire operation if you change a drawing

01:19:09.059 --> 01:19:09.590
at that time.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:13.570
You have to, to make it work sometimes, but
you like not to change it.

01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:18.020
What we have to do here, our challenge from
a structural point of view is to complete

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:22.659
the design, do some of the details which means
get weight out of the vehicle where you can

01:19:22.659 --> 01:19:25.179
scrape it without really changing a lot of
stuff.

01:19:25.179 --> 01:19:29.020
And then also decide how you're going to certify
the vehicle.

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:34.900
It means what you're going to do on the ground
to say it's really safe for the crew to get

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.340
in.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.010
That's what that was.

01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:41.730
Weight reduction is a major part of the program.

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:44.850
Here are some of the things that we took out
about this timeframe.

01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:48.340
We took out 900 pounds of weight in the payload
bay doors.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:54.469
We didn't change the configuration, they were
still flexible, but they were aluminum honeycomb.

01:19:54.469 --> 01:19:57.710
We said we can save 900 pounds if we go to
graphite/epoxy.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:03.530
Graphite/epoxy characterization of the material
didn't even exist then.

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:08.270
Literally Aaron, myself and three or four
other guys sat around.

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:12.659
We said OK, Aaron, this is what we have, this
is what we know about it, here are the risks

01:20:12.659 --> 01:20:15.040
associated and here is the weight savings.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.120
Go for it.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.929
So, we went for it and it worked.

01:20:17.929 --> 01:20:21.659
That was the largest graphite/epoxy structure
ever flown.

01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:26.510
We characterized it, passed that on to the
industry and that helped a bunch.

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:30.809
Another little interesting thing -- I have
to watch my time here.

01:20:30.809 --> 01:20:34.350
I mentioned the spending profile.

01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:40.010
Well, we got into the program about the time
we were starting to make the payload bay doors,

01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:43.559
which is probably '75, '76.

01:20:43.559 --> 01:20:46.750
And Aaron didn't get all the money that he
needed.

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:54.780
We built the first set of payload bay doors,
which is people process dependant.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.870
It's like laying up fiberglass.

01:20:55.870 --> 01:21:00.239
It was all hand layup with epoxy and bake
it and all that kind of stuff.

01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:05.190
We got the first set built and we fired everybody
because we didn't have enough money to keep

01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:07.290
them on the payroll for the rest of that year.

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:13.150
We literally laid everybody off at Rockwell
in Tulsa.

01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:17.650
And they came back a year later, not all of
them, but we had to start over again.

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:21.100
So, there is a risk associated with that.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:21.690
Thrust structure.

01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:26.670
We saved 1200 pounds by stiffening, like I
told you about a while ago.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:31.199
And then we used a bunch of other composites.

01:21:31.199 --> 01:21:36.030
A lot of people said, especially after Challenger,
let's get rid of this vehicle because it's

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:37.900
antiquated and was designed too long ago.

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:46.710
That probably is still one of the most advanced
composite structure vehicles flying today.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:51.880
Except, where there is a lot of aluminum honeycomb,
you probably could go with graphite/epoxy.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.110
And I will give you a challenge with that
later on.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:59.670
But there are beryllium aluminum struts in
here.

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:03.260
There are boron/epoxy scab on devices.

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.949
There is graphite/epoxy all over the vehicle.

01:22:05.949 --> 01:22:07.110
Not all over the vehicle.

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:08.800
In a lot of places in the vehicle.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.380
The vehicle has got a lot of composites.

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:17.059
And we stretched to be able to do that.

01:22:17.059 --> 01:22:17.540
Certification.

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:20.429
Now we've got the thing pretty well designed.

01:22:20.429 --> 01:22:22.870
What are we going to do to certify this thing?

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:27.590
This is where we deviated from the norm and
were pretty innovative.

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:34.719
Classically, in the way this program started
off, there was a dedicated structural test

01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:40.190
article and there was a dedicated fatigue
test article.

01:22:40.190 --> 01:22:42.070
There were a couple of problems with that.

01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:46.940
If you don't need it, you might as well not
build it, even though that was in the program.

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:52.699
The situation was, as I showed you a while
ago, thermal stress was a major part of that.

01:22:52.699 --> 01:22:59.580
You couldn't apply a mechanical and thermal
load to this vehicle and still be practical.

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.590
Concorde did it.

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:08.100
The way that Concorde was designed and certified,
they applied mechanical loads in an environment

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:13.020
in which they could induce the temperature
by convective heating on that vehicle.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.460
And it took them like three years to test
the vehicle.

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:19.030
And it was extremely expensive.

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:24.760
It was a big jobs program for Greg Britton
and France and some of the others, but we

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:28.949
decided we couldn't afford to do that so we
are going to have to figure out how else to

01:23:28.949 --> 01:23:29.219
do it.

01:23:29.219 --> 01:23:37.010
Besides that, Aaron had $100 million problem
that year.

01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:40.530
What can you guy help us do?

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:51.070
What we'll do, we think we can do this, is
take an airframe and we will apply 110% of

01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:54.940
the limit mechanical loads only to it.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.989
And that doesn't certify anything.

01:23:56.989 --> 01:24:00.170
And then we will put strain gauges all over
this vehicle.

01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:07.360
And we will pre-predict what the strain response
is going to be for 3,000 points on the vehicle.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:13.050
If we can pre-predict what the strain response
is for applying a bunch of different loads

01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:17.440
then we know how to analyze the vehicle.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.800
That proves we know how to analyze it.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:29.620
We can extrapolate to 140% to our ultimate
load capability from mechanical, and we will

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:32.739
add the thermal stress to it analytically.

01:24:32.739 --> 01:24:34.889
So, we did that.

01:24:34.889 --> 01:24:39.550
And then we refurbished the vehicle and that
became Challenger.

01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:43.080
The test article is going to cost $100 million.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.429
We said we don't need it.

01:24:44.429 --> 01:24:47.179
We'll use it for a flight airframe.

01:24:47.179 --> 01:24:51.320
And Aaron gave us a little ceramic eagle for
doing it.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.469
Don't anybody expect As out of this deal,
if Aaron has anything to do with it.

01:24:57.469 --> 01:24:57.800
There it was.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:05.620
We applied the million and a half pounds of
load at the backend.

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:11.690
We concentrated through loading fixtures,
loads on the wings of the fuselage, put pressure

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:18.380
differential at various points on the vehicle,
and we did exactly what I said.

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:20.179
Fatigue life.

01:25:20.179 --> 01:25:21.780
Mechanical fatigue was not a problem.

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:26.190
Acoustic fatigue was an issue because we had
some really lightweight structures and really

01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:27.389
high acoustic levels.

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:29.820
You cannot see it here.

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:37.780
It was like 165 DB around the base-end of
the thing, lower levels on other portions,

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.130
so we said how are we going to do that?

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.559
We came up with a different way to do it.

01:25:42.559 --> 01:25:49.880
What we will do is we'll go around the vehicle
and we will identify a characteristic structure,

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:58.309
graphite/epoxy, aluminum, 7075-T6 aluminum
fuselage up here, wing elevon, aluminum honeycomb,

01:25:58.309 --> 01:25:59.900
et cetera.

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:03.980
We identified 44 test articles.

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.870
We said that's what we'll do.

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:11.550
We went to Aaron and said it's going to take
us 44 test articles.

01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:18.170
We went through all the rationale with each
one of them, and he said you can have 14.

01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:20.199
And so we said but that won't work.

01:26:20.199 --> 01:26:21.710
He said go figure it out.

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.610
We went back and scratched out heads.

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:26.429
Sure enough, we figured out how to do more
extrapolation.

01:26:26.429 --> 01:26:29.280
So, we had 14 test articles that you see.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.360
And then what we did was say now we've got
our test articles.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:40.239
Our approach to this thing was we would test
them to failure acoustically.

01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:46.170
Now we have an acoustic allowable for that
type of structure because it's a function

01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:47.070
of the details.

01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:48.210
I mean it had to be the detail.

01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:54.320
And, in addition to making sure we have a
good test, if this was our acoustic fatigue

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.070
test article, only the center third was a
viable part of the test because the rest of

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:02.820
it is boundary conditions that weren't right
because they were clamped along the edges

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:03.550
or whatever.

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:07.719
We said only the middle third of the test
article is viable.

01:27:07.719 --> 01:27:14.090
We tested that, we got a fatigue allowable
from acoustics and then we degraded it analytically

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.449
for combined mechanical and combined thermal.

01:27:17.449 --> 01:27:21.090
We did that and said also we know that it's
probably not going to fail on the first flight

01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:22.190
so we'll do some inspections.

01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:24.550
Tom, let me just make a comment.

01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:26.600
He made it sound a lot simpler than it was.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.409
One thing that's important, whenever you do
a project or you're in charge of something,

01:27:31.409 --> 01:27:35.389
you don't want to have yes people around you.

01:27:35.389 --> 01:27:38.929
You want to have people that say you're not
doing it right.

01:27:38.929 --> 01:27:39.489
And it didn't go down that simple.

01:27:39.489 --> 01:27:41.219
They were not yes people, believe me.

01:27:41.219 --> 01:27:45.190
They were certainly not yes, sir, we're going
to go do this.

01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:49.080
That's very important.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.429
It's a wonder we still speak to one another.

01:27:52.429 --> 01:27:53.309
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry.

01:27:53.309 --> 01:27:54.940
I don't know what a test article is.

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:55.770
It's a test specimen.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:28:00.850
If you wanted to put so much mass in here
and you weren't sure whether this seam was

01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:01.320
going to work.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.210
You just put that much mass in here.

01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:05.940
You add a little bit more to it and you see
if that seam breaks.

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.780
That's your test article.

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.870
That's what it is, just a test specimen, test
article.

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:19.139
But that's a good point because, don't forget,
we start off with two entire $100 million

01:28:19.139 --> 01:28:22.870
test articles for static test and for fatigue
test.

01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.830
Not counting acoustic fatigue.

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.580
That was just mechanical fatigue.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:30.300
As we got into it we said we don't need that.

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.750
Did the Challenger's mission life drop because
of the test?

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:35.880
No.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.080
As a matter of fact, that's a very good question.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:44.580
That was one of the questions that was asked
by the investigation is what's different about

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:45.920
this vehicle than any other vehicles?

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.489
Well, it was a static test article.

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:55.650
And we showed ad nauseam that had nothing
to do with the failure of Challenger.

01:28:55.650 --> 01:29:02.460
The leading edge was not -- Oh, no, excuse
me.

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.780
I'm off on Columbia now.

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.420
No, it didn't have anything to do with it.

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:16.760
As a matter of fact, this is getting into
detailed details now, when you apply above

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:25.320
a limit load on a vehicle like we did on Challenger
it puts a lot of the joints in residual compression.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.370
There is compression at the joint just as
you load it and you unload it.

01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:35.320
And residual compression increases the fatigue
life of the vehicle.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:40.219
And the reason it does is because fatigue
is the function of tensile cycles, not compressive

01:29:40.219 --> 01:29:42.630
cycles normally.

01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:49.719
When McDonnell Douglas tested a DC-10 and
they proof load a vehicle, it carries a premium

01:29:49.719 --> 01:29:55.610
on the selling price for that because it theoretically
has a longer life than one that hasn't been

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:56.380
loaded.

01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:57.550
Good question.

01:29:57.550 --> 01:30:00.520
Tom, one more question.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.260
Yeah.

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:04.469
How much did an increase in computer processing
speed and availability allow you to do these

01:30:04.469 --> 01:30:09.889
extrapolations and like do the thermal testing
just analytically?

01:30:09.889 --> 01:30:15.130
Was that a key factor?

01:30:15.130 --> 01:30:16.830
You mean how much as it increased?

01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:20.750
Well, how much did it increase between like,
say, Apollo and designing the Shuttle.

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.719
Not a whole lot.

01:30:22.719 --> 01:30:29.080
As far as the analytical capabilities of the
finite element models and all, you could get

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.710
more detail through simplification.

01:30:31.710 --> 01:30:34.159
There are more elements available, let me
put it that way.

01:30:34.159 --> 01:30:39.350
But as far as the crunching capability, it
increased somewhat but we were still, you

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:43.850
know, if you have to go from here to here,
we were about here.

01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:46.420
That isn't a quantitative answer for you,
but we're still a long way.

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.590
We basically used mainframes, and we did have
the NASTRAN model.

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:51.389
Yeah, we had NASTRAN.

01:30:51.389 --> 01:30:59.889
But NASTRAN didn't have, on a large model
like that, the large capability for structural

01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:00.550
loads and thermal loads.

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:08.350
But you used to put your cards in one day
and it would take a couple days before you

01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:09.040
got your answer.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:17.150
To do a complete load cycle on this vehicle
for internal loads it was something like three

01:31:17.150 --> 01:31:20.120
months it would take us to do that.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:27.590
And so it was quite [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:28.219
That's another story.

01:31:28.219 --> 01:31:30.889
Thermal protection system.

01:31:30.889 --> 01:31:32.030
Change gears now.

01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:36.309
Let's talk about the thing that protects the
vehicle.

01:31:36.309 --> 01:31:44.170
Now I'm going to switch back and go back to
get ready to proceed toward preliminary design.

01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:46.650
What were the requirements on the thermal
protection system?

01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:52.820
It had to protect the vehicle from max temperatures
like about 2800 degrees on the surface, reusable

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:56.300
100 times, it had to be lightweight and had
to be cost-effective.

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.489
Pretty simple high-level requirements.

01:31:58.489 --> 01:31:58.600
And Dr.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:06.790
Bob Ried will talk to you about the things
that they derived as far as the aerothermal

01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:11.260
in this and how it became that, but it was
a given to us.

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:13.050
What did we know about this thing?

01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:17.190
Well, we had some ablative TPS experience
from Apollo.

01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:24.000
Gemini had some metallic TPS on it primarily
Rene 41 and some other exotic materials.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.510
Mercury had an ablative TPS, but they weren't
reusable.

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:36.179
They were hot structure designs which existed
but that we didn't have materials that could

01:32:36.179 --> 01:32:41.010
carry the load at temperature such that it
could be a fully hot structural design, and

01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:43.100
that was extremely complex.

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:51.309
Metallic TPS, we could get there theoretically
with some fairly exotic materials called columbium

01:32:51.309 --> 01:32:59.679
and Rene 41 and some other things, but the
devil is in the detail in that.

01:32:59.679 --> 01:33:03.850
Let me tell you a story about that.

01:33:03.850 --> 01:33:07.719
We were looking at some Haynes 188 panels.

01:33:07.719 --> 01:33:13.940
And so we had a test article, a big panel
about the size of the desk that you're sitting

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:19.889
at, any one of you there, and it was corrugated
so that it could expand and contract.

01:33:19.889 --> 01:33:26.610
And it was good for 1800 degrees, so we tested
it to 1800 degrees in the center of the panel

01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:27.489
multiple times.

01:33:27.489 --> 01:33:34.370
And it had a frame around it where the panel
could move around because it needed to, to

01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:36.760
be able to thermally expand.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:42.780
And the center of the panel was 1800 degrees,
the edge of the panel where the heat sink

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:47.080
was, was 40 degrees lower temperature than
the center.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:54.940
And the panel floated within a gap maybe about
like that, so it could move around pretty

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:55.580
good.

01:33:55.580 --> 01:34:00.840
But what it also did, with that temperature
differential of 40 degrees, we got something

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.699
called creep buckling.

01:34:02.699 --> 01:34:08.389
The structure expanded and crept and deformed
permanently.

01:34:08.389 --> 01:34:12.460
Had we flown that vehicle, had we designed
a vehicle like that, what that would have

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:19.320
done is would have allowed plasma to flow
through the shingles, if you will, and into

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.260
the structure.

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.530
And that's exactly what happened in Columbia.

01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:28.880
Letting the hot plasma gas get in the vehicle,
you cannot stand it.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.070
It's the details about that.

01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:33.290
We said we're not going to go with a metallic
design.

01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:35.540
Plus, if you scratch it, it oxidizes.

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.870
And, if it oxidizes, then it can fail.

01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:46.969
So we went with something that was just coming
online, and that was a fused silica material.

01:34:46.969 --> 01:34:54.260
And fused silica is pure sand, pure silica
material.

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.679
That's all in the world it is.

01:34:56.679 --> 01:35:04.670
The process is you make it into a fibrous
structure, if you will.

01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:06.550
Fibrous material is a better term.

01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:10.500
A fibrous material that is mostly air.

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.540
It is about the same density as balsa wood.

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:21.330
It has an ultimate strength of about 12 psi,
tensile load is about all that it can take,

01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:24.969
but it has a thermal performance that is fantastic.

01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:36.889
As you will recall this chart here, when you
look at LI-1500, is what that was with aluminum,

01:35:36.889 --> 01:35:42.330
and that's what we went with, we used this
same characterization to decide what the material

01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:49.909
we were going to use was on the vehicle from
a weight standpoint and a cost standpoint.

01:35:49.909 --> 01:36:01.239
The way the tiles work thermally like this
is the low strength brittle, almost like glassy

01:36:01.239 --> 01:36:10.080
material, it's a ceramic, is coated with literally
a glass coating on the outside about 60-thousandths

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.659
of an inch thick and it's black.

01:36:12.659 --> 01:36:19.650
As the vehicle comes back in and dissipates
its energy through drag and heating, 90% of

01:36:19.650 --> 01:36:25.590
the heat is radiated away from the vehicle,
10% of it goes into the vehicle.

01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:32.119
But this is such a good thermal isolator,
a poor thermal conductor, by the time the

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:39.889
heat gets to the vehicle, the vehicle is back
into an atmosphere where it's not heating

01:36:39.889 --> 01:36:40.630
anymore.

01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:47.739
That dictated the thickness of these tiles,
of this silica material.

01:36:47.739 --> 01:37:00.460
The vehicle has got almost 21,000 tiles on
it, and they vary anywhere from a half inch

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.949
thick up to about three inches thick.

01:37:03.949 --> 01:37:08.800
It's sculptured to stay within the mol line
because the aerodynamicist told us what it

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.510
has to be.

01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:18.880
And so what we did was sculptured the TPS
so that we didn't have any more than we needed.

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.420
Great job by all the thermal analysts.

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:23.719
I mean they did this fantastic.

01:37:23.719 --> 01:37:27.090
I want to mention, when that says 9 pound
or 22 pound tiles, that's not the weight of

01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:29.550
each individual tile, that's the density per
cubic foot.

01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.699
Per cubic foot, correct.

01:37:29.699 --> 01:37:29.809
Thank you, Jeff.

01:37:29.809 --> 01:37:33.239
What was the footnote about Columbia on that?

01:37:33.239 --> 01:37:38.230
On the last chart, Tom, there is a footnote
about the difference in the Columbia.

01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:47.130
Let me come back to that in just one second.

01:37:47.130 --> 01:37:52.250
What I want to talk to you about right now,
this is something I had from some old material.

01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:54.050
I was just trying to get a characterization.

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:58.909
What that said is on Columbia there was an
infrared sensor as an experiment.

01:37:58.909 --> 01:38:02.949
So, the number of tiles varied on that vehicle
compared to all the other vehicles because

01:38:02.949 --> 01:38:06.570
of this infrared thing at the top of the vertical
stabilizer.

01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:10.699
I should have cut that off.

01:38:10.699 --> 01:38:11.650
You're reading too close.

01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:22.880
[LAUGHTER] We thought let's figure out how
to take this fragile material and put it on

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.219
this aluminum structure which has a high thermal
coefficient of expansion.

01:38:26.219 --> 01:38:30.809
The tiles have almost a zero thermal coefficient
expansion.

01:38:30.809 --> 01:38:33.199
We said we've got to isolate that.

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:39.030
We put a strain isolation pad [UNINTELLIGIBLE
PHRASE].

01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:44.659
Why do they vary in density?

01:38:44.659 --> 01:38:45.600
Yeah.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.790
Because primarily for strength, for one of
the things.

01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:56.199
And the LI-2200 was a little bit higher temperature
capability.

01:38:56.199 --> 01:39:00.730
And I don't remember [OVERLAPPING VOICES].

01:39:00.730 --> 01:39:06.940
But it had a little higher peak temperature
capability.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:14.630
And that was dictated by what one of the failure
modes of a tile was if you exceed the temperature

01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:15.960
too much it starts slumping.

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:19.619
I don't want to say melting but it begins
to distort.

01:39:19.619 --> 01:39:26.580
And a LI-2200 didn't distort to the same extent
that a LI-900 tile did.

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:37.980
We said let's isolate the structure here from
this material up here which is required to

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:42.119
keep from failing all these tiles, so we put
something between them.

01:39:42.119 --> 01:39:47.679
It was just a very loosely woven felt material.

01:39:47.679 --> 01:39:53.230
Now we proved that the aluminum can expand
all it wants to, or within limits, we looked

01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:59.550
at it realistically, and that the tile was
OK, except the tile couldn't be too large

01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:02.320
because of this relative expansion and contraction.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.719
So, that dictated the size of the tile.

01:40:05.719 --> 01:40:08.570
We literally pre-cracked them, if you will.

01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:12.139
We put expansion joints is another way of
looking at it.

01:40:12.139 --> 01:40:17.889
A typical tile is 6 inches by 6 inches when
it gets into the highly heated area.

01:40:17.889 --> 01:40:22.489
Now all of a sudden we've got some room for
the title to move relative to one another,

01:40:22.489 --> 01:40:26.550
structure to move underneath it because of
the strain isolation pad.

01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:29.540
And we said, viola, we've got this problem
fixed.

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:31.630
We're good to go..

01:40:31.630 --> 01:40:50.960
We said we've got 25,000 of these tiles that
we now have to certify that they're good to

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:51.540
go for the vehicle.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:53.920
There were gaps between the tiles?

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.309
Correct.

01:40:54.309 --> 01:40:59.869
But, when you re-enter, do the tiles expand
so that there are no gaps?

01:40:59.869 --> 01:41:00.260
No.

01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:06.909
What we do is make sure that the gap can just
close but not close such that you're loading

01:41:06.909 --> 01:41:09.340
one tile relative to the other.

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:10.559
That set the gap.

01:41:10.559 --> 01:41:16.989
And, if during manufacturing which is not
that precise, if the gap was too large we

01:41:16.989 --> 01:41:18.679
just stuck a gap filler in.

01:41:18.679 --> 01:41:20.420
Not the one that was on the last vehicle.

01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:21.429
It's a different kind of gap fill.

01:41:21.429 --> 01:41:28.780
Just a piece of Nomex or SIP material strain
isolation pad coated with rubber or with RTV,

01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:32.989
and we stuck it in between the tile just to
reduce the flow if the gap was too large.

01:41:32.989 --> 01:41:40.480
So there is no chance that you would have
hot plasma coming in between them?

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.340
Yes, there is a chance you can have plasma
going through there if the gap is too large.

01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:44.750
We had a very specific requirement.

01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:48.530
I think it was like 90-thousandths of an inch
between tiles.

01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:54.650
And if it were, say, 130-thousandths of an
inch, as installed because of tolerance buildup

01:41:54.650 --> 01:42:00.350
and all that kind of stuff, then what we did
was stuck a plasma flow preclude, if you will,

01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:06.440
a gap filler between those to stop the plasma
flow from getting between the tiles.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:13.420
And we had some experience where we lost some
gap fillers, plasma flowed between the tiles,

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:17.869
caused excessive heating on the tiles and
started causing them to slump and melt a little

01:42:17.869 --> 01:42:22.530
bit, did a little bit of structural deformation
but nothing significant.

01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:27.929
Losing gap filler was a turnaround issue,
not a safety of flight issue.

01:42:27.929 --> 01:42:29.309
We made sure of that.

01:42:29.309 --> 01:42:29.670
Excellent question.

01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:33.170
This is more of a general question, but I'm
wondering if since then anybody has done any

01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:37.199
work to find a material that could accomplish
both tasks, the structure and the thermal

01:42:37.199 --> 01:42:46.030
protection rather than having to deal with
these types of issues.

01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:51.380
That was back to one of my trades were we
said let's take that approach and see if we

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:57.389
cannot design a vehicle that can take the
temperature and the loads, too, both.

01:42:57.389 --> 01:42:59.130
There was no material that existed.

01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:04.559
I don't think a material exists today that
I know of to be worked to a high enough stress

01:43:04.559 --> 01:43:08.619
that you can keep the weight down to have
those kinds of temperatures and to be worked

01:43:08.619 --> 01:43:10.020
at a high temperature.

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:18.460
I think on the X-33 design they were talking
once again of trying to make it out of a metallic

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:18.710
structure.

01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:21.469
Part of it was structure and part of it was
tons.

01:43:21.469 --> 01:43:28.350
But we never got to the point of being able
to fly and test it.

01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:35.389
But they also were using a thermal isolation
system like tiles over part of the vehicle

01:43:35.389 --> 01:43:36.500
on the X-33.

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:51.110
The Buran, which was the Soviet copy of the
Shuttle, they were very anxious to get away

01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:53.369
from the expense of the tiles.

01:43:53.369 --> 01:43:54.540
And they ended up with a thermal protection
system not very different than what you said.

01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:55.350
You mean they had tiles?

01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.940
Yeah.

01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:00.510
As a matter of fact, I remember they were
more like bigger blankets.

01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:01.409
That's a good point, Larry.

01:44:01.409 --> 01:44:03.480
I was about to skip over it.

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:08.880
I said they were typically 6 inches where
they were really thick, but in other areas

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:14.690
we made like 12 or 15 inch tiles that were
very thin.

01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:22.400
And the reason we could do that is we decided
if they crack it doesn't matter because the

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.929
gap wouldn't be large enough for the plasma
flow to go through there and it would simply

01:44:26.929 --> 01:44:27.869
be a self-relieving.

01:44:27.869 --> 01:44:33.619
So, we tried to reduce the cost of manufacturing
by making some of these tiles larger.

01:44:33.619 --> 01:44:35.670
And I will show you that in just a second.

01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:53.290
I'm going to skip forward here and show you
one thing..

01:44:53.290 --> 01:44:57.960
That's 50-thousandths of an inch.

01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:08.940
The allowable for the tile was 12 psi.

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:12.230
The ultimate stress was 12 psi.

01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:14.610
The allowable stress was about 8 psi.

01:45:14.610 --> 01:45:19.219
And that's with the total loads combined on
the tile.

01:45:19.219 --> 01:45:25.360
What do you have to consider in one of these
25,000 tiles that you have to assure is not

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.230
going to come off the vehicle?

01:45:26.230 --> 01:45:32.570
Remember I said when we looked in the early
phase studies of the vehicle we were looking

01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:34.440
at wing loads and stuff like that?

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.139
Then we got into how is the wing going to
carry the load into the fuselage to the spar

01:45:39.139 --> 01:45:40.619
and what was our design trade on that?

01:45:40.619 --> 01:45:45.630
Those were sort of macro and semi-macro systems
engineering studies.

01:45:45.630 --> 01:45:47.409
Now we're into a micro.

01:45:47.409 --> 01:45:51.869
Now we've got this little critical part, 6
inches by 6 inches.

01:45:51.869 --> 01:45:54.690
Lose any one of about 10,000 and you lose
the vehicle.

01:45:54.690 --> 01:45:59.489
It's got an 8 psi allowable strength.

01:45:59.489 --> 01:46:01.480
We said well, that's no big deal.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.239
What are all the environments on this thing?

01:46:04.239 --> 01:46:09.429
We started looking at pre-liftoff, liftoff,
ascent, et cetera.

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:12.770
There is always something called mismatch.

01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:18.219
When you take something that is not perfectly
smooth and you bond something to it and they

01:46:18.219 --> 01:46:25.520
are not to the same flatness, if you will,
there is going to be a stress induced into

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.219
both parts of those.

01:46:26.219 --> 01:46:30.510
Well, the structure doesn't care about that
stress but this little 8 psi allowable tile

01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.790
does.

01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:38.050
It says we cannot exceed about 19-thousandths
of an inch under one of these tiles for this

01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:39.869
to happen.

01:46:39.869 --> 01:46:43.010
There is ignition over pressure during ascent.

01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:47.320
There is acoustic and vibration and that kind
of stuff that has to be considered.

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:53.480
On ascent there are gradients because of shock
moving across the tile.

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.790
There is internal pressure.

01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:58.429
There is skin friction and drag on the tile,
so you've got to consider that.

01:46:58.429 --> 01:47:02.889
You have to consider the dynamics, the inertial
loads induced in it.

01:47:02.889 --> 01:47:06.710
And the out of plane deflection is now the
vehicle flying.

01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:08.030
The structure is deforming.

01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:10.210
So, you've got to consider that.

01:47:10.210 --> 01:47:15.650
Now you can see you've got 25,000 tiles with
all these combinations of load conditions

01:47:15.650 --> 01:47:20.750
so how in the hell do you design that?

01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:22.480
This is the characterization of it.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:33.590
This is what happens with a structural deformation
of like 10-thousandths of an inch deflection

01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:35.010
underneath a tile.

01:47:35.010 --> 01:47:38.050
With that kind of formation it causes 1 psi.

01:47:38.050 --> 01:47:40.420
And it linear almost.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:44.670
So, 20-thousandths of an inch deflection is
going to cause 2 psi.

01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:50.260
Well, 2 psi is not a lot but it's a quarter
of your allowable.

01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.389
We said we've got to consider that.

01:47:52.389 --> 01:47:57.880
We have to understand what is happening to
this structure as you fly it, a condition.

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:03.170
This is a free body, if you will, of the pressure
distribution on a tile.

01:48:03.170 --> 01:48:06.190
It has internal pressure within the tile.

01:48:06.190 --> 01:48:10.230
It has a pressure differential on the outside
of the tile because of a shockwave moving

01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:14.480
across it because of the pressure as it varies
around the vehicle.

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:18.360
So, you have to consider all of that.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:26.130
We did all that and said we've got a problem,
because what happened was all of a sudden

01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:31.559
our allowable on our tile was decreased by
half.

01:48:31.559 --> 01:48:36.040
And this was not good.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.949
We screwed up, in the systems engineering
point of view, when we did this.

01:48:39.949 --> 01:48:46.830
Remember we put the strain isolation pad underneath
the tile and we did all these other loads

01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:47.520
on it?

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.460
What we forgot, or what we didn't realize
was this strain isolation pad had little stiff

01:48:53.460 --> 01:49:00.880
spots in it because of the way it was stitched
to keep the strain isolation pad together.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.570
And every stiff spot acted like a hard point.

01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:10.429
Now, when you take a tile and you put external
loads on it and there is a stress concentration

01:49:10.429 --> 01:49:14.989
on each one of those things, that stress concentration
had an amplification of two.

01:49:14.989 --> 01:49:18.900
All of a sudden our allowable were decreased
by a factor of two.

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:22.170
And we thought we have a major problem.

01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:26.760
This is when Aaron and I got to know one another
better than we ever wanted to.

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.929
We met every day on this thing.

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:31.820
We had tiles bonded all over the vehicle.

01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.380
Necessity was the mother of invention.

01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:41.099
What we had to do was dissipate this stress
concentration.

01:49:41.099 --> 01:49:45.820
We said we'll put a plate underneath it, a
graphite/epoxy plate or something like that.

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.690
That would have added a lot of weight to the
vehicle.

01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:55.639
Glen Ecord, a materials guy came up with the
idea in the lab one weekend, he took silica

01:49:55.639 --> 01:50:00.840
powder in water and just painted it on the
bottom of the tile.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:06.369
What it did was fill all the pours in the
tile for about three-sixteenths of an inch.

01:50:06.369 --> 01:50:11.690
And just compacted themselves in there.

01:50:11.690 --> 01:50:18.929
And that was an inherent capability of a tile
with that powder packed in it, if you will,

01:50:18.929 --> 01:50:20.360
that doubled the strength of the tile.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.380
What it did is it dissipated the load from
being concentrated into the tile.

01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:31.270
So, without any weight, some cost, we had
to pull some tiles off the vehicle and densify

01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.449
them.

01:50:31.449 --> 01:50:33.710
Now all tiles are densified.

01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:38.780
I meant to bring one to show you today but
I didn't.

01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:41.929
Analytically, we went through 25,000 tiles.

01:50:41.929 --> 01:50:46.280
Here was our factor of safety distribution
over the entire vehicle.

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:55.230
We said we're good for that, but the thing
we don't know is if the tile is really bonded

01:50:55.230 --> 01:50:57.860
on the vehicle like it should be.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:01.409
We said we can fix that problem.

01:51:01.409 --> 01:51:02.250
We will verify it.

01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:09.710
We will pull on every tile and make sure that
it has a capability of the maximum expected

01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:12.190
mechanical load that it is going to see.

01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:14.440
And so we pulled on every tile.

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:20.270
And John Yardley, being an old stress guy,
says let me ask you a question.

01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:25.040
When you pull on every tile, how do you know
you haven't induced more damage and decreased

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:29.639
the allowable of the title because of your
proof test?

01:51:29.639 --> 01:51:30.119
Good question.

01:51:30.119 --> 01:51:31.690
Easy answer.

01:51:31.690 --> 01:51:37.360
We'll put a microphone on every tile and we
will characterize the sound of the tile as

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:43.440
we pull up on it, and we will get a sound
allowable, if you will, for proof-testing

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:43.989
the tile.

01:51:43.989 --> 01:51:46.739
We did that on every tile that had to be proof-tested.

01:51:46.739 --> 01:51:53.290
We had an acoustic emission device, we had
a microphone on there, we characterized all

01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:56.760
these tiles and we did it.

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:03.280
Another little mother's necessity of invention.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.380
And I'm not going to go through this.

01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.550
You'll get a handout of this.

01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:10.219
What this did is said you cannot proof load
every tile, every tile is not densified, some

01:52:10.219 --> 01:52:19.330
tiles are thick, some tiles are thin, but
prove under no uncertain conditions that you're

01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:20.699
safe to fly.

01:52:20.699 --> 01:52:24.099
We went through this logic on everything.

01:52:24.099 --> 01:52:27.309
Some of these things had gates that said go
directly to fly.

01:52:27.309 --> 01:52:28.780
Others we had to go through.

01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:34.449
Others we had to pull off the vehicle and
densify and proof load and do a bunch of other

01:52:34.449 --> 01:52:37.909
things to prove that they were OK.

01:52:37.909 --> 01:52:39.349
We got there.

01:52:39.349 --> 01:52:41.080
Now we're into operations.

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.580
We're just about out of time.

01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:43.080
I know.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.290
I've got three minutes left.

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:45.639
Can I have all three?

01:52:45.639 --> 01:52:45.849
OK.

01:52:45.849 --> 01:52:49.889
Here is what we did.

01:52:49.889 --> 01:52:53.800
We did some pretty innovative things on this
thing, and I think I've shown you some of

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.260
that stuff.

01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:58.290
But what were the surprises we had on the
first flight?

01:52:58.290 --> 01:52:59.409
Not very many.

01:52:59.409 --> 01:53:04.730
As we were going uphill, I told you about
the plume effect from the engines blocking

01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:09.650
the flow, that causes the pressure distribution
on the wing to be different than we designed

01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:09.830
for.

01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:13.050
The center pressure was further aft and outboard.

01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:14.869
That loaded up the wing more.

01:53:14.869 --> 01:53:19.639
It could not fly to the design conditions
that we needed to under worse case.

01:53:19.639 --> 01:53:22.270
And I'll tell you what we did on that.

01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:23.639
Well, let me just tell you right now.

01:53:23.639 --> 01:53:30.699
What we did was almost day-of-launch wind
analysis, loads analysis for the wings with

01:53:30.699 --> 01:53:36.199
load indicators in the wing to understand
what a specific flight regime was going to

01:53:36.199 --> 01:53:37.309
do for that vehicle.

01:53:37.309 --> 01:53:42.500
And we literally designed the trajectories
for the first six or eight or ten shuttle

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:47.980
flights so it stayed within a reduced capability
of the vehicle.

01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:50.699
Because we characterized it so well, we could
do that.

01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:59.659
The other thing was the overpressure of the
vehicle, when the main engines let off there

01:53:59.659 --> 01:54:02.440
was an accumulation of hydrogen gas underneath
the vehicle.

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:10.349
And as soon as the engines fired it ignited
that hydrogen and sent a big shockwave up

01:54:10.349 --> 01:54:10.800
the vehicle.

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:16.909
It could have been pretty bad but it wasn't,
so we fixed that by isolating the isolation

01:54:16.909 --> 01:54:19.610
and also burning it off prior to engine ignition.

01:54:19.610 --> 01:54:25.059
And then we got some tile damage from external
tank.

01:54:25.059 --> 01:54:26.750
We fixed that.

01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:31.219
After about the second or third flight on
the external tank, we changed the foam process

01:54:31.219 --> 01:54:33.590
and controlled that.

01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:36.590
And so those were our only surprises.

01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:42.900
You remember the chart that I showed you of
all the combined environments on a tile?

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:46.880
This is not politically correct what I'm going
to say, but I'm going to say it anyway.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.639
The shockwaves, the pressure, the out of plane
deformation, all that, you didn't see debris

01:54:51.639 --> 01:54:54.679
anyplace on that chart.

01:54:54.679 --> 01:54:58.780
Those tiles are not designed for debris, period.

01:54:58.780 --> 01:54:59.929
You can rationalize it.

01:54:59.929 --> 01:55:00.699
You can arm wave it.

01:55:00.699 --> 01:55:02.570
You can statistically analyze it.

01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:06.090
The vehicle is not designed to fly in debris.

01:55:06.090 --> 01:55:10.599
It can take every other thing it's designed
for, but it cannot take what it's not designed

01:55:10.599 --> 01:55:11.260
for.

01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:12.909
The engineers today have two choices.

01:55:12.909 --> 01:55:18.670
They can either eliminate the debris from
the external tank or, in my judgment, they

01:55:18.670 --> 01:55:22.619
can go back and recertify the tiles for the
expected debris.

01:55:22.619 --> 01:55:27.739
And that's probably not too big a deal, but
they cannot say we're ready to fly, going

01:55:27.739 --> 01:55:32.010
through a logic matrix like I did, until they
do that.

01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:35.010
OK, guys and gals.

01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:36.929
Here are some challenges for you.

01:55:36.929 --> 01:55:42.290
As you go through from the beginning of a
program, I would like you to be looking at

01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:48.260
this crew exploration vehicle, what other
parameters would you look at other than what

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:52.699
I've shown you here and what tools would you
use?

01:55:52.699 --> 01:55:56.480
On the combined thermal mechanical, I think
a lot can be done on that.

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:00.480
I don't know what all the computing capability
is today, but I think that you could really

01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:09.030
simplify and probably decrease the weight
of the vehicle by doing that.

01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:10.520
Could they be made more rugged?

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.580
Yeah, they probably could.

01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:14.050
But be careful.

01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:18.559
This is a big systems engineering issue and
it's a political issue.

01:56:18.559 --> 01:56:22.449
And I'm going to get off the stage here in
one second.

01:56:22.449 --> 01:56:30.199
Should there be a dedicated crew escape system
or should the reliability be built in the

01:56:30.199 --> 01:56:31.110
vehicle?

01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:34.570
And I'll promise you that answer is not known.

01:56:34.570 --> 01:56:39.150
It may be known from a political standpoint
that you have to have a crew escape system,

01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:40.790
and that's OK.

01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:45.730
If that's a requirement, that's a requirement,
but in a total system crew safety reliability

01:56:45.730 --> 01:56:47.559
that's not obvious.

01:56:47.559 --> 01:56:52.980
It depends on what the design is and what
the reliability of the constituent elements

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:54.780
are.

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:56.360
How would you fix the ET?

01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.050
Put shrink wrap all over it.

01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:05.440
Another thing that's not part of the curriculum
here is political systems engineering.

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:09.869
You can have the best engineering design in
the world, but if you don't have the political

01:57:09.869 --> 01:57:13.500
support in a program like this it doesn't
matter.

01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:19.469
How does political influence come into a systems
engineering thing, kind of like the crew escape

01:57:19.469 --> 01:57:19.780
system?

01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:20.080
Thank you.

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:34.150
[APPLAUSE] Well, that was just super.

01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:38.440
This is hopefully the first of many lectures
which will take us to a much greater depth

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:39.700
[then when we did the shuttle system?].

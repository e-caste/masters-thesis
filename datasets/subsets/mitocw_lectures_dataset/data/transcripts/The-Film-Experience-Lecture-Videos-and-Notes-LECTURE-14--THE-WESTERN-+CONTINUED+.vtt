DAVID THORBURN: What I'd
like to do very quickly

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.160
is give you a brief
account-- much

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.490
to skeletal and simplified--
of this conversational drama--

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.980
the way in which the
Western film becomes

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.360
a screen on which American
values are projected,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.800
and on which American
values are tested,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.410
and in which we see American
values or assumptions

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.060
undergoing certain kinds
of transformation--

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.100
certain kinds of change.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.360
I don't expect you to
remember these titles or all

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.443
of these titles although
the ones I talk about you

00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:59.870
might think about.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.800
And this is very far from
a complete list of films.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.060
It's just a list of highlights.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.650
But I want to give
you a sense of,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.610
first-- that the Western film
is at the center of movies

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.330
at every phase of the
history of the medium.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.710
And as we've noted,
one might argue

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.210
that one of the very first
films-- some people have called

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060
it the first narrative
film although that's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.340
a slight exaggeration--
but one of the most

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.770
fundamental founding documents
in the history of movies

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620
is, of course, a Western.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.630
If not its first story-- film--
one of the earliest narrative

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.520
films was a Western.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.450
And we might note, in fact,
that Western, The Great Train

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.240
Robbery, was also
based itself, not

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.840
on-- although it has
mythologized and fictionized--

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.300
The Great Train Robbery is based
on a historical actuality--

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.150
on a robbery that was
very widely covered

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.020
in the press about which
dime novels were written

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.410
and which became a
site of many films--

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.370
the first one The
Great Train Robbery.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.620
A more recent one
that you may have

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.570
heard of if you haven't
actually seen it--

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.060
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid which tells the same story.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.446
It's based on the same gang.

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:15.070
It doesn't tell
exactly the same story,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.800
but it's based on
the same gang that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.150
was said to have committed
the great train robbery.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.360
And that calls our attention
to another factor--

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.600
another aspect-- of
this-- what we might call

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.870
the story of the mythological
aspect of American cinema,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.480
and especially of the Western,
because it calls our attention

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.260
to the fact that the same
events may be narrated again,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.170
and again, and again.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.060
One of the points about myth--
about collective stories--

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.965
is they're literally
told repeatedly.

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:42.840
One way to think about
the Western-- say, OK.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.890
There are variations but,
basically, it's the same story.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.100
Of course, that's a
tremendous simplification

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.580
because it's thematic,
and moral implications

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.710
can change radically--
but, basically,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.060
the same set of characters,
the same setting,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.760
the same materials told over
and over again, obsessively.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.680
Why would a society do this?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.130
What is driven-- what
drives us to do this?

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.810
Well, one answer is there
are pleasures in familiarity.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.620
One of the deepest lessons
of the history of literature

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.050
is that the romantic
and modernest idea

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.687
of the artist as a unique
individual creating art ab

00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:21.170
novo-- sui generis-- with
no connections to the past

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.730
is a fantasy and a delusion--
a particular outgrowth

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.540
of the romantic
and modern period.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.100
But that throughout history and
throughout most cultures, art,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.640
and especially
storytelling, has been

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.590
much more like the activities of
these popular formats in which

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.890
the same kinds of stories
are repeated again

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.940
and again with variations.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.100
And one could say that one of
the profoundest resemblances

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.200
between Shakespeare's
time and our own

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.840
is the dominance of genre
forms in a popular theatrical

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.670
environment.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.970
In Shakespeare's day, it
was the popular theater

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.120
that had a similar effect of
trying to define in some sense

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.350
our notion of national identity.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.950
And that's why I quoted
the Renaissance scholar

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.450
this afternoon who called
Shakespeare's theater

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.790
"the theater of a nation."

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.079
He was trying to make
the same kind of argument

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.050
about the importance
of the centrality

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.880
of the public theater
in Shakespeare's day

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.480
that I'm making about the
movies in the United States

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.320
in the 20th century.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.380
So The Great Train
Robbery is a kind

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.230
of originating text
both for film itself

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.280
and for the genre
of the Western.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.620
Griffith's The Battle
of Elderbush Gulch

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.040
was one of the
first longer films.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.800
I think it was a half an
hour or 45 minutes long.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.760
It was a much longer
creation than earlier films,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.900
and it was one of the
first major examples

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.590
of large crowds of
people-- mounted

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.150
people-- engaged in battle.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.060
And that was one of the
most astonishing things.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.070
It was a tremendously
influential film.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.120
It dramatized battles
between cowboys and Indians

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.090
in a way that showed the
power of the medium of film

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.780
at a very early stage.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.870
In 1914, the first
movie dramatization

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.530
of that novel by Owen Wister
that I mentioned earlier-- that

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.075
was also one of the founding
texts in the Western genre.

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:28.800
I've mentioned a couple
of other films here.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.410
One of them-- one of John
Ford's earliest films

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.050
to demonstrate that--
I've got two Ford films

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.630
listed there to try to give
you a sense of his importance

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.970
in the silent era.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.370
I list The Covered
Wagon as a way

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.700
of showing you that the
genre of the pioneer story

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.460
was already present
in the silent era.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.060
I list The Iron Horse by Ford
as a way of reminding you

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.750
of how central Ford is but
also a way of reminding you

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.550
that that story of the
laying of the railroad--

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.690
the Intercontinental Railroad--
one of the central sub

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.160
stories-- recurring
stories in the Western

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.840
begins in the silent era.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.780
And I mentioned
the Keaton partly

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.760
to show you that the genre had
become so widespread that it

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.550
was now so fully-fledged--
so fully recognizable--

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.050
even in the silent
era that Keaton

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.230
was able to make a comic parody
of Westerns called Go West.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.350
With the advent of
sound, the first decade

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.680
of the Western movie is,
from an artistic standpoint,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.160
not very distinguished.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.060
Can you guess why one
primary reason is?

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.590
If you look, I say singing
cowboys-- because it was sound.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.180
The very first thing
said, oh, well.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.950
We're so enamored of sound.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.210
The novelty of sound
is so remarkable.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.650
The first thing
we'll do is we'll

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.300
introduce cowboys who sing.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.200
And there were primitive
stories that they told,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.245
but the stories were
relatively superficial.

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:01.140
I mentioned In Old
Arizona, the first sound

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.350
Western, in part because what
was amazing about that film,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.860
especially to audiences,
were literally the sounds--

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.920
the crackling of the fire,
the creaking of the saddles.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.670
The noises of the West
were fascinating to people.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.570
So the '30s, from an
artistic standpoint,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.500
were not a very
interesting one in terms

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.681
of the Western's development.

00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:26.510
Some scholars have argued
that the silent Western

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.140
was more interesting than
the Western of the '30s.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.870
But they're worth mentioning
because they were very popular,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.790
and many Westerns in
the '30s were identified

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.160
as what were called B-films.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.790
That is to say, as
you may know the-- I

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.710
wish I had had
time in this course

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.770
to spend some energy talking
about what might be called

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.310
the movie house Culture-- how
incredibly the whole society

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.440
after about 1930 or
in the early '30s

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.860
was permeated by the movies--
how every major city had

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.170
dozens-- maybe even more
than that-- of movie houses

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.640
showing films that--
many levels of films--

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.630
recent films and many
older films as well.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.150
And as I think I mentioned
in an earlier class,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.900
it was possible to go to
third and forth-run movie

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.360
houses showing movies that
were several years old

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.480
and to pay something like
a quarter in the morning

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.560
and go in and watch
five or six movies.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.625
And I did this as a child in
the late '40s in Brooklyn,

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.000
New York where I would go into
a theater and come out-- I

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.416
would go in in the
bright morning.

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:33.960
I would come out--
it would be dark.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.690
They were lousy movies,
but I was a kid.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.190
I didn't know any
better, and it was

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.226
an astonishing kind of culture.

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:42.559
I should also mention, I call
it the movie house culture

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.130
because, of course--
again, I haven't had time

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.850
to develop this.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.880
But if you google "movie
houses," what will immediately

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.200
appear are a series of
magnificent photographs

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.340
or images of movie palaces.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.000
You could even google
"movie palaces"

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.810
and find the same answer-- that
now mostly fallen into disuse

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.590
or destroyed that were
all over the country--

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.580
very exotic and remarkable.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.160
Even the physical
structures of these theaters

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.520
were exotic and exciting.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.680
These exhibition
spaces were themselves

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.590
meant to excite you and
take you into another world.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.570
And partly because of that,
what they always offered

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.000
was a really robust
ticket of offerings.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.390
You didn't just go to the
movies and watch one movie.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.490
You saw at least
a double feature.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.950
The second feature
was often what

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.190
was called a B-movie-- a second
rate movie-- lower budget.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.630
Many of them were Westerns.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.790
One reason for that was
because the accouterments

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.162
of the Western are
so interchangeable.

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.620
As I mentioned in
an earlier class,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.500
one of the things they could
do was use stock footage

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.660
to put these Westerns
together very quickly.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.110
So they could have
a stampede that

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.230
might have appeared in
many different movies

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.920
but will do the job in this
B Western and so forth.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.360
And they could use the
same props, the same town,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.360
the same horses, and the
same costumes, and so forth.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.890
So for a lot of the
'30s, the Western movie

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:10.560
was a kind of back-up-- a second
banana to the primary film.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.830
In addition, there began
to develop, especially

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.030
on Saturday-- in this
movie house culture,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.030
Saturday mornings were
especially for children--

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.152
even Saturday afternoons.

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.360
They began to develop what
they called matinees which

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.550
were intentionally
devoted toward trying

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.330
to get younger people--
children-- into the theaters.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.960
And they had a series of sort
of B or C Westerns some of which

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.560
were serials and would continue
from one Saturday to the next.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.900
I want to mention my favorite
childhood Western hero

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.590
whom I still remember.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.060
And I remember I loved
this character when

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.780
I was seven and eight
years old and would

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.590
go to the movies on Saturdays
and see-- sometimes the serials

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.620
would last several weeks.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.110
Part of it was to try to get
the kids to come back and get

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.206
their parents to pay for them
to come back every Saturday.

00:10:54.206 --> 00:10:56.080
So they would always
end with a cliffhanger--

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.950
with a moment of great
tension-- and you

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.520
wonder whether the
hero and heroin would

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.910
survive into the next week.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.970
And there were a whole
series of such films.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.440
My favorite such
film was a film where

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.810
a series of adventures
starring a character

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.480
named Lash LaRue-- can you
guess what Lash LaRue's weapon

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.490
of choice was?

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.400
AUDIENCE: A whip.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.280
DAVID THORBURN: Yes,
the whip-- a bullwhip.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.504
He never carried a gun.

00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.920
But he had this long bullwhip,
and he would take this whip

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.300
and he'd go--

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:22.870
[CRACK]

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.460
--like that.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.962
And it would snake out across,
and it would flip a gun right

00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:26.920
out of a person's hand.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.260
Or he could go--

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:27.760
[CRACK]

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.370
--like this, and a
little tiny spot of blood

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.450
would appear on a person's nose.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.100
It was a unbelievably,
ridiculous fantasy.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.950
And the lash made a
tremendous beautiful crack

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.140
when he brought it back.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.440
He was obviously a figure
of childhood fantasy,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.010
but it was a tremendously,
memorable film.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.390
And, again, there
was no pretensions

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.960
toward psychological seriousness
or even thematic density

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.890
in these Westerns, but
they permeated the culture.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.920
They were part of the
experience of childhood.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.630
So children in the
society would grow up

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.770
watching these children's
versions of Westerns,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.260
and then they would graduate
to the more adult Westerns.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.770
I don't want to call it a form
of brainwashing because that's

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.200
much too negative
a way of describing

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.480
the way in which these story
forms shape our understandings

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.980
or help to shape
our understandings.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.624
And I don't mean that
human beings are completely

00:12:22.624 --> 00:12:25.040
programmable creatures-- that
they go and look at a movie,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.810
and they become robots
following what the movie said.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.040
But what I am saying is that
the way these kinds of stories

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.050
permeated the society
helped to shape Americans

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.100
understanding of their natures--
of what the social fabric was

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.310
like, of what masculinity
was, of what femininity was,

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.470
of what families were, of what
the relations among the races

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.000
were, of what
American history was,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.770
about what the founding
story of America is,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.940
about what the central
organizing values

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.790
of our culture are.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.990
All of those things are
dramatized either explicitly

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.380
or implicitly in movies.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.320
And because the
movies were so central

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.030
through the 20th
century, they were

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.470
one of the central ways
in which the belief

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.150
system-- the values--
of American society

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.960
were promulgated,
dramatized, rehearsed,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.770
and in some ways
altered and changed.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.570
The classical age
of the Western film

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.764
is often said to be the
period of the 1940s,

00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:25.180
and this is really
the moment when

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.600
the Western as an artistic form
begins to come into its own.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.210
Although, it also still carries
ideological or thematic baggage

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.279
we might not want to
embrace or celebrate.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.070
So remember, it's an
ambivalent thing here.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.280
I'm asking you to respect
the artistry of these films,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.180
but I'm also asking you to do
something mature and grown-up

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.870
which is be skeptical
about the meanings that

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.120
are embodied in what are
sometimes very artful movies.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.590
And we call it
the classical age,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.830
in part, because a
certain kind of much more

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.230
ambitious
intellectually powerful

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.530
and artistically organized
Western begins to appear,

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.950
dominated-- but not completely--
by the great director John

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.310
Ford-- one of whose
masterpieces you're

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.600
going to see in a few minutes.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.450
The age probably begins
in 1939-- the same year

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.810
that the integrated
musical begins

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.960
with-- what was the film?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.370
We mentioned it last week.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.230
The Wizard of Oz
in which color is

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.480
introduced for the first time.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.680
Well, here the genre of the
Western comes into its own,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.310
really, roughly in the
same year in a film that

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.850
stars John Wayne, who was
one of the iconic stars

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.720
of the American Western,
and directed by John Ford--

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.430
his favorite director-- a
director who did other things

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:47.740
but who was noted, especially,
for his remarkable Westerns.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.020
Wayne had had a
career in the movies

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.700
10 years before that, but in
Stagecoach, for the first time,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.295
he became a major star.

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:56.820
The film made him a star.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.650
And Stagecoach is
an interesting film

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.960
because it articulates
or formulates

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.890
one of the great sub
genres within the category

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.690
of the Western.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.760
And this is-- I don't know
exactly what to call it.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.250
It's a story in which you
have a group of unlike people

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.530
who are traveling,
usually by stagecoach

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.980
or in some other-- sometimes it
can be by train-- who are beset

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.565
unexpectedly by some
kind of danger-- usually

00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:22.910
an attack by Indians.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.024
And then the uneasy
community that

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:26.440
is forced upon
them when they have

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.410
to defend themselves reveals
various aspects of human nature

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.800
and of human society.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.870
And the film Stagecoach
is a classic instance

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.550
of that in which the
John Wayne character gets

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:43.980
on the stagecoach as
it's making a journey

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.800
across a bleak Western landscape
through Indian territory.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.770
And he's a, kind
of, ambiguous figure

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.770
in this film-- the Wayne
character-- perhaps an outlaw.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.195
And the respectable
people who are

00:15:55.195 --> 00:15:58.140
in the stagecoach-- a
banker-- a character who's

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.490
actually embezzling money
and is trying to get away

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.440
although no one knows.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.790
He hasn't revealed
it at the time.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.456
It comes out in the
course of the film--

00:16:04.456 --> 00:16:06.275
and a series of other
sort of characters

00:16:06.275 --> 00:16:07.650
with interesting
backgrounds that

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.460
emerge when the catastrophe
descends upon them.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.890
And, of course, what happens
is the ambiguity of the Wayne

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.630
character-- the fact that
he has a kind of connection

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.814
to lawlessness turns out to
be one of the great virtues

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.230
that he has because,
of course, he

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.400
becomes the primary defender
of the group when they

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.650
are beset by savage Indians.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.984
And then I've listed--
again, let me remind you.

00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:34.150
Again, I've just picked--
these are just highlights.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.440
Remember what we said.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.820
Nearly 30% of all films
made during the studio era

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.760
were Western movies, and these
are among the highlights.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.020
From the titles you can
see the recurring sub

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.030
genres that occur.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.700
Billy the Kid in 1941-- the
film directed by David Miller--

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.610
this preoccupation with outlaws.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.670
There are a number of
films about Billy the Kid,

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.130
a number of films
about Jesse James,

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:06.419
and about the gun fight
at the O.K. Corral.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.460
The 1946 film My Darling
Clementine-- Ford's famous film

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.400
starring Henry Fonda-- is one
of six movies made about the gun

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.869
fight at the O.K. Corral.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.667
And think of what
that says to us.

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:21.500
What does a myth do?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.060
It tells the same story
again, and again, and again.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.490
Each of those six
films is in many ways

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.020
different from-- in
significant ways,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.524
each film is different
from the other film

00:17:31.524 --> 00:17:33.440
even though the basic
information, or at least

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.700
the basic situation,
is the same.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.350
And, in fact, in some
versions of the film--

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.140
in some versions
of that account--

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.850
the account of the O.K.
Corral-- Wyatt Earp

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.240
and the Earp brothers fight
against the Clanton brothers.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.560
In the classic
versions-- in the version

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.330
My Darling Clementine in 1946
by Ford, the Earps are heroes.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.320
And Wyatt Earp is
a great American--

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.220
is a noble American hero who
defends a town against anarchy

00:17:59.220 --> 00:17:59.910
and evil.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.530
The Clantons are entirely evil.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.640
But in later revisionist
versions of the same story,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.830
Earp and his brothers are
seen as arrogant officials who

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.580
are trying to control
gambling and prostitution

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.480
in the town of Tombstone.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.390
And the Clantons are
not seen as noble

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.890
but are seen,
essentially, as rivals

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.990
of the Earps-- not necessarily
as inferior, evil characters.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.590
And such a
perspective, of course,

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.620
profoundly changes
our understanding

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.030
of what the gun fight
at the O.K. Corral

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:35.130
represented-- interesting
and deeply revealing

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.270
that so many Westerns
have been repeated.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.090
I mean, the same story
told again and again.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.890
And so the fact that the
gunfighter at the O.K. Corral

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.270
was repeated at least six times
in feature length films-- there

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.230
were also television versions
of the O.K. Corral event,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.840
adding to the number--
is a dramatic example

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.210
of what we might call
this mythological function

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.900
or this forum function--
this discourse space

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.190
function that genre forms in
general and the Western movie,

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.920
in particular, have.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.950
I've already mentioned Red
River in my earlier discourse

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.210
about Howard Hawks.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.870
And I want to just remind
you that that great director

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.560
of screwball comedy was also
one of the great directors

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.700
of masculine adventure
films including what

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.200
many people think is one of the
great Westerns of all time--

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.010
Red River.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.220
And Red River is an
interesting sub genre as well.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.860
It's a cattle drive Western.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.920
Many Westerns are
about cattle drive,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.490
but this one also adds a
very interesting complexity

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.620
because there's a
kind of oedipal drama

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.500
and acted out between the
John Wayne figure-- recurring

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.110
figure in so many Westerns--
and a younger man played

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.284
by the great actor Montgomery
Clift who plays a surrogate son

00:19:47.284 --> 00:19:48.450
to the John Wayne character.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.110
And, of course,
conflict develops

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:55.120
and the rivalry
between father and son

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.310
is a fundamental subplot
in that remarkable Western.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.310
One other thing I should say
about the '40s period-- I

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.720
call it the classical age
primarily for this reason--

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.110
I sort of didn't name this.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.790
Forgive me for not
mentioning this earlier.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.660
Again, we're talking
about the period

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.290
just before, during, and
after the Second World War.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.230
The United States feels
itself to be beleaguered.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.510
The world is
beleaguered in a way.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.270
That outer reality
also helps to explain

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.230
why the Western of
the 1940s would be,

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:32.330
essentially, a celebration
of American power,

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.370
a celebration of
American empire,

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.625
a celebration of
American know-how

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:40.230
and competence in the
wilderness because, by analogy,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.660
the Western is a story
of American success--

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.520
of American conquest.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.860
One might think of it
as a story that American

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.860
needed to tell itself
during the period.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.600
So the war-- the
Second World War

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.570
is a great reinforcement
to the way in which--

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.370
in the classical age of
the American Western,

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.500
the Western film is basically
telling an heroic story,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.025
is celebrating the
conquest of the West,

00:21:05.025 --> 00:21:07.540
and is seeing the white
man's settlement of the West

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.070
in relatively unambiguously,
admirable terms, celebrating

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.240
the courage, and the resilience,
and the physical prowess

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.230
of the pioneers and the
great, noble gun fighters

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.100
who tamed the West for us.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.460
But by the 1950s, this
confidence has begun to wane.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.290
Part of it is, look--
the war has been over

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.040
for a significant time.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.860
American society is
in a peacetime boom

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.430
which is going to
build through the '50s.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.310
And it's also a period in
which a certain kind of-- this

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.520
was, of course, the
period of my childhood.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.070
I was 10 years old in 1950.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.600
And I remember it vividly.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.380
In fact, saw some
of the films that

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.120
are listed here in the
theaters for the first time.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.370
So I mention that to you just to
remind you that, in fact, what

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.620
we're talking about is
not ancient history at all

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.630
because I actually
experienced some of the films

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.200
on this list in my
own actual lifetime

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.750
when they were originally
shown in the theaters.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.170
And although I am infinitely
old compared to you guys,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.390
I'm still a vigorous,
functioning human being.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.430
So within my lifetime's
memory, many of these films

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.190
were contemporary.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.150
And it's important to
realize how close we

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.730
are, in fact, to these times.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.120
But one of things that
begin to appear in the 1950s

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.655
was a kind of skepticism
about the social arrangements

00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:30.280
in the society.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.150
At first they were
very modest and mild.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.280
There was in the
1950s, for example,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.604
what came to be called a
generation gap in which older

00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:39.270
and younger-- in which
there was thought

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.090
to be a distance between
older and younger people.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:47.170
And there was a great concern
in the 1950s for alienated youth

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.690
and juvenile delinquency which
was a great catch phrase.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.650
And some of the films of
the 1950s dramatized that.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.880
For example, the film
The Left-Handed Gun

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.050
in 1958 starring Paul Newman--
directed by Arthur Penn--

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.290
is a story really about--
it's a Billy the Kid story.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.790
Newman plays a Billy
the Kid type character,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.970
but he plays a young boy.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.690
He plays, really,
a post adolescent.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.010
And you can feel that what's
partly being dramatized

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.900
there are teenage angst.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.410
There are-- and
what also begins--

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.900
in 1952, the film High Noon--
a fragment of which I will show

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.410
in next week's lecture when
we talk about McCabe and Mrs.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.400
Miller to do a contrast
with a classical Western

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:40.300
and a post-classical
Western-- that film introduces

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.620
certain kinds of contemporary
political concerns.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.220
Many people see High Noon as
a parable about the McCarthy

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.110
era-- Senator Joseph
McCarthy and the fear

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.410
of-- the paranoia
about communism

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.250
and the anti-communist
hysteria of

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.180
the late '40s and early 1950s
when the Cold War was just

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.220
getting powerfully started.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.440
And High Noon is a kind of
parable about a good man who

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.720
turns to-- a sheriff
played by Gary Cooper--

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.110
one of the great iconic
heroes of masculinity

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.170
of the classical Hollywood
era along with John Wayne.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.632
And Cooper plays a sheriff who
has brought peace to the town.

00:24:16.632 --> 00:24:18.090
He's been a sheriff
for many years.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.440
And on his wedding day, he's
marrying a Quaker-- a Quaker

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:21.940
woman.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.010
He's giving up his gun
because a Quaker woman, played

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.480
by Grace Kelly-- you'll remember
her from the Hitchcock film

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.810
although here she
plays a Western heroin.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.970
She's a Quaker, and he's putting
down his gun to join his wife.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.000
And on his wedding day a
man that he sent to jail

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.739
is coming back by the noonday
train to take his revenge.

00:24:41.739 --> 00:24:44.280
So the Sheriff spends the early
part of the film going around

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.380
to the townspeople--
a town that owes

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.480
its life to this great, heroic
sheriff saying, help me.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.480
I'm going to be attacked by
Frank Miller and his gang.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.590
No one will help him.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.280
He's left on his own.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.090
He has to stand by himself
because the town is

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.200
too cowardly.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.630
And it's a parable
of the cowardice

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.640
of people who deserted--
it's in some sense a,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.270
kind of, left wing argument.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.890
It's a parable
about the cowardice

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.820
of people who wouldn't stand
up for folks who were attacked

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.380
by Senator McCarthy and
other anti-communists

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.150
for being disloyal.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.350
So certain kinds of
political meanings

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.030
begin to-- skeptical political
meanings begin to creep in.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:28.010
And the society that's
dramatized in High Noon

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.780
is hardly an admirable society.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.180
The Western culture may
have created a town,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.280
and the town has a church.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.780
And they have a meeting
in the church in the film.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.740
He goes-- it's a Sunday, and
you can hear the church bells.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.900
And he goes to the church,
and he asks for help

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.310
from the congregation.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.640
And they won't do it.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.770
They're too cowardly.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:57.000
And so it's a parable
about cowardice,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.020
and about political dysfunction,
and about communal disloyalty.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:11.400
Also, already by the 1950s,
before the Hollywood era

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.320
has completely concluded
or been obliterated--

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.340
Hollywood dominance is still
significant in the 1950s--

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.140
the Western has begun to change.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.510
It's begun to reflect
social changes as well

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.740
as thematic or
ideological changes that

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.320
have to do with the way
the society is altering

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.900
after the Second World War.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.460
And a number of the films
that I've listed there

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.410
do that kind of thing.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.780
And one can also see in this
listing of so-called adult

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.310
Westerns a greater emphasis
on psychological themes--

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.870
on the conflict
between individuals.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.230
One very powerful and
interesting instance

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.790
of that is a film in 1967
directed by Martin Ritt,

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.600
starring the great Paul
Newman, in which Newman

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.420
plays a half white,
half Spanish,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.200
or half Indian character.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.800
I think he's an Indian--
a Native American.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.290
And it's a parable about racism.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.450
The Newman character is
angry at both the white

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.295
and the Native American society.

00:27:16.295 --> 00:27:17.530
He doesn't fit in any place.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.700
But it's especially a
parable about his exclusion,

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.620
about the Paul Newman
character's exclusion

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.980
from white society, and
about the power of racism.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.106
By the time we get to
the end of the 1960s,

00:27:33.106 --> 00:27:34.480
we're beginning
to get films that

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.880
have a kind of violence quotient
that's different, and bloodier,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.070
and more disturbing
than the violence we

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.900
saw during the classical age.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.180
And we especially associate
this form of violence

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.670
with the director Sam
Peckinpah whose film in 1969,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.940
The Wild Bunch, takes
a number of actors

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.950
who had been stars
in classic Westerns

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.170
and brings them back in a
Western that is much darker

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.480
and shows these older
men as-- first of all,

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.545
their age is emphasized.

00:28:04.545 --> 00:28:05.920
They're sort of
doddering around.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.990
They're my age.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.520
They're in their
late 60s-- early 70s,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.700
and they don't seem as
vigorous as they should be,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.437
for one thing.

00:28:12.437 --> 00:28:14.020
I think there are
even scenes in which

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.520
their nearsightedness of one of
the characters is dramatized.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.180
But their age and
trembliness is only a part

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.710
of their unheroic dimensions.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:27.560
And we can see that the
film, although it celebrates

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.430
these heroes in a certain way--
the celebration is cankered.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.780
It's damaged.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.830
It's a damaged kind
of celebration.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.141
There's a sense that these
men are past their prime,

00:28:38.141 --> 00:28:39.640
that they're sleeping
with women who

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.300
are far too young with them,
and there's something kind

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.570
of disgusting about that.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:48.900
We see that one of
the actors-- an older

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.490
figure-- Robert Ryan--
a very gifted actor who

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.110
was in many, many
Westerns and other films

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.070
in the classical
age of Hollywood--

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.920
plays an agent and very
effective gunfighter.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.870
There's a terrible scene in a
brothel where he's-- she's not

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.670
a teenager, but there's a woman
surely 30 years younger than he

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.080
who becomes his bedmate.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.469
And there's something sour about
the scene intended, I think,

00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:15.135
by the director.

00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:16.480
I mean, you can feel it.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.440
It's as if the
Western values have

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.940
begun to congeal and sicken
even before we get to the-- what

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.520
I'm calling the-- anti-Western.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.200
And, of course, in the
late '60s there also

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.640
begins to emerge the
phenomenon I talked about

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.730
earlier this afternoon--
how the Italians start

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.980
making Westerns--
putting them in Italian

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.390
and they find
locations in Europe

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.850
that replicate American
deserts and so forth.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.180
And the Italian Westerns,
especially those

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.460
that are associated
with Sergio Leone,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.140
have a dark, existential,
almost nihilistic flavor.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.560
And one of the things that Leone
did that was very subversive.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.700
He took characters--
American actors--

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.830
who were associated with
great, heroic, idealistic roles

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.850
in American Westerns
of the '40s and '50s,

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.310
and he put them into
Westerns in which they played

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.780
evil villains--
murderers criminals who

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.880
had no compassion or pity
for any of their victims.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.310
And there's something shocking
about seeing noble Henry

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:21.100
Fonda who played young Abe
Lincoln in John Ford's movie

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:27.730
and played so many wonderful,
heroic figures including

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:33.350
Wyatt Earp in My Darling
Clementine suddenly turned

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.430
into a stone killer.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.280
And that kind of
reversal anticipates

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.700
what happens in the 1970s.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.940
And, of course, what happens
in the '70s-- partly,

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.550
again, a consequence
of transformations

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.080
in American society.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.970
I'll talk a bit about
the cultural history

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.590
of the '70s next week when I
talk about film in the '70s

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.720
in a systematic way.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.470
But suffice it to
say for now, that

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.910
what goes on there is
a series of Westerns

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.940
begin to appear
that are permeated

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.820
by the anti-establishment values
of the counterculture-- that

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.450
are permeated by the
anti-war movement--

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.280
because the era of the Vietnam
War-- of tremendous fissures

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.320
in American society.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.156
I'll talk more about
this next week,

00:31:18.156 --> 00:31:19.530
so I don't want
to repeat myself.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:21.710
So it's a period in
which American culture

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.230
is-- it's conflicted and
divided in a horrific way.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.210
And the Westerns will
begin to reflect that.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.430
And, in fact, the
old heroic enterprise

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.010
of the classic Westerns of
the 1940s and early '50s

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.520
is suddenly
transformed in a series

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.830
of anti-Westerns or
dissenting Westerns.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.160
In 1970, Ralph
Nelson makes a film

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.170
called Soldier Blue in which
the American cavalry, the heroes

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.130
of so many films including
a trilogy of films

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.640
by John Ford made
in the late '40s

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.750
called the Cavalry Trilogy
in which-- John Wayne is

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.090
in one of those films.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.520
At least one of those
films celebrates

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.680
the American-- the blue-suited
cavalry of the Western era.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:12.090
In Ralph Nelson's film,
the American soldiers

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.900
are the enemy.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.910
It's almost-- and
they commit atrocities

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.580
that some scholars have
associated with the My Lai

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.590
atrocities in Vietnam.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.840
And so the Western
has become a screen

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.170
on which America's anxieties
about the Vietnam War

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.250
have been projected.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.510
Why would the Western
work so well for this?

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.160
One answer is what
I've been saying

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.920
all along about
the power of genre

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.100
and the power of repetition.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.130
Look, if a thing is
repeated again, and again,

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.540
and again, it looks familiar.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.040
When it's so familiar,
what happens?

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.780
It licenses
something disturbing.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.650
Because the genre
seems on the surface

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.730
to contain so many familiar,
reassuring elements,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.590
those very elements
of reassurance

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.160
enable the exploration of
disturbing, or uncertain,

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.630
or problematic materials.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.460
And that's one of
the-- and, of course,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.570
because any one of these
films would have nothing

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.340
like the power
they actually have

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.970
if they existed individually.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.910
But it's because they're part
of this long conversation that

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.010
goes back to the
earliest days of movies

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.230
that they have the
power that they have.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.550
In 1971, the film starring
Dustin Hoffman, Little Big Man,

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.190
is another such
film in which it's

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.840
the Indians-- the Native
Americans-- who are the heroes.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.340
And the little, big
man of the title

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.600
is played by Dustin Hoffman.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.720
He's a Native American who
has survived Indian massacres

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.140
and lives to tell the story.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.440
And, of course,
in 1971-- the film

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.270
you'll see next week that
will embody these principles--

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.510
Robert Altman's McCabe
and Mrs. Miller.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.020
The Western doesn't disappear.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.440
It doesn't completely
die, but it falls away

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.720
as time continues
in part, I think,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.710
because our increasingly
urbanized society

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.830
after the 1950s became
less and less amenable.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:02.184
The Western became less and
less credible or valuable.

00:34:02.184 --> 00:34:04.100
It became harder and
harder for most Americans

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.170
to identify with
aspects of the Western.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:06.920
That's one reason.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.409
And other genres begin to take
over, especially the science

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:11.118
fiction genre.

00:34:11.118 --> 00:34:12.909
And one of the things
you might think about

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:15.909
if you think about the
rise of science fiction

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.104
from the '50s and '60s, and
then especially from the '70s

00:34:19.104 --> 00:34:21.520
and beyond, and especially the
rise of the science fiction

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.659
film is you can begin to
see a hybridization going on

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.739
in which many of the
features of the Western

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:30.170
are superimposed on a
science fiction format.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.500
And, man, I'm sure you can
think of many such examples

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.219
of science fiction
films they borrow from

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:42.070
and utilize Western conventions.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.750
So that's one feature-- that
certain kinds of hybridization

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.540
in which some of the
features of a Western

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.400
begin to appear in other genres.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.840
But, of course, the Western--
because of the resonance

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.590
of the form, it
continues to be a space

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.090
in which gifted directors
are able to make statements

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.170
about the nature of
American society.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.045
And exactly, again, because
of the familiarity of it

00:35:03.045 --> 00:35:07.730
and because of the long history
of the themes and discourses

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.080
we associate with the
Western, every new Western

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.650
is always implicitly
in a conversation

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:13.770
with its ancestors.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.240
And we have in the 1990s a
series of interesting films.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.580
Some of you may have seen them--
Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven,

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.330
Kevin Costner's
Dances with Wolves,

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.490
two more versions of
the Wyatt Earp story--

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:30.310
Tombstone and Wyatt Earp.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:36.270
Just a couple of titles from
more recent times-- in 2007,

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:41.460
3:10 to Yuma-- a remake
of an earlier film that I

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.770
listed earlier-- a 1957 film.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.560
If you compare
those two films, you

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.860
can see how much more violent,
how much more anarchic,

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.820
how much less idealizing and
romanticizing the Western

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.350
has become.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.280
The Assassination of Jesse James
by the Coward Robert Ford--

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.270
a wonderful title
which replicates

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.540
exactly the title of
one of those dime novels

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.500
appeared in 2007.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.530
And let me mention
two astonishingly

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.060
rich and interesting
examples from television.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.940
Television by the '80s
and '90s is already

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.800
a rival to the
movies-- has really

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.780
replaced the movies in many
ways in terms of complexity

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.970
and richness as well as having
replaced the movies somewhat

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.100
earlier as our consensus
form-- as our central form.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:30.130
But two films, especially--
one, the well-known miniseries

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.360
Lonesome Dove made from
the Larry McMurtry novel--

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.730
one of the best television--
one of the best Westerns

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.460
ever made-- a wonderful
multipart story

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.100
utilizing the serial
nature of television

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.320
to tell a Western with an
expansiveness that the movie

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.750
screen can allow but that
the conditions of exhibition

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.539
in the movies do not allow.

00:36:50.539 --> 00:36:51.830
You can't go back to the movie.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.780
You can't watch a movie for
six hours or eight hours.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.180
And it's much less
convenient to go once a week

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.880
for two hours for seven or eight
weeks to see the same story.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.520
Television's a
perfect environment

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.370
for that in that sense.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:07.520
The reduced visual
scale of television

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.870
is what keeps the television
from being really as

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.790
powerful a medium for the
Western as the movies are.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.420
But still, great
Westerns are made.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.010
And the greatest
of all television

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.720
Westerns-- one of the great
Westerns-- one of the greatest

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.310
Westerns ever made-- is the
ongoing series-- David Milch's

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.860
great series,
Deadwood, that appeared

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.140
on HBO from 2004 to
2006 was abruptly

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.540
cut-off by the HBO bosses.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.720
In my view, it's the equivalent
in the history of television

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.940
to the story of what happened
to the Last Laugh, in which

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.380
the producers damaged
a work of art.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.230
But even in its
damaged form, Deadwood

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.250
is one of the most remarkable
Westerns ever made.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:53.430
And it is deeply, deeply,
deeply anarchic, dissenting,

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.840
skeptical about human
values and about motives.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.340
It's the opposite of
an idealizing Western.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.950
It sees the West as
emerging-- and Western society

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:09.210
as emerging from human greed,
from entrepreneuring violence

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.975
and viciousness, from fear.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.230
From a historical and
intellectual standpoint,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.220
it's a far more
persuasive understanding

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.000
of how history evolves, I think,
than earlier idealizing forms--

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.950
a deeply disturbing
and powerful text.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:30.266
So the Western remains even
in its vestigial condition--

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:31.390
even though it's now faded.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.550
It's no longer as
central a format

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.380
for an urbanized and
technologized society.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.110
Remember, the United States
before the Second World War

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.570
was mostly a rural society.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:45.400
We only became a suburban
and a fully urban society

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.970
after the Second World War.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.935
And the growth of the
suburbs is the great event,

00:38:49.935 --> 00:38:51.310
of course, after
the Second World

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:56.100
War-- so that more and
more of the population

00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.190
found rural spaces alien, and
didn't grow up in big spaces,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.660
and couldn't identify
in the same way

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.730
with the Western story.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.020
And the conditions of
experience-- the conditions

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.560
of life in the United States--
underwent a transformation

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:14.745
that made the Western much
more of a traditional--

00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:18.370
a vestigial voice-- a vestigial
form than a central one.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:23.890
And we can trace the progress
of that-- of the Western genre's

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.540
movement-- from the center
to the more marginal

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.850
or peripheral parts of the
society in this history

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.870
that I've briefly shown you.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.165
I have a few things to
say about John Ford.

00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:35.280
Can you put him up?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.440
I won't spend a lot
of time on this,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.400
but I want to mention
some things about him.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.470
This is a list of some
of his significant films.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.520
Not all that I've listed
here are Westerns,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.440
but you can see a
number of them are.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.210
He begins in the silent era.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.810
He continues robustly
through the sound era--

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.880
one of the great directors
of the sound era.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:06.850
And you can see a film like
Young Mr. Lincoln is not

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.780
quite a Western.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.610
Drums Along the Mohawk--
half a Western-- but he

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.770
made other films that
were not Westerns.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.920
But the Western was
his signature form.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.640
He was a very unpretentious man.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.980
And when he was introduced
to people he often said,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.280
hello, I'm John Ford.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.420
I direct Westerns.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.250
I make Westerns.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.230
He didn't say, I'm
a film director.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.825
He didn't say, I'm a cineaste.

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:31.590
He didn't say, I'm an
artist in the movies.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.540
He said, I make Westerns.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:41.420
And I like the unpretentious
of that quality in him.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.540
He was the 13th child of Irish
immigrants-- born in Maine.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.490
His father was a saloon owner.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.100
And at the age of 18, in
1913 after high school,

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.000
he followed his brother
Jack to Hollywood

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.920
where his brother was a
writer and a director.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.060
He began to work in
his brothers films

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.000
as a prop man, and a stunt
man, and a bit actor.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.500
He played a Ku Klux Klansman
in The Birth of a Nation.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.400
So he's a man who's
the first-- why

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.190
is Birth of a Nation important?

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.680
The first feature-length film
in the United States-- D.W.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.410
Griffith.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:22.000
And it shows Ford's connection
to the history-- centrality

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.430
to the history of
the American film.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.190
And he directed his
first film in 1917

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.910
which was a bank
robbery Western.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.990
And in that year he
directed his first feature--

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:38.020
the film I listed earlier
on our little history

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.230
of the Western,
Straight Shooting.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:47.670
And then a series of films
through his career-- 30

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:52.410
silent films by 1921 nearly
all of which have been lost.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.130
So he was a very prolific
director in the silent era.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.050
And, finally, at the
end of his career

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.570
he had directed more
than 100 films--

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:05.990
over 60 sound features, 14
Westerns of which at least five

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:10.250
to seven are among the
greatest Westerns ever made.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.040
I won't single out any
particular films here

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.240
except to indicate that by the
time we get to the late '50s--

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.240
to The Searchers, The Man Who
Shot Liberty Valance, Cheyenne

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.500
Autumn, Seven Women-- a
new kind of skepticism

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.800
has entered into the idealizing
and heroic tendencies that

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.000
were characteristic of Ford's
work in his earlier Westerns.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.580
And one of the reasons
that the film you're

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.120
going to see tonight
is so central

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.630
is that it may be Ford's most
profoundly ambivalent Western--

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:46.120
the Western in which
his impulse to celebrate

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.450
the heroic qualities
of these pioneers

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:53.040
and the resilience and
survival qualities that

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.160
were required to survive
in these environments

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.840
are very central.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.300
But he's begun to
recognize-- begun

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.680
to acknowledge-- what
his earlier films had not

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.480
acknowledged-- the moral
complexities of the idea

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.350
that the whites should
come and take land

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.500
away from the Indians.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.900
He's become to realize that
the settlement of the West

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.620
is not an unambiguous, triumphal
story but a more complex

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.690
and morally ambiguous tale.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.270
And that moral ambiguity
is at the heart of the film

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.760
you're going to see
tonight-- The Searchers.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.210
It has a damaged hero
as you'll recognize.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.326
It's probably John
Wayne's greatest role.

00:43:31.326 --> 00:43:32.700
John Wayne-- he
plays a character

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.130
named Ethan in the film.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.110
And it's interesting--
maybe Wayne didn't fully

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:40.170
understand how ambivalently
the central character is

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.420
treated because he named
his firstborn son Ethan.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.280
It's a strange thing
because the Ethan

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.470
that John Wayne plays
here is not really

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:48.800
an attractive person.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.900
He has qualities that we admire
and that John Ford surely

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.740
admires.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.460
He's tremendously
good with a gun.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.490
He's deeply knowledgeable about
how to survive in the West.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.560
He knows a tremendous amount
about the Native Americans.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.240
He can ride a horse
like a rodeo rider.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.060
He's brave beyond belief, but
he's also, as we discover,

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.191
a racist.

00:44:11.191 --> 00:44:13.065
There's a danger all
the way through the film

00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:17.400
that he may murder the young
girl he's trying to find.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.196
He's searching for a young girl.

00:44:19.196 --> 00:44:20.570
There's some
question all the way

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.440
through the film on what his
motive is-- whether he wants

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.680
to find her to kill
her or whether he wants

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.190
to find her to rescue her.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:27.750
Why does he want to kill her?

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.305
Part of his damage--
the implication

00:44:29.305 --> 00:44:31.430
of the early part of the
film is that he-- not just

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.820
the implication--
the fact is he--

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.195
in the early part
of the film, we

00:44:34.195 --> 00:44:38.220
discover that he fought on the
Confederate side of the war,

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.820
so he's coming home a loser.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.570
And there's an implication
very early, as you'll see,

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.380
that he committed
various kinds of crime--

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.960
that he rode with outlaws.

00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:54.780
And that some of the loot
that he has taken from the war

00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:00.740
may be ill-gained-- that he's a
bitter and unhappy war veteran

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.550
who feels that his side lost.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.380
So he enters the film bitter--
as an embittered and damaged

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.020
person.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.150
As the film continues,
we recognize

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.030
that, in fact, this family he's
returned to-- his brother's

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.990
family and his brother's wife
and his nieces and nephews--

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.740
there's a complexity there
because of the looks that he

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.890
exchanges with his
brother's wife.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.430
You realize, not that they've
ever had an affair or anything,

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.260
but they had loved
each other first

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.122
and that the wife maybe still
loves the John Wayne character

00:45:29.122 --> 00:45:30.580
even though she'll
never act on it.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.030
Watch how that happens
because not a word of dialogue

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.890
is spoken, but Ford dramatizes
this almost heavy-handedly.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:41.482
It's not all ambiguous even
though the character playing

00:45:41.482 --> 00:45:43.690
John Wayne's brother is
completely oblivious to this,

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.280
but the audience knows this.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.320
So he's an embittered,
damaged-- a partial figure even

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.400
from the beginning.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.790
And then as the
story goes on, we

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.440
discover other qualities in
him that make us nervous.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.410
I said, for example,
that he may be a racist.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.100
And we don't know whether
he'll kill or save

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.010
the person he's after.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.490
The film involves
an Indian attack

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:08.820
in which the John
Wayne character's niece

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.140
is taken by Indians.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.470
And most of the film is
the John Wayne character

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.040
and his sidekick's
attempt to recover

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.690
the stolen woman-- his niece.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.270
She's stolen as a child,
but it takes many years

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.560
before they recover her.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.810
And by the time they recover
her, she's a young woman.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.160
And she's been the wife
of an Indian brave--

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.610
a character named Scar who
was really, ultimately,

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:35.430
a kind of double of the
hero in certain ways

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:40.420
as we come to recognize when
we look closely at the film.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:48.970
And his search for this
girl is ambiguous to us

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:52.180
because he's so against--
he hates Indian so much.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.920
It's a form of-- remember when
the film is taking place--

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.280
during the civil rights era.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.110
So we can read John
Wayne's hatred of Indians

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:06.080
as a form of the racism--
the anti-African American

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.725
prejudice-- that is
being dramatized--

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:11.640
that is being fought
over in the civil rights

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.670
movement in the United
States in the '50s and 1960s.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.010
So it's a kind of metaphor
for what's happening there.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.292
And we're not sure whether
the John Wayne character

00:47:20.292 --> 00:47:22.000
is actually going to
save her or kill her

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.110
when he finds her because she's
been polluted by her connection

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.210
to an Indian.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:31.700
And this theme-- it's not
hidden because the John Wayne

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.060
character's sidekick is really
worried about this and even

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.940
accuses him of
this at some point.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.440
So he's a damaged and
ambiguous character.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.290
There are things
about him we admire,

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:43.260
but there are things
about him that disturb us.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.260
And at the very end
of the film in what

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.780
is one of the most famous
images in John Ford's work,

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.640
we get a shot of John
Wayne from the back.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.830
He's been excluded from
the community in a way.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.070
We see him from the back.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.290
He's standing like this.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:00.260
We see him through an
aperture through a doorway.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.460
And he grabs his-- he makes
this kind of a gesture--

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.490
a gesture of vulnerability in
which we-- and he's standing

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.720
isolated and alone.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.440
There's a sense in which he's
still-- this extraordinary hero

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.847
has been, in some
sense, excluded

00:48:12.847 --> 00:48:14.430
from the very community
that he helped

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:18.420
create, in part,
because he doesn't

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.750
deserve to be part of it.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:20.530
He's damaged.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.750
He's imperfect.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:26.720
But also because of the
natural-- the mythic logic

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.350
of the Western in which
the savior figure is so

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.680
tainted by the
savagery he saved us

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.115
from that he can't be
included in the community

00:48:34.115 --> 00:48:35.550
that he helped to create.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.900
So it's a very clear example
of this Western pattern,

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.230
but it's morally
complicated because it

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.300
comes at such a late stage
and because, by this time,

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.320
Ford himself has
begun to reflect

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.830
on the implications of the
much more simplistic stories

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.520
he had told earlier
in his career.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.600
The setting of the film
is important to talk about

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.600
because it is filmed
in a place that

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.160
came to be called John
Wayne's own special theater--

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.430
his own stage set--
Monument Valley in Arizona.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.480
Other directors have
worked in that place,

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.960
but it always feels as if
they're plagiarizing John Ford.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.540
He made at least nine
films in Monument Valley.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.310
And you'll see the
power of that space--

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:19.760
the looming rock
formations-- the sense you

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.780
have all the way through the
film that the human habitations

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:27.840
are minimal structures that
could be blown away in a second

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.500
and that are dwarfed in
comparison to the rock

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:38.540
formations and the grandeur of
the gigantic natural phenomena

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.730
that we see around us.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.990
The human being seems small,
and the human habitations

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:46.600
seem marginal and
far from permanent

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.760
in this world of
grandeur-- of what

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.090
we might call inhuman grandeur.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:53.700
So the setting's important.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.810
The plot-- very
important to realize

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:59.310
that it embodies two separate,
important kinds of stories.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.070
The first-- the founding story--
what I've talked about earlier

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:02.620
today.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.700
The idea that this is
how a culture is founded.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.970
You create a society
against warring elements,

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:14.150
rescue it from the
wilderness, and from savage--

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.590
not just savage nature but
from savage antagonists--

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.180
the American Indians who don't
want to give up their land

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.040
and who are-- until we get
to this film-- in John Ford's

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.390
films mostly-- had been
figured as anarchic figures

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.140
of pure evil.

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.690
They hadn't been humanized.

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:33.200
They've been seen
as part of nature.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.460
In this film, not so.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.890
There's a sympathy
for the Indians

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:39.010
that enters this film that
helps to explain its complexity

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.230
and its richness.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:42.780
The second great story is
the captive's tale-- one

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.680
of the central and earliest
forms of American narrative.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.130
The captives tale that is told
here is based on a true story.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:52.270
A woman named Cynthia Ann Parker
was abducted at the age of nine

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:56.900
by Comanches in Texas in 1836.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.520
A novel was written
about that event

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.940
by Alan Le May much
after the event.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.900
And Ford's film is
based on the novel.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.850
One of the ironies is
that the real Cynthia

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:15.960
Ann chose her Comanche husband
over her Anglo relatives

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.610
when she was rescued.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.740
She didn't want to
leave unlike the novel

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.180
and unlike what
happens in the film.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.570
And I mention this,
in part, to remind you

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:30.200
of the romanticizing tendencies
of the American Western.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.780
But still, captives'
tales-- stories

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.480
of white people,
especially white women,

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.930
captured by Indians
and raised by Indians

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:42.750
were a staple of
the popular cultures

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.160
from long before the
history of movies.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.150
And this movie,
like other movies,

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.997
dramatizes a version
of that captive's tale.

00:51:49.997 --> 00:51:52.330
The structure of the film is
worth calling attention to,

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:53.930
in part, because it's ambiguous.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.370
One way to organize
the plot-- I mean,

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:00.591
the structure of the
film-- is to recognize

00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:03.090
that there are seven moments
in the film that we might think

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.420
of as chapters or bookmarks.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.420
And if you watch
for these moments--

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.517
it's also a structurally
significant device.

00:52:10.517 --> 00:52:12.100
If you watch for
these moments, you'll

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.600
be able to follow the-- you'll
recognize that the film is

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.640
progressing because its
timeframe is intentionally

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.420
ambiguous for reasons
I'll hint at in a moment.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.230
And these seven moments all
involve a similar kind of shot.

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.060
The camera looks through
a doorway or an opening

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.220
out into a rectangle
of receding light.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.690
The very opening of the
film has one such shot.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.340
And at seven different
moments in the film,

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.420
we see a shot from inside
an interior space--

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.430
from a dark interior space-- and
we look out through a doorway.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.430
You might ask yourself why
in a film that celebrates

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.480
and that dramatizes the
immense expansiveness

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.850
of the Western environment,
Ford would give us

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:56.360
images-- such self-conscious
obvious images--

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.310
that, first of all,
refer to each other

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.390
so you think about when
they occur in the film.

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.350
But why he would
so intentionally

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:05.700
restrict the visual range
of what's available--

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.650
make you feel confinement.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:08.545
Why does he do that?

00:53:08.545 --> 00:53:11.440
One possible-- and I might
leave this for your section

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.160
but think about why he does it.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.270
One effect is surely to
make you even more aware

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.460
of how expansive the
outside is because you

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.250
are in the outside
for a lot of the time.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.330
By confining your
vision in this way,

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:25.680
it's a reminder of how
much bigness is out there.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.240
But there are other
reasons, as well,

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.440
for why the perspective
would be restricted

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.270
to these aperture shots.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.570
In any case, there are seven
of them through the film,

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.970
and they mark the
progress of the film.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:39.890
The reason that the film
is so hard to follow

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:43.730
is, in part, that the
timeframe is weird.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.950
And I'll come to
that in a second.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:47.600
There is one turning
point in the film

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.933
that I want to mention to you
that you should watch for.

00:53:49.933 --> 00:53:52.400
It's a moral turning point or
a psychologically important

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.760
turning point because it's
a moment in the film where

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.520
the sympathy of the
viewer is shifted--

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.560
is radically transformed.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.090
It occurs about midway
through the film

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:06.620
where the John Wayne character
and his sidekick, Martin

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:13.400
Pawley, come riding down
a-- not quite a mountain

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.814
but a promontory
through heavy snow.

00:54:16.814 --> 00:54:18.980
The weather in the film is
interesting and powerful.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.240
That's one of the ways
you can feel time passing.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.030
Their winters and summers go by.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:25.230
You can feel the
seasons passing.

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:27.209
But you're not clear
how much time goes by.

00:54:27.209 --> 00:54:29.000
By the end of the film,
you know many years

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.374
has gone by-- at
least 10 years--

00:54:30.374 --> 00:54:34.170
because the young girl who was
stolen away in the beginning

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:37.790
is a young woman at the end
of the film-- the adult played

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:47.100
by the actress Natalie Wood--
a very successful and important

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.645
actress of the '50s and '60s.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.470
So she's a grown
woman by the end,

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.300
so we know that a significant
amount of time has gone by.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.730
But it isn't clear
as the story's

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.390
going on exactly how
much time has gone by,

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:04.830
and that ambiguity's important.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.290
The turning point occurs as
they're coming down this hill.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:10.654
The horses are almost up
to their shoulders in snow.

00:55:10.654 --> 00:55:12.820
And they come riding down
this hill into a village--

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.150
an Indian village-- a
Native American village.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.570
And it's a Native
American village

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.180
that's in smoking ruins.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.030
It has been decimated
by American cavalry.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.570
And they go into
one of the teepees,

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:25.270
and they find--
dead in the teepee--

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:28.630
a Native American woman--
a squaw named Look

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:29.830
who had been following them.

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.260
And we've gotten to know her.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.650
And the Martin
Pawley character--

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:36.670
the secondary character--
the sidekick--

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:38.280
says to the John
Wayne character,

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.780
why did they have to kill Look?

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.330
She didn't do anything.

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:44.570
And it's a moment in which the
butchery of the white soldiers

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:48.130
is dramatized in which your
sympathy turns entirely

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:51.410
away from the official
American government

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:53.560
account of the West
towards something else.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.580
And in the very next scene,
something amazing happens.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.580
It's easy to miss because
it happens so quickly,

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.570
but it's very important,
morally, to the film.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.700
We have a scene in which we
see three Indian chieftains

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:08.880
standing in-- they're captives--
standing in blankets looking on

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.970
as another group of Native
Americans-- Indians--

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:15.330
are being, essentially,
herded into a compound--

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.430
into a hospital-type building.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:21.550
And they're being herded as
if they're cattle, or sheep,

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.310
or not fully human.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:26.820
And you can see--
there's no dialogue,

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:32.440
but you can see the
sadness and the unhappiness

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.362
and the regret in the eyes
of these sturdy chiefs

00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:37.320
as they look upon that.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.160
And what happens
in that moment is

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.940
that the film's
perspective has become

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.610
that of the Native Americans.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.390
And the audience's perspective
has become that as well.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:49.154
And so the effect
of these moments

00:56:49.154 --> 00:56:51.570
coupled with many other things
in the film-- some of which

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:52.986
I've mentioned,
some of which I've

00:56:52.986 --> 00:56:58.180
not-- about the ambiguity of the
John Wayne character's nature,

00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.300
come together here.

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.840
And this is a moment
in which something

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.020
of the complexity
of the Western story

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.650
is being acknowledged
by the text.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:10.550
No longer are we getting a
kind of simple celebration

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:12.090
of these Western values.

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.840
Something much more
ambiguous and morally complex

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.910
is happening here.

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.210
A critique of those
values is being

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:21.597
embedded in this
apparently classic Western.

00:57:21.597 --> 00:57:23.930
And it's one of the reasons
it's such a remarkable film.

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:24.730
I'll conclude now.

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:26.460
I apologize for running over.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:30.240
The title itself clarifies some
of the ambiguity of the movie.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.450
What are they searching for?

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:35.050
I said before that the timeframe
of the film is confusing,

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.190
and it's not just that.

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:39.690
Even the setting of the film--
the Monument Valley setting--

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:41.930
comes to seem almost
like a lunar landscape

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.300
before we're finished
with the film.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.200
There's a sense that the
quest goes on forever--

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.860
that they begin to lose a
sense of why they're doing it.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.774
After all, so much
time has gone by.

00:57:51.774 --> 00:57:53.940
She's lived with the Native
Americans all this time.

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.880
What's the point of the
rescue even-- we might think.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.940
The fact that the quest has
gone on for such a long time,

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.700
but it becomes more
and more unclear

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.240
why the search is going on--
what the purpose of the search

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:09.740
is.

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.200
There's a kind of
ambiguity in it

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:18.370
that is deeply disturbing
and deeply troubling.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:24.480
And, of course, the sense we
have at the end of the film

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.860
that the search-- it is
concluded, but almost

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.490
until the very
end we're not sure

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:34.230
whether the John Wayne character
is going to save or murder

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.740
the object of his quest.

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.030
And there's also the sense
that even after he's done,

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.780
what has been gained?

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.180
So there's a deep ambiguity
at the end of the movie

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.970
as there is a deep ambiguity
surrounding the alleged heroism

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:50.510
of the John Wayne character.

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:53.410
So one of the reasons I
emphasize these ambiguities

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.740
and complexities is as a
way of stressing the fact

00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.560
that even before we get
to the era of what I'll

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.690
call the anti-Western or
the dissenting Western,

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:05.780
the classic Western itself has
reached a level of complexity

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:07.780
and maturity,
embodied especially

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.990
in this film and others
that we might cite

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:13.030
from the 1960s, in which a
kind of self-consciousness

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:16.980
about the assumptions that
lie behind and animate

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:20.460
this central American form have
already come to the surface

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:23.750
and are being confronted
by our best directors

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:26.010
in our best films.

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:27.560
Goodnight.

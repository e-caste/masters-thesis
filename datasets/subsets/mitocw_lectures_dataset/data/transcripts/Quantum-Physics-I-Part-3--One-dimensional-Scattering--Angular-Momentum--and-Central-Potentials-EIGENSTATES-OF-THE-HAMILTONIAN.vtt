00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
PROFESSOR: I want to just
elucidate a little more what

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.750
are the eigenstates here.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.490
So with angular momentum,
we measure L squared

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.650
and we measure Lz.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.700
So with spin, we'll measure
spin squared and Sz.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.470
And Sz is interesting.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.570
It would be spin or angular
momentum in the z direction.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.490
So let's look at
that, Sz, this is

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.430
the operator, the measurable.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.310
It's this time nothing
else than a simple matrix.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.500
It's not the momentum operator.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.370
It's not angular momentum
operator with derivative.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.410
It's an angular
momentum operator,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.280
but it seems to have
come out of thin air.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.200
But it hasn't.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.870
So here it is.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.360
Oh, and it's diagonal already.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.070
So the eigenstates
are easily found.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.165
I have one state--

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:12.430
I don't know how I
want to call it--

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.460
I'll call it 1, 0.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.010
It's one state.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.200
And that's an eigenstate of it.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.640
We'll call it, for
simplicity, up.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.530
We'll see why.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:44.340
Sz, acting on up, is equal to
h bar over 2, 1, 0; 0, minus 1

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.530
acting on 1, 0.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.760
That's h bar over 2.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.240
And the matrix is at 1, 0.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.790
So it is an eigenstate
because it's h bar over 2 up.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.450
The 1, 0 state again.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.670
So this thing, we call it up,
because it has up component

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.220
of the z angular momentum.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.480
So it's a spin up state.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.530
What is the spin down state?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.830
It Would be 0, 1.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.120
It's a spin down.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.390
And Sz on the spin
down, it's also

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.250
an eigenstate, this time with
minus h bar over 2, spin down.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.140
And we call it spin 1/2
because of this 1/2.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.850
And you'd say, no, you
just put that constant

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.480
because you want it there.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.870
Not true, if I would have
put a different constant here

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.070
in defining this, I would
not have gotten this

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.820
without any constant, that it's
how angular momentum works.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.066
So if I use two-by-two matrices,
I'm forced to get spin 1/2.

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.700
You cannot get anything else.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.650
The 1/2 of the spin
is already there.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.390
The component of angular
momentum is h bar over 2.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.540
If you have a photon,
it has spin 1.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.580
The components of angular
momentum is plus h or minus h,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.010
if you have the two
circularly polarized waves.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.170
So this is actually interesting.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.570
But it begs for another
question because we

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.550
have a good intuition.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.070
And this is spin up
along the z direction

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.960
because it has a Sz component,
eigenvalue h over 2.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.850
So the last question
I want to ask

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:11.590
is, how do I get a spin state
to point in the x direction

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.330
or in the y direction.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.240
You see, the interpretation
of this spin state

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:28.190
is that it's a spin state
that has the spin up

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.380
in the z direction,
because that's

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.950
what you can
measure, or spin down

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.350
in the down direction of Sz.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.400
Can I get spin states that
point along the x direction or y

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.210
direction?

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.790
And here's where the problem
seems to hit you and you say,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.810
I'm in trouble.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.180
I have this state spin
up and spin down along z.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.490
And it's a two-dimensional
vector space,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.200
because two-by-two matrices, and
Sx, Sy, Sz is three dimensions.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.190
How am I going to get
three dimensions out

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.470
of two dimensions?

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.670
You just have spin states
along z, up and down.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.220
Now the spin up and
spin dow, moreover,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.480
are orthogonal states.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480
These two are orthogonal states.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.780
You see, you do the inner
product, transpose this,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.790
you get this, and times that.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.950
So they are
orthogonal, unless you

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.890
imagine this vector
plus this vector

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.300
is a full basis for
the vector space,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.750
because the vector
space is a, b.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.570
And now you see that this is
a times up plus b times down.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.830
So anything is a
superposition of up and down.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.870
So how do I ever
get something that

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.540
points along x, or something
that points along y?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.450
Well, let's try to see that.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:24.020
Well, consider Sx, you
have an Sx operator, which

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.450
is h bar over 2, 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.130
And then you can
try to analyze this,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.520
but it's more entertaining to
imagine other things, to say,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.210
look, if I've gotten this
vector 1, 0, which is up,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.410
and 0, 1, which is down,
I can try maybe a vector

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.380
that has the up and the down.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.880
Maybe the up and the down is
a vector that points nowhere.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.610
Who knows, whatever.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.220
If I want to normalize
it, I have to put a 1

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.770
over square root of 2.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.310
And now I know, it's 1
over square root of 2,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.510
up, plus down.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.380
That's what this vector is.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.410
But let's see what
Sx does on it.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:32.450
Sx on 1 over square root
of 2, 1, 1 is h bar over 2,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:39.680
1 over square root of
2, 0, 1, 1, 0, on 1, 1.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.390
So h bar over 2, 1
over square root of 2.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.180
And let's see, that gives
1, that gives me another 1.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.670
Oops, I got the same
vector I started with.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.490
It an eigenstate.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:00.771
So this thing, this plus
and down, superimposed,

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:04.570
is an eigenstate of Sx.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:10.120
So this is actually a
spin that points up,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.890
but in the x direction.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.830
Whenever we don't put anything,
we're talking about z.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.780
But this is the spin
up in the x direction.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.060
And these appeared
as the sum of a spin

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.000
up and spin down
in the z direction.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.640
It may not be too
surprising for you

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.260
to imagine that if you put
1 over square root of 2,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.919
1 minus 1, that vector is
orthogonal to this one.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.050
Yes, you do the transpose.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.310
And this one is orthogonal.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:56.750
So this is 1 over square
root of 2, up, minus, down.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.520
That is the down spin along x.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:11.870
So the up and down spins
along x come out like that.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.956
We form the linear combinations.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:31.830
So finally, you would say,
well, I'm going to push my luck

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.580
and try to get spins
along the y direction.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.030
But I now form those
linear combinations.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.395
What else could I do?

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.860
These linear
combinations are there.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:55.010
And I've got already two things.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.700
And you say, well, that's fair,
you're a two-dimensional vector

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.555
space, so you're getting two
things, spin states along x

00:10:03.555 --> 00:10:06.710
and spin states along z.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.790
But actually, we didn't
run out of things to try.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.680
We could try a state of the
form 1 over square root of 2,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.630
something like this.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.600
We could try the state up.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.020
And then, we've put
a plus, but now we

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.145
could put a plus i, state down.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:38.540
So this would be a
state of the form 1, i.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.190
And what does it do?

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.150
Well, let's see what
it does with Sy.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.730
1, i.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:59.450
And the Sy matrix is h bar
over 2 minus i, i, 0, 0, 1, i.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.190
And there's 1 over
square root of 2.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.660
So it's 1 over square root
of 2, or h bar over 2,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.040
1 over square root of 2.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.220
And let's see what we get.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:20.500
Minus i times i is one 1.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.340
And the second one is i.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.860
We get the same state.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.950
Yes, it is an eigenstate.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:35.460
So with a plus i here,
this is this spin up

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.560
along the y direction.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:47.230
And the spin down
along the y direction

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:54.560
would be up, minus i, down.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.670
This is orthogonal
to that vector.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.000
It's 1 minus i.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.270
And it's the spin down
in the y direction.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.090
You can calculate
the eigenvalue,

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:14.055
it's minus h bar over 2,
and it's pointing down.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:22.310
So your complex numbers
play the crucial role.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.020
If you didn't have
complex numbers,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.610
there was no way you could ever
get a state that this pointing

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.200
in all possible directions.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.510
And you also see,
finally, that this thing

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.190
has nothing to do with your
usual wave functions, functions

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.620
of x, theta, phi.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.060
No, spin is an additional
world with two degrees

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.480
of freedom, an extra thing.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.640
It doesn't have a
simple wave function.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.590
The spin wave functions are
these two column vectors.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.330
But there is angular momentum in
there, as you discovered here.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.790
There is a commutation
relations of angular momentum,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.760
the units of angular
momentum, the eigenvalues

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.610
of angular momentum.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:16.365
And this great thing is
such a nice simple piece

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:16.990
of mathematics.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.410
It has an enormous utility.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.410
It describes the
spins of particles.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.360
So it's an introduction,
in some sense,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.900
to what 805 is all about.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.230
Spin systems are
extremely important,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.690
practical applications.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.570
These things, because they
have basically two states,

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:46.780
are essentially qubits
for a quantum computer.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.420
Within these systems,
we understand,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.330
in the simplest
way, entanglement,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.780
Bell inequalities,
superposition,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.840

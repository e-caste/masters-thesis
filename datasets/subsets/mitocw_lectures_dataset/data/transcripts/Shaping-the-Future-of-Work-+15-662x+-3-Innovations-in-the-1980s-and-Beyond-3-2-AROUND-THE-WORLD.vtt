00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.800
In the previous
video, we focused

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.020
on how the corporation is
changing in the United States.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.760
But what about corporations
around the world?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.630
Turns out there's quite
a bit of variation

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.840
both across countries
and over time.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.100
So let's take a
brief tour of what's

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.360
happening in other places.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.460
Corporations in the United
Kingdom, Canada, Australia

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.220
tend to follow the US model of
putting shareholder value very

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.590
high in their priorities.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.270
But they haven't
gone quite as far.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.110
For example, CEOs aren't paid
as much in those countries

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.240
as in the United States.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.800
So the gap between CEO
pay and average worker pay

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.470
isn't nearly as much as we
have in the United States.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.130
But some other countries, like
Germany and Norway and Sweden,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.020
have tended to take much more
of a multiple stakeholder

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.970
view of the firm and
its responsibilities.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.180
We can best see this
as the way companies

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.550
are organized in Germany.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.129
So let's take a look at Germany.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.160
In Germany, the
board of supervisors,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.240
equivalent to boards of
directors in the United States,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.330
is made up of large
representatives

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.740
of large financial institutions
and representatives

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.080
of employees, sometimes equal
numbers and sometimes different

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.940
percentages.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.520
But employees play a role
in corporate governance

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.260
directly in Germany.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.220
At the workplace level, there
are consultative bodies called

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.180
works councils, elected bodies
elected by blue collar workers,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.480
production workers, white
collar workers, managers,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.150
and supervisors, all
there to provide advice

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.380
to the company on its human
resource and employment

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.980
practices.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.690
And in fact, the company has
to listen to the works council

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.920
when it makes changes
in employment policies.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.840
Then corporations are also
very active in training,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.810
working together at the original
level with vocational schools

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.130
and with labor to build
apprenticeship programs so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.750
that they have an
adequate supply of workers

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.199
for today's economy and
for tomorrow's technology

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.050
and economy.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.600
So in Germany and in
European countries,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.890
you tend to see much more
of the corporation taking

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.130
a responsible role for
these kinds of activities.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.650
Let's look at another
example, Japan.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.690
Japan has corporate boards that
have basically three groups.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.920
First, they have the
investors, the banks.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.210
Secondly, they have suppliers
and the network of suppliers

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.760
that firms have long
term relationships with.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.840
And third, they have internal
corporate executives.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.110
And in fact, often the
most influential executive

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.800
in Japanese corporations
sitting on these boards

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.060
is the human resource executive.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.810
we see longer term
employment security

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.720
part of the Japanese tradition.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.090
We see much more investment
in training and development

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.100
of employees from within.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.840
Now these practices
are changing.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.930
Japan's economy
has been struggling

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.120
to adapt to a more
innovative, flexible economy.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.680
And so some corporations open
to international competition

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.030
have moved more toward the
American model in recent years.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.030
So nothing is cut in stone.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.960
Changes happen from time to
time as the economy changes.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.760
Here's another example, Korea,
also in the throes of change.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.540
Korea also has a long history
of very large corporations, very

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.740
paternalistic, long term
employment security.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.360
But as Korea has made
a very strong effort

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.760
to become more flexible,
more innovative,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.730
some of these
traditions are changing.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.840
And that's led to
lots of conflict

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.860
over the appropriate role
of the corporation in Korea.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.170
So there is a country that
is in the throes of change.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.130
We'll have to wait and
see how it plays out.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.240
Some companies in
various countries

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.410
have charted their own
course, independent of what

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.580
the government is doing.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.730
For example in Brazil,
there's a very famous company

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.550
called Semco that in the
1980s, a new CEO took over

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.140
by the name of Richard Semler.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.150
And he helped grow that
company from about $2 million

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.899
in revenue to over $200
million in about a decade.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.140
And what did he do?

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.580
He said let's democratize
the organization.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.060
Let's let workers
shape their own jobs.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.090
Let's let workers
help us to figure out

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.400
how we can expand
into new industries

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.650
and diversify this
company and become

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.400
part of the world economy.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.150
And in fact he's been
recognized for his leadership

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.230
and his vision by the
World Economic Forum, which

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.800
described him and gave
him an award as one

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.700
of the global
leaders of tomorrow.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.150
Likewise in Finland, a
company by the name of Nokia,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.040
known well in the
telecommunications industry

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.230
and in the phone business, had
a very difficult time adjusting

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.440
to changes in its markets.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.810
And so it's had to restructure
and lay off a lot of workers.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.990
But as it did so,
it decided that it

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.110
would allow workers to take
some of the product development

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.060
ideas that they had been working
on and some of their own ideas

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.810
for new directions
for the company

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.480
and start their own companies.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.080
And they would support
these employees

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.230
during this transition period.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.710
So you can see
that companies can

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.770
shape their own corporate
governance arrangements, even

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.450
within a national government.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.570
Well, what can we learn
from this very quick survey

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.460
around the world
of how corporations

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.660
structure themselves?

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.540
I think there are two lessons.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.640
First, there's no one best way.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.780
The American mantra of
profits over everything else

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.690
isn't necessarily
copied around the world.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.430
There are different approaches.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.610
And the second
thing to recognize

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.910
is that these all have to
adapt over time to changes

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.830
in the economy, to changes
in the workplace issues

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.900
that we are facing.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.590
And so we can change our
corporate governance policies,

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.520
even within a country,
when necessary.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.130
And so I think
this is good news.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.310
It means there is
no one best model.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.760
It means that we
can adapt over time.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.810
And it means that we have some
choice over how we structure

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.470
the role of the corporation in
response to its shareholders

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.590
and other stakeholders
in society.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.360
So let's get on with
thinking about what

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.470
role do we want the
corporation in our society

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.240
to play today and tomorrow.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, we have another kind of very
interesting piece of the course

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
right now.  We're going to continue
to talk about genetics,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
except now we're going to talk about
the genetics of diploid organisms,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which apart from bacteria, most of
the organisms including us are

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
diploid.  They have more than one
copy of each chromosome,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and so we'll go through a segment on
this, and also talk about mitosis

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and meiosis, the central processes
of cell division and the segregation

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
of genetic material that underlie
life as we know it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And then, were going to charge into
a session of recombinant DNA,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and some of these technologies,
PCR and various things that you see

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in the newspapers all the time.
And then, I'll finish up with the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
session on the immune system,
which a few of you thought was

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
surprising that bacteria recombines.
I'll tell you in that system it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
will feel like science fiction
relative to what I've told

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you up to now.
It's an absolutely amazing system.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, we are going to start today
with genetics of diploid organisms.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So I'm going to go back to how this
was first understood.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And most of you have probably heard
of Gregor Mendel,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
who discovered this,
and surely some fraction of you have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
run into an exposure to this topic
before.  But in keeping with what

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm trying to do in this course,
could you guys watch out there?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I think I'm just going to unplug,
yeah, it's OK.  I think I'm just

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
going to unplug it for just a minute
here.  You've probably heard of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Mendel.  Some of you have seen these
different squares.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You might have memorized it from a
textbook or something like that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm going to try and see if we can
go through this material up another

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
level of sophistication because,
again, and I'm saying, science

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
didn't just come down from on high
and end up with facts

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in a textbook.
What's in a textbook is somebody's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
effort to take a current state of
understanding which is based on

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
experimentation and come up with
models.  And what you're seeing in

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the textbooks are the models such as
they were as of the time the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
textbook was submitted for
publication.  Sometimes they change

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
even before the textbooks get out.
But anyway, it's a process.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Mendel was one of the starting
people who started this process,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
really a key figure, and a guy with
an amazing intellect.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But before we start in,
I just want to show you a couple of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
pictures because these kind of
knocked me over when I saw them.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I don't know what kind of image you
have of Mendel.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You probably know he was a monk,
and he did something with peas, and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
he figured out this stuff about
genetics.  And most people probably

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
carry around an image probably
somewhat like this sort of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
romanticized drawing.
He was a monk all right,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but it was at an Augustine monastery
in Bruno in Austria that was a very

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
major intellectual center.
They even published a scientific

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
journal.  They sent Mendel off to
Vienna to go to university.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
While he was there, he studied
physics, math,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
as well as botany.
So he had, in many ways,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
a background that is very similar to
you guys, very heavy on the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
quantitative physical science,
mathematical sort of background.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And then he went on to do some
experiments in biology.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And I think you maybe can get a
sense of this.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You can see a picture of what
Mendel actually looked like.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Here's one picture of him.  But the
one that really blew me away,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I have a picture of the monks.
Just think of what ever image you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
had of the monks that
Mendel was at.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well there's a picture of them.
To me, they look nothing so much

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
like a group of university
presidents or something sitting

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
around for a portrait.
And he traveled very widely.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Here he was on his way to London
here.  Here is a picture of him with

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
a group of people on his way to,
I think he was in Paris on his way

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to London.  So this wasn't a little
isolated monk in a garden who

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
stumbled across stuff.
He was a rather sophisticated guy

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
going after some interesting
problems.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And this was the garden in which he
did his experiments.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Here's a picture of it.
So this was a straightforward

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
experimental setup for these really
amazing things he did.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So, with that kind of background,
Mendel was interested in a problem

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of inheritance.
And people have been aware that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
traits were inherited.
That was the whole principle of

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
domesticating animals and
domesticating crops,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that if you took parents with
certain characteristics and crossed

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
them together,
the offspring then had the traits

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that were associated with the
parents.  And so people have able to

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
get better domesticated animals or
better domesticated crops.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But up until then, this mixing was
thought of sort of like blending

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
liquids, stir together some green
and red, and a little

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
this and that.
And it all stirred together.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And as you'll see, what one of
Mendel's great insights was,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
was that it wasn't like mixing
liquids.  And to study this problem,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
then, he picked a system.  It wasn't
that he was just fiddling around

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
with peas.  He was a pretty
sophisticated guy,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and he picked peas as an
experimental organisms

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
for three reasons.
And so, why peas?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Well one, they were easy to grow,
and that's still a major

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
consideration of any model system
that you want to use and science

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
today.  It's really tricky to grow,
it's very hard to work with.  It was

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
easy to pollinate in
a controlled way.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Just the structure of the pea flower
makes it very easy to make sure to

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
either put the pollen right on the
pistol of that same flower,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
which is a kind of self
fertilization,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
or to make sure that the pollen goes
from one flower to another,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
which is basically cross-pollination.
And the third thing,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and this was a really important
thing, was the system had worked on

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
before.  And there were a number of
what were called pure

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
breeding lines.
If he had just grabbed peas out of

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the wild it would be sort of like me
starting to do genetics by crossing

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
a couple of you guys.
We'd get offspring, all right,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and we'd cross those offspring, we'd
keep getting things,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
people that look different and
different, maybe something like the

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
parents, but what had happened with
peas is people had taken a pea,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and then they continually inbred it
until it finally sort of settled

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
down.  It always had
white flowers.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It always had wrinkled seeds.
It always had whatever the

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
particular trait was.
And so, I think I showed you the

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
slide earlier.
This shows two things.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You can see there are smooth seeds
and then wrinkled seeds.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And it may be a little hard to tell
in this light,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but there is sort of two colors here.
One's kind of greenish and one's

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
sort of yellowish.
So there, you see two of the traits

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
right there.  There were also flower
colors, and height,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and other things that had the
characteristic.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They were pure breeding.
Every time you took that line and

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
if you self crossed it and put out
its progeny, you'd see the same

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
characteristic each time.
So, this was the system that Mendel

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
started to study this problem of
inheritance.  And how does blending

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
come together when two organisms
brought pollen?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Or, if it was other animals like us,
it would be sperm and egg.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But somehow, you did something that
ended up giving you an egg that got

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
fertilized.  And out of that came
the progeny.  So,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
what Mendel did, the term that's
used, they say he carried out a

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
cross.  This is genetic-speak here
now.  So he took pollen

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:09.000
from one plant.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And used it to fertilize another
plant, collected the seeds that came

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
out of this, and he examined the
progeny.  And I think an interesting

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
way of thinking about this
is a UROP project.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You'd come into Mendel's lab and
wanted to do a UROP project,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
it was pretty easy.  I could
probably show you all the techniques

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
you needed to know,
and this is it.  You'd show how you

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
pollinate, collect seeds,
and then we'd look at the

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
characteristics.
So, it's just some fairly simple

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
manipulations and some observational
stuff.  So, let's suppose you're

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
doing Mendel's thing as a UROP
project, and let's just see where

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that will take us.
So, what Mendel did to begin with,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
he took one of these pure breeding
lines that was smooth or all

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
abbreviated as a capital S.
And he pollinated it with something

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that was wrinkled.
I'll do that as little S.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And then he collected the seeds
from what's known as the first

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
generation, starting with
something like this.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And geneticists use the term F1 for
this first generation in a cross

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000
like this, and what he found was
everything, all the seeds,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:03.000
were smooth.  So, the wrinkled trait
had, if you will, disappeared.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:19.000
That's your first UROP experiment.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
[Time doesn't?] submit to nature,
or science, or something,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and read a little paper like Watson
and Craig that turns the world on

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
its end.  What would you do next?
No gels, no Whitehead Sequencing

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Facility.  Anybody got any ideas?
I've showed you all the techniques

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that he knew about.
Pardon?  Cross it again?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What's your thinking?  Do you think
the traits disappear,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
or do you think it's hiding?
It might be hiding, right?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I don't know what he thought,
but I think that's a reasonable to

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
think about it is he's probably
trying to figure out,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
did this wrinkled trait just
disappear from the face of the Earth,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
or is it hiding in those
first-generation seeds?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So, let's put that up here.
So, that's exactly what he did.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So, he took these seeds, now, that
were the smooth F1.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
These are not the same smooth as
the parental up here.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Just to make clear, you guys
understand these are pure breeding.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
These are the ones that people have
been breeding for a long time,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
this one and this one.
In this case, even though I'm trying

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it in circles,
this is a smooth F1,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
smooth F1.  And, this time when he
did the experiment he looked at the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
second generation,
or the F2 generation as a geneticist

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000
would call it.
What he found,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
he got some smooth and he got some
wrinkled.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, the wrinkled trait reemerged in
the F2.  So it wasn't really gone.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It was hiding.
OK, time to submit to nature's

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
science cell.  Got it?
He didn't try and publish it at

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that point.  He did something else.
He had the same kind of background

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
you guys have.
Can he think what he might've done?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
He could cross again.  There's
something else he did with this

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
experiment, though.
Well, you're thinking of new

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
experiments.
He's got a little data processing he

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
can do here.  What did you say?
I'm not able to hear, sorry.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Statistics, OK.
I'll simplify it even slightly

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
before that.  I've got some of each.
Count them, right, exactly.  So

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that's what he did,
and I think the numbers were,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
if I remember, five, four, seven,
four in 1850.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So, what should I do now?
Ratio: absolutely.  We could count

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
another million of them,
but that probably would not be

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
terribly productive.
And what he found out is that when

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
he did that, he found that he got a
ratio that was pretty

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
close to 3:1.
And, so that was sort of what he

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:46.000
found out from this by doing this
sort of thing over again was a

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:58.000
pattern.  A trait disappeared in the
F1.  The trait reemerged in the F2,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and the two traits had this.
The ratio of the two traits would be

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
about 3:1.  If you don't think this
is sort of like a UROP project or

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
something, that's a page out of some
of Mendel's actual notes while he

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
was doing his crosses.
And what he did next, then,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
was to take some other traits.
Yeah?  Sorry?  Excuse me?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Reemerged in F2.  So, he took some
other traits, white and purple

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
flowers, tall,
short, I found that there were at

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
least certain other traits.
It didn't work for everything he

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
studied, but some of them he could
see the same pattern.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
One of the traits disappeared.
It reemerged in the F2, and when he

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
counted them, he'd find that the
trait that reemerged was at one,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and the other one there were three
times as many.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So, he'd seen a pattern.
And all he's done at this point is

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
to cross flowers and count the
progeny.  So, at that point Mendel

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
tried to explain his data.
So, he had to, now, take the next

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
part of the scientific process.
And what's kind of nice about

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
thinking about Mendel,
in this sense, is we are not

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
overwhelmed by complicated
techniques.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You can see, I think,
the scientific process.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And it's a very bare bones thing
marching along.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So now he's got some data.
He's quantitated his stuff.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
He's founded reproducible.  It's
not only for seeds.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
It seems to be some general feature.
And the thing about this,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I guess, I don't know what he
thought but it seems to be likely

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
that he could see that this didn't
fit very well with the blending idea.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Like, you'd pour together two
liquids, and you'd

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
stir them all up.
Instead, he really made this

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
monumental leap in thinking that
genetic information must come in

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
some sort of particular form,
come in particles, or units, or

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
quanta if you want to think about if
it if you're a physicist.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
We know those units as genes right
now.  We grow up with it right now,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
but to go from the idea that genetic
information was kind of like two

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
liquids blending to the idea it was
a little particle,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
so it was just about the same kind
of leap as thinking that energy

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
comes in particles instead of a
continuous sort of thing.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:48.000
So, that was the kind of insight
that Mendel had.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And so genetic info comes in
particles, units.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I was going to say,
we now call these genes,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and if that was what it was then he
started to think about these traits

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
as particles that had a different
character associated with each of

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
them.  That would mean there would
be one particle that was a big S,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and that was smooth.  There was some
other particle that was specified.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
The wrinkled character, that would
be called a small s.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So, what was happening in these
crosses, then,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
he was now mixing particles instead
of liquids.  Again,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I don't know how he got to,
how many particles there had to be

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
of each per organism.
It could have been anywhere from

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
two upwards.  He had to have two in
order to explain the sort of stuff

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
he was working with.
There's no reason he couldn't have

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
thought of 12 or something.
But I assume you start with the very

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
simplest thing,
number that you can think of,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and see if you can make this work.
So, what he hypothesized, then, was

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000
that each organism had two copies of
each of these particles.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000
So, two copies of each particle,
so this would mean that there were

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000
two types of particles.
So, there would be the S and the

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
smooth.  So, he can get three types
of things.  He could get one that

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
was both big S or smooth.
Or you could have the ones that

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000
were the two little S's.
And these would be wrinkled.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Or, if you had the other combination,
what he figured out,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
what fit with this model is these
would have to be smooth.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
That would have to mean that one of
them is dominant over the other when

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
you put them in combination.
So, in this thing, the big S would

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
be said to be dominant.
And the little s Would be said to be

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
recessive.  There's another little
term here that I'm going to

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
introduce because it'll help us talk
about this stuff over the next few

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
days, terms geneticists use all the
time.  Because these both have two

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
of the same, they're said to be
homozygous, do the same.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And this one, with one of each,
is said to be heterozygous.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
OK, so there is,
I think, sort of the setup for

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Mendel's model.
He had to contend with one other

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
issue, though,
and that was if every organism has

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
two, and two parents get together
and each donate something,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
unless you did something, the
offspring would have four.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
When those offspring got together,
the next one would have twice as

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
many, and so on.
So, from probably,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I don't know whether it was just
from first principle,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
but I would imagine he figured out
that if organisms had sex with

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
pollen and whatever,
or egg and sperm, that something had

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
to be done to get around this
problem of an ever increasing number

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
of particles.  So,
he envisioned that when there were

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
specialized cells for sex,
and that they have the number so

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
that the sex cells would have half
the number of particles so that when

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
each parent donated one, you'd
be back up to two.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
It's pretty simple,
straightforward thinking once you've

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
gotten the idea that these things
are coming in a particular form.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
So, with this, could he now explain
his results?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Let's do it over here.
So, what happened in the first

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000
cross?  He had a smooth,
pure breeding line crossed with,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
so the sex cells from this, each one
would have been a big S,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
and the sex cells from each one of
this would have been a little s.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And as you recall, what he got was
all smooth, right?  Remember?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
So, if we try and figure out what's
happening here,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
a way of representing this would be
to think what happens if all of the

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
combinations that you could get,
so if we paired them in all possible

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
ways, then every combination would
be identical from that first cross,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
one from one parent, one from the
other.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And, if one was dominant over the
other, it's going to look like this.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
This is really the word I
introduced you to.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
That's the genotype.
That's what's going on down at the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
genetic level.
What you're seeing up here is the

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
observable characteristics
of the organism.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
That would be the phenotype.
So, then what would happen then

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000
with this if he crossed the F1's?
Well, as you recall, they were

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
smooth, but he was now seeing them
as being like this.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
So that means that the sex cells
that are generated from this,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
each one will generate one big S,
and one little s.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And then, if you put them together
to see how this would work out,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:51.000
well, this one's two big S's.  This
is a big S and a little s,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:00.000
a big S and a little s, and two
little s's.  So,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:09.000
what he's got over here is SS,
SS, and a ratio of 1:2:1.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
But when you look at the phenotype,
what would we expect?  Well, this

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
would be smooth,
big S and little s.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
That's smooth.  Big S,
little s, smooth again, and two

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
little s's, that's wrinkled.
There's his ratio of 3:1.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Has he proved anything?  It works.
Beautiful.  The model must be right?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:50.000
What do you think?
Are you ready to publish?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Why is that?  Why did the model
work?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Has the model predicted anything yet?
No, it works because it describes

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
the data.  To some extent,
it's kind of like hitting a curve.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
You said it, but you don't really
know yet.  Of course it's going to

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
work, because if you got different
data it would've had a different

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
model.  So, you're putting your
finger on a really important point,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
and that is that you can do an
experiment.  You can get data.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
It doesn't have to involve DNA
sequencing or fancy technique.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
You're getting data out of a
biological system.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
You've come up with a hypothesis
that explains it.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
But of course it's going to explain
it because you wouldn't publish a

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
model that didn't explain your own
data.  But what he hasn't done is

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
tested it.  Will his model predict
the outcome of something that he

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
hasn't already done?
So, the suggestion was that he

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
should carry out another cross.
And that's what Mendel then did

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
again.
This is what he had to work with.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
He could cross, and he could count,
and he could do some calculating and

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000
some thinking.
But, those were the techniques.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I really like thinking about this,
because you can sort of put yourself

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000
in his shoes.  So,
what would you guys like to cross?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
We haven't got much, right?  One,
he did.  One cross he did,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
the F1 with the homozygous dominant
parent, the pure breeding lines.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
So, he's got this smooth,
that's a big S and a little s,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
and he's crossing it with something,
two big S's.  So, the sex cells that

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.000
you'll get out of this,
so if you set this one up and see

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
what happens, there's the two.
You will get to big S's,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
big S, little S, the big S,
little S.  This is sort of

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
uninformative.
If you want to look at your notes

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
afterwards, and have this be
consistent, let me just

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
flip this slightly.
I put the two big S's up here,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
and this is our F1 down here.  That
way I'll be following the same

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
pattern as I did before.
OK, so there we are.  In any case,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
they're all smooth, but that's not
particularly helpful.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
He's seen that result before.
It hasn't really proven out.  Given

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
the sort of unexpected result that's
predicted by his model.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
But he tried another one that's
very, very similar.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:15.000
And in this case,
he crossed the F1 with the

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:27.000
homozygous recessive parent.
This is a really important process

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
in genetics.
And the reason,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
because it's so important,
it's given a special term that's

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
called a test cross.
Let's see what happens with this

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
one, because this one's more
interesting.  So,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
we take the F1.  So,
this is the F1.  He's now crossing

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
it with this homozygous recessive,
so a parent that's got two particles

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
that are little s.
And so, will the sex cells look like

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
this, a big S little s as before,
to little S's here?  So, if we set

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
up this, as we've done,
there are the sex cells from this F1.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Here are the sex cells from the
homozygous, recessive parent.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Up here, we get a big S and a
little s for each of those.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
But here, we get two little s's.
So, if we look at the phenotype,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
if you're out on the field or out in
the garden sitting in the kitchen,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
after you brought your seeds in or
wherever he was working,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
what would you predict you'd see in
a cross like this?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
These would be both smooth,
but these would both be wrinkled.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
So, here at the genotypic level,
we've got a ratio, now, of 1:1.  And

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
here as well, there's now a ratio of
1:1.  So, there you have a result

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
that you haven't seen before.
And, if you do that cross and get

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
that result, again,
it doesn't prove your model.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Scientific proof is never a QED.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Somebody can always come up with an
experiment tomorrow that disproves

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
it.  It tends to work more.
You just keep shoveling on evidence,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
and finally someone says,
enough, enough, I believe you.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
So, this was at least a test of the
model, and the model survived this

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
task.  Now, he did one other
experiment.  Of the things that

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
we've got on our plate right now,
is there anything else we might do

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.000
you can think of?
He did another cross.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Pardon?  Two of the heterogeneous
ones, we did the F1's against each

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:24.000
other.  That's where we got the 3:1.
We've already crossed the F1's, but

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:33.000
I like your idea.  What
if we took the F2's?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
In this case, it's going to be
pretty complicated because they've

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
got this 2:1:1,
but one of the things you can do

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
with peas is you can self fertilize
them as well as cross them with

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
their neighbors because they've got
the ability to make the eggs.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
It'll become the seeds, and they
have the pollen,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
which would be equivalent to the
sperm.  So it got both.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
So, as long as there's some plants
that you can self fertilize and some

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
you can't, one of the really nice
things about peas,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
they have the property that you can
self fertilize them.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So, another kind of experiment that
Mendel did, then,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
was to self fertilize another test
of the model, self fertilize the

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
F2's.  Well, the model predicts,
if we look back over there, that

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000
what you'll have there is a mix of
things in a ratio of 1:2:1.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
So, if you were to take seeds from
that F2, and then cross them with

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
themselves, you could figure out all
the different outcomes,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
and then sum them up.  You'd have a
prediction for what this

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
model would suggest.
All right, so let me just take you

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
through the pieces.
Let's think about a quarter of them,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
according to the model,
a quarter are that.  So,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
if we self cross those, what we
should get is all wrinkled because

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
the only thing we're dealing with is
the wrinkled trait.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
So, that would be a quarter of the
F2 seeds would be expected

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000
to give that outcome.
So, three quarters of them are

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:51.000
smooth, but it's tricky because
there's two types of them in there,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:03.000
right?  So, of these, one third are
this, and two thirds have that.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
So, what would happen if we thought
about each of those individually,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
and thought about the outcome?  Well,
if we take the SS type,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
and we've self crossed them,
what we're going to get is all

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
smooth because all we've got in the
cross are the traits for the smooth

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
characteristic.
And, if we take these guys and

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
we've self-crossed them, we've
already done that.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000
We know what we will get is we will
get smooth to wrinkled in a ratio of

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000
3:1.  So, again,
you could now sit down with that and

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.000
figure out in total what you would
predict in terms of smooth and

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:09.000
wrinkled if you self crossed the F2,
and if the model is correct.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
So, that was basically [your?
first UROP project, or the end of

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
the first term,
or the first year,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
or something like that.
And he did publish those results

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
that were published in 1866,
which was the same year as those,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
about the same time as those results
that Pasteur was publishing that I

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
told you about earlier on.
So, it was a very impressive in

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
retrospect, a truly major
intellectual leap.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
But, it had almost no impact at all
on the world.  And there's a theme

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
here that it sort of tried to hit up
several times.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
And we saw it,
to some extent,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
with the early work on DNA,
that someone can get evidence for an

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
idea.  But if the scientific
community is ready to accept it,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
it can take quite awhile before that
idea becomes credible even if it's

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
correct.  The data was there.
The DNA was genetic material quite

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
a bit before the general scientists
thought it was,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
and it just seemed like it was too
simple a molecule,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
too boring a molecule to be possibly
able to encode anything.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And the same sort of thing happened
here.  It was some geneticists

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
picked up on this but not
until about 1900.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
PROFESSOR 1: --labs based
on electronic structure,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.820
and this will cover the
next two computational labs.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.860
And on Thursday,
we'll start looking

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.930
at some of the
finite temperature

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.150
ideas that are based
on the energy models

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.910
that we have seen.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.130
This, by the way, is
[? Roberto ?] [? Bajo ?]

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.610
missing a penalty shot.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.540
So a reminder of what we
have seen in the last class.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.360
We have introduced the
idea of pseudopotentials.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.180
In order to remove the cost of
carrying out calculation that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.710
include the core electrons
that are very many, especially

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
in sort of larger atoms,
and that have exceedingly

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.650
high oscillations
around the nucleus

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.030
due to the orthogonality
constraint. what we have done

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.340
is we have substituted
what would be the z over r

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.580
Coulomb potential with--

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.760
inside of the core
region of the nucleus--

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.110
a pseudopotential.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.300
That is a potential
that reproduces

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.620
the effect of the nucleus, and
of the frozen core electrons.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.890
And as you can see,
this pseudopotential

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.910
tends to be repulsive close to
the origin, basically again,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.940
reproducing this sort
of angular momentum push

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.140
outwards of the core electrons
to the valence electrons.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.110
And in order to make this
pseudopotential very accurate,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.470
there has been this idea
that has been developed

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.320
of norm conserving
pseudopotential that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.210
will act differently on
the different components

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.070
of a valence electron
wave function.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.320
So you have an
incoming electron,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.430
so you have a sort of ground
state valence wave function.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.900
You can decompose it.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.160
You can decide how much of
it is SP or the component,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.460
and you can act differently
on the different slices

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.030
of this wave function.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.940
And so with this, basically,
we can solve a new problem

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.350
in an effective external
potential in which the lowest

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.260
energy ground
state will actually

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.919
be identical in energy
to the valence eigenstate

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.730
of the original so-called all
electron on the atom with all

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.840
its electrons.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.230
And the wave function
for this pseudo-atom

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.100
will be identical to the wave
function of the real atom

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.740
outside of the core radius--
outside, in this case,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.840
three atomic units
in this slide.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.100
So this was sort of one of
the first important technical

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.560
proofs that were introduced
in the '70s and '80s

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.740
to make this calculation
really feasible.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.570
The other sort of
idea that I want

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.180
to sort of remind
you is that whenever

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.400
we deal with extended systems--

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.280
solids, liquids,
and in particular,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.650
when we have periodic
boundary condition-- that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.750
is we have our unit
cell periodically

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.770
repeated in all dimensions-- the
eigenstates of our Hamiltonian

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.360
take the form of Bloch Theorem,
and get classified according

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.280
to two quantum numbers.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.090
A discrete number-- the
bounding that's number n--

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.730
and the continuous number k.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.790
And the overall
eigenstates can be written

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.310
as a product of two functions.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.010
One is just a
plane wave that has

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.300
the periodicity of the so-called
crystal momentum K, one

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.160
of these quantum numbers.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.420
And the other is the periodic
part of this Bloch orbital

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.070
written here as u.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.210
And that this is a function
with the same periodicity

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.560
of your unit cell.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.200
So overall, the orbital itself--

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.630
the [INAUDIBLE] orbital psi
can have any periodicity,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.450
but it can always be
decomposed into a part

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.560
of a well-defined wavelength
times a periodic part.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.810
Periodic part is
going to be smooth.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.120
Again, we don't have
any more core electrons,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.020
so close to the nuclei,
it will look just

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.560
as 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.290
And that periodic
part can actually

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.910
be expanded in a
set of plane waves--

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.750
plane waves that need to
satisfy the periodic boundary

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.050
condition of our system.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.190
And so we have seen that
we can write the functions

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.230
e to the iGr, where the
G is a linear combination

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.160
of primitive reciprocal
lattice vectors with integer

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.490
coefficients, and
all those G vectors

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.990
are such that e to the iGr
has the same periodicity

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.150
of your direct lattice.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.200
And these are the coefficient
of the series expansion.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.750
And we sort of
can systematically

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.260
improve the quality of
this basic set expansion

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.500
by increasing the
number of G vectors

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.740
that we use, and we can
do that systematically

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.670
by taking G vectors with
longer and longer lengths,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.630
or as we say, with higher
and higher energy cutoff,

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.090
because higher and
higher energy [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.170
longer and longer moduli for
the G vectors corresponds

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.200
to plane waves with finer
and finer periodicity,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.630
so with finer and
finer resolution.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.560
So this is a distinct
advantage of plane waves.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.760
And in addition, this
basis sets do not

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.750
depend on atomic position.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.690
So when we calculate
forces, say,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.930
to do molecular dynamics
or a structural relaxation

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.090
calculation, we don't
need to take into account

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.670
the fact that the
basis set changes

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.790
with the position of the atoms.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.980
Plane waves are not
the only choices.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.630
There are a number
of other choices

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.010
that are very successful.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.020
In particular, a lot of
the quantum chemistry

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.110
could use a Gaussian basis sets.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.420
So atom-centered orbitals
that decay as Gaussians.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.660
This is very convenient to do
calculations like the exchange

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.130
term in Hartree-Fock.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.390
But of course, you could
have just a finite difference

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.590
representation.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.950
So you could represent
your orbitals

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.350
on a grid of points
in real space.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.950
That tends to be very efficient
to do parallel calculation,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.100
but it's very difficult
to do accurate calculation

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.780
of the second derivative.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.600
If you remember, when you expand
a function in plane waves,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.510
you have an analytic expression
for the second derivative

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.630
just because the first and
second derivative of plane

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.170
waves are just ig or minus g
squared times the plane wave

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.010
itself.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.570
And that's very important.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.630
So that's when sort of
real space representation

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.460
becomes a little bit trickier.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.945
And then there are
a number of sort

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:41.010
of more approximate
approaches based

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.730
on a number of sort of
atomic-like localized orbitals.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.360
Or there are a number of
sort of accurate approaches

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.080
that are based usually on a
combination of a basic set that

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.110
has a plane wave-like
characteristic in the regions

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.510
that are far away
from the nuclei,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.810
and then it has atomic like
characteristics in the region

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.040
inside the nuclei.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.030
And this tends to be the most
accurate, but also slightly

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.810
more expensive approaches.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.310
This concludes one of
the technical points

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.420
that you need to be careful
in a practical calculation.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.270
The other point that sort
of comes over and over

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.260
again has to do with
Brillouin Zone integration.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.257
Let me give you a first
example of a molecule.

00:07:27.257 --> 00:07:29.340
So if you are calculating
the electronic structure

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.730
of a molecule, in the
course of your calculation,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.430
you'll need to calculate
integrated quantity

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.200
like the charge density.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.420
The charge density
of a molecule is

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.500
going to be the sum of
the square moduli of all

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.550
the single particle orbitals.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.410
So if you are sort of studying
a molecule like just hydrogen 2,

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.410
well, you just take the
sum of the square moduli

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.760
of the first orbital--

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.160
you have more orbital,
more complex molecule.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.520
You need to sum over
all the orbitals up

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.840
to the [INAUDIBLE]---- the highest
occupied molecular orbital.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.120
You do a calculation
in a solid, you

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.580
have to do exactly
the same thing.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.920
That is, you need to calculate
the charge density by summing

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.730
over the occupied states.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.310
Now as I said, what
are the quantum numbers

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.060
that describe a solid
are a [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.060
and a continuous
index scale that we

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.860
call the quasi-momentum.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.150
And we usually represent,
say, the energy of the states

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.370
in a solid with a band diagram.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.860
And I've plotted here
on the left the band

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.190
diagram for silicon.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.620
In particular, what
we are looking here

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.750
is in the Brillouin
Zone of silicon

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.540
along certain high
symmetry direction.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.710
I presume these are the
high symmetry points,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.720
like gamma would be 0, 0, 0.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.530
[? Alpha ?] would
be 1/2, 1/2, 1/2.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.490
Hope this is correct.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.790
This should be x,
and it is 1, 0, 0.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:08.760
So we plot the energies of all
the occupied bands of silicon

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.960
in different directions
along the Brillouin Zone.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.570
Silicon has two
atoms per unit cell.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.150
Each atom has four
valence electrons,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:24.030
so we have eight valence
electrons per unit cell.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.450
It's a system in which there
is basically spin degeneracy.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.340
So there is really sort
of the same spatial part

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.330
for spin up and spin down.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.380
So what we usually say is
that we can accommodate

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.470
two electrons for
each space orbital,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.290
and they will just have
different spin quantum number.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.170
So with these eight
valence electrons,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.660
we end up with four valence.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.570
And sometimes, because of
symmetry, you have degeneracy,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.670
but you see that
somewhere like here

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.730
at a sort of arbitrary low
symmetry point in the Brillouin

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.140
Zone, you can clearly
see four bands.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.340
So if we want to calculate the
charge density of the system,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.840
we need to sum over all the
possible occupied states.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.320
That is, we need to sum
over all the four bands,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.520
and that's trivial.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.380
But we also need to integrate
over all the possible k

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:18.950
vectors.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.880
That is, we need to make an
integral in the Brillouin Zone.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.425
That is, we need
to sort of really

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:28.700
sum over all these
possible states.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.460
An integral is obviously
an analytical operation.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.100
In practice, on a computer,
what we do is just

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.310
we discretize that
integral, and we take a sum.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.600
So it means that--

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.840
and again, I'll use two
dimension as an example.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.700
It means that if this
were my Brillouin Zone--

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.120
two-dimensional Brillouin
Zone, and my k vector

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.870
can be anywhere in
this Brillouin Zone,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.350
what I would need to do
is an integral overall

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.540
the possibilities inside there.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.730
But in practice,
what I'll do, I'll

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.010
just take a discretization.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.710
And I'll calculate
my band structure

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.150
at each one of these points,
and say a regular aqueous space

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.430
dimension of k points.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.220
And that's an
expensive operation.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.390
So each calculation
at each k point

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.790
will require a self-consistent
diagonalization

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.360
of your problem.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.410
And so really, the cost
of your calculation

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.350
is linearly scaling in
the number of k points.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:37.280
So in reality, you want to use
as few k points as possible.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.690
For a system like a
semiconductor or an insulator,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.160
in which if you want--

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.440
the band gap structure
is very smooth--

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.110
it becomes fairly easy to
integrate that smooth bands

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.700
with very coarse measures.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.580
So for something like silicon,
you might be already very happy

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.220
when you start to sample the
three-dimensional Brillouin

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.570
Zone with a uniform mesh of k
points that could have four k

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.830
points in each direction--

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.580
4 by 4, by 4, 6 by 6,
by 6, 8 by 8, by 8.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.060
And this is sort of the order
of magnitude of the k points

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.280
that you need to use.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.950
If you were to study for a
moment unit cell of silicon,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.320
you might want to study,
say, vacancy information

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.260
energy like you were doing in
your first computational lab.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.720
Then you are not going
to use two atom units.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.160
You are going to use
a larger unit cell.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.630
And without sort of
dwelling that much on it,

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.330
suppose that, again,
in two dimensions,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.780
you double the size
of your unit cell.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.680
What's really happening is that
the reciprocal lattice vectors

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.690
will become one half in length.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.730
So remember this
general concept.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.180
When you sort of increase
the size of the unit cell,

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.210
the reciprocal cell
becomes smaller.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.010
Suppose that we have doubled--

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.640
we have gone from
two atoms in each--

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.190
two atoms in our unit cell to--

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.990
well, if we are
in two dimensions,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.430
eight atoms in the unit cell.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.880
We have doubled in real
space-- in reciprocal space.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.700
Our Brillouin Zone
becomes 4 times smaller.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:22.040
And so if we want to keep the
same quality of integration,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.030
actually, it means that our
k point sampling needs only

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.840
to be one fourth the number
of points that we had before.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.170
That is we still
use the blue points

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.450
that are included in this sort
of smaller blackish unit cell.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.460
So that also means that, say,
if 64 k points is a good number

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.000
for a regular set of unit
cell of two atoms of silicon,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.310
if now you are
going to use a, say,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.580
unit cell that has
maybe 128 atoms--

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.530
much larger to calculate the
vacancy formation energy--

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.930
you really need only one k point
to calculate your total energy

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.200
with the same accuracy.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.730
So there is this general
idea of scaling and folding.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.730
You make your real space
calculation larger.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.840
You actually need to
use fewer k points.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.340
And if you are familiar with
sort of some of the solid state

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.860
ideas, that also
just means that when

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.260
you double the size
of your unit cell,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.920
you are really refolding
some of this band

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.480
structure in a smaller space.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.450
So you actually sum over a
number of bands that increases.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.270
The situation is
slightly more complex

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.060
for something like a metal.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.478
The sort of
fundamental difference

00:14:37.478 --> 00:14:39.020
when you deal with
a metal as opposed

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.300
to a semiconductor
or an insulator

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.900
is that there is something
called a Fermi energy.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.680
That is now there
isn't any more a gap,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.050
so the total charge
density is again

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.990
given by sum of the states,
sum over all the bands,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.090
and integral over
all the k space.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.810
But really, the total
charge density--

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.300
so the ultimate
integral that would

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.180
be the number of
electrons depends really

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.130
on where we stop.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.830
And there isn't any more
sort of natural separation

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.080
between empty and
occupied states.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.120
So there is going to be
in a metal an energy level

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.290
that determines what is
occupied and what is empty,

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.060
and that's the Fermi energy.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:33.850
So for copper I think has
11 electrons per unit cell

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.360
sort of FCC metal
with one atom per--

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.460
one atom in each unit cell.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.420
What we really need to do
in our electrons calculation

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.960
is find what is
this energy level.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.380
That is find what is
this Fermi energy, such

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.150
that the integral over all
the state below that level

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.910
gives us the right charge
density-- in particular,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.520
the right number of electrons.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.010
And this is sort of one of
the difficulties that come out

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.890
in metals, because now
what we are trying to do

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:11.740
is we are trying to integrate
the bands below a level--

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.150
below the black line.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.270
And so you really introduce a
discontinuity in your integral.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.720
And so to calculate
integrals of discontinuous

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.010
function usually requires
a much finer accuracy

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.790
in your k point sampling.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.400
And so the calculation tends
to become much more expensive.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.080
Nothing else.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:38.110
So the general solution to this
problem besides using a larger

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.800
number of k points,
and particular accuracy

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.670
to this sampling issue is that
of introducing what is called

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.230
a finite electron temperature.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.480
So what is actually done in sort
of every practical calculation

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.270
is introduce a small
amount of temperature

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.840
so that in reality, there's
a sharp discontinuity become

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.430
smoother.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.410
Because when you have
an electron temperature,

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.369
states above the Fermi energy
can be slightly occupied

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:09.040
with the Fermi [INAUDIBLE]
occupation, and states

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.240
just below the Fermi energy
can be slightly empty.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.339
So to summarize, I
mean, we need to be

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.910
careful in sort of sampling.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.730
And that's the other sort
of fundamental parameter

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.109
of your calculation.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.730
If you are dealing
with a metal, you

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.280
need to be particularly
careful, and you

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.880
need to use electron
temperature techniques.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.900
If you are using sort of-- if
you are studying an insulator

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.390
a semiconductor,
what you usually do

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.890
is just use a regular
equi-spaced mesh of k points.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.290
And that sort of
known in the community

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.760
with a technical name.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.370
They are called [INAUDIBLE]
for some very good reason.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.160
Actually, there
are some actually

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.230
fairly beautiful
symmetry thoughts

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:58.690
on why equi-spaced coarse
mesh can work very well.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.700
But in practice,
it's nothing else

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.690
than choosing the blue points
inside of the green Brillouin

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.800
zone.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.520
If you are studying a
really large system,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.240
you can actually reduce
yourself to sampling only one

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.410
point in the Brillouin Zone.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.570
Brillouin Zone has
become so small

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.986
that just taking sort of--

00:18:20.986 --> 00:18:22.090
how do you call it?

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.840
A mean-- the
theorem of the mean.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.030
That is, you can
substitute the integral

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.150
with the value of the
function at one point.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.160
And usually, you
have two choices.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.010
You can just use
the gamma point.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.110
This means that 0, 0, 0--

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.880
that has a
computational advantage.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.070
When you sample things
at the gamma point,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.820
you can choose your functions
to be real instead of complex.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.360
And so you have right away
your computational cost.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.610
Or you can choose sort of what
could be the best single point

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.840
for your given symmetry
that's sometimes

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.890
called the Baldereschi point.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.070
And that can be
again sort of useful

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.880
if you need to do an accurate
calculation in a large scale

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.040
system.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.960
Once you have set these
two fundamental parameters,

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.120
you are really
ready to do actually

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.980
a practical calculation.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.730
And so as I said, we have a
self-consistent Hamiltonian,

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.560
and so what you
need to do is you

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.940
need to iterate your problem
until the eigenstates

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.670
that you find give you
a charge density that

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.770
is identical to
the charge density

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.610
that you have done before.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.240
So in practice, how would your
electronic structure code work?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.690
Well, first you would tell
your code where the atoms are.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.710
So you need to specify
the position of the atom.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.200
Suppose that you are studying
silicon, you could sort of--

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.840
since you know actually what
is the structure of silicon,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.450
you could already put
them in the origin,

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.140
and in the position one
fourth, one fourth, one fourth.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.760
And then you need to
specify in particular

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.330
which flavor of
non-local pseudopotential

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.800
you are going to use.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.440
That is, there will be a
library of pseudopotential

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.760
that basically represents a
silicon atom with all the core

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.070
electrons frozen.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.570
And there are sort of a number
of technicalities that you'll

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.180
see in the lab on which
one you should choose,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.420
but they are sort of more or
less all the same, at least

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.080
from this point of view.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.720
Once the code knows
where the atoms are--

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.700
that is, knows the position of
the atoms inside the unit cell,

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.950
knows what is the
shape of the unit cell,

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.810
and what is the length
of the dotted lattice

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.590
vectors, this infinite
array of atoms,

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.110
the infinite crystalline,
or amorphous,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.320
or disordered extended
system is set.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.380
And what we really need to do is
throw the electron [? seeds ?]

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.110
and let the electron find
their own ground state.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.830
And so we need to make sure
that we have the right basis set

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.330
cutoff.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.705
That is, we are
going to describe

00:20:53.705 --> 00:20:56.710
the orbitals [? anchored. ?]
We have the right sampling.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.170
And at this point,
we can sort of

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.650
start the self-consistent
procedure.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.110
And in the sort
of simplest form,

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.780
well, we first need
to figure out what

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.880
is our Hamiltonian operator.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.970
The Hamiltonian, remember,
depends on the charge density

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.730
itself, because some of the
terms in the Hamiltonian,

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.310
like the Hartree energy,
the Hartree potential

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.140
of the exchange
correlation potential

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.620
depends on the density.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.000
So we need to pick an initial
guess for a trial charge

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.080
density.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.360
It could just be a superposition
of atomic charge density.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.400
Once we have the
charge density, we

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.870
can construct the Hamiltonian,
the [INAUDIBLE] Hamiltonian.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.640
The kinetic energy operator is--

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.540
we always know it.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.140
But we can construct
this Hartree and exchange

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.050
correlation terms that
depend on the charge density,

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.870
and then we'll have
the external potential

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:54.640
that is given by this array
of non-local pseudopotential.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.580
At this point, we
have the Hamiltonian,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.800
and we try to find
the lowest energy

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.950
eigenstates for Hamiltonian.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.900
In particular, we just need to
calculate a number of states

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.750
that is equal to the
number of occupied orbitals

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.080
if we are dealing
with a semiconductor,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.820
or it's equal to the
number of sort of electrons

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.080
plus 20%, 30% in a
metal to make sure

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.810
that at different points
in the Brillouin Zone,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.960
we calculate all
the bends that could

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.930
be below our Fermi energy.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.350
So we solve this.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.250
And this is really
the expensive step--

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.940
and I mean very expensive step
in any electronic structure

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.900
calculation.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.470
And there are sort
of a number of ways

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.340
of diagonalizing a
matrix, of solving

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.200
this eigenstate equation.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.380
In a basic set, it
tends to be very large.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.390
When you do sort of a realistic
calculation, even for silicon,

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.350
you could have hundreds
of plane waves, So.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.750
Hundreds of basic set elements.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.080
And large scale calculation
like you would doing in research

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.400
would contain tens of
thousands of plane waves.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.970
And actually, you don't--

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.880
you can't really diagonalize
on a regular computer

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.180
even a matrix that
has [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.290
If you think a matrix that
has a dimension of 1,000

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.490
requires one million elements.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:36.460
And one number-- a complex
number requires 16 bytes.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.780
So just a matrix that
has 1,000 sides that

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.790
will require 16 megabytes to
be described, and this number

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.070
explodes quadratically
very quickly.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.550
So you can construct
the full Hamiltonian,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.440
and you don't want
to calculate--

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.620
if you have a matrix
of dimension 1,000,

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.020
it will have 1,000 eigenstates.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.290
But you only care, say, if
you are studying silicon,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.930
on the lowest four eigenstates.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.450
So you want to have
numerical techniques that

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.350
calculate for you only the
lowest energy eigenstates.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.840
And there are a number of them
that are well-established.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.230
So now you have obtained
with one of these techniques

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.940
your lowest energy eigenstates,
and you sum their square moduli

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.160
to obtain the new
charge density.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.650
And with this, you
go back to the step.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.170
You construct the
Hamiltonian operator again,

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:34.420
you diagonalize new
density, and iterate.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.570
Of course, naturally,
a recipe like this

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.140
would most likely
never converge.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:47.380
So one needs to develop
a mixing approach--

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.040
mixing approaches that sort
make the change in the charge

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.000
density at every
iterative step smoother

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.720
than what I've described.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.510
So if you calculate
a new charge density

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.560
and you diagonalize it again,
your second new charge density

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.570
will be even more
different from anything

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.470
that you have obtained before.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.770
So what you really
do is you need

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:13.660
to find some schemes to
evolve in a very smooth way

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.930
your charge density.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.530
So maybe once you
have calculated

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.260
the new sum of
eigenstates, you don't

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.810
take that as huge as
density, but you just

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:27.310
update your old charge
density with 10%

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.210
of what you have calculated now
to try to make the iteration

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.730
to self-consistent very smooth.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.610
And I have to say a
lot of the know-how

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.350
in electronic
structure calculation

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.590
in the '90s has really
gone into trying

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.090
to find sort of mixing
approaches that evolve

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.400
our charge density
to solve consistency,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.870
and that converge under a
large variety of circumstances

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:58.030
for large or complex systems,
especially for metals.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:02.080
So stripped to
the bare elements,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.830
an electronic structure code
really needs to do two things.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.270
It needs to diagonalize
inexpensively

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.260
a Hamiltonian that expressed
on a plane wave basis

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.270
is a very large order.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.472
And I just mentioned
the names of some

00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:20.680
of the [? algorithm. ?]
Things like the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.440
and the [INAUDIBLE],, or some
of the conjugate gradient

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.810
algorithms are all
algorithms that

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:30.850
give us reasonable cost the
lowest energy eigenstates

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.380
of that Hamiltonian.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.930
And then once you
have that eigenstates,

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.000
you need to calculate
charge density,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.190
and you need to have
a mixing strategy.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.570
You need to have a strategy
to evolve your charge density

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.950
towards self-consistency.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:50.350
And that is also a
very tricky approach.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.640
There is a sort of
completely different approach

00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:01.270
to the problem that sees the
ground state solution not

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.950
as a self-consistent
iteration, but

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.580
as a nonlinear direct
minimization of the functional.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.590
If you remember, we have
the energy function--

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.220
or I think it's written
here in the next slide.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.150
No, it's not.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.600
We have sort of written the
density functional of theory

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.280
energy functional, and it
is a well-defined expression

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.810
of the orbitals only.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.070
It will be in one of the--

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.250
so the following slides
will pick it up again.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.250
And so we can also
see the problem

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:40.000
as the problem of minimization
of that functional in a space

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.970
that is very large, because
the sort of variables that we

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.020
really deal with are the
coefficients of our plane wave

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.100
expansion.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.800
But in principle-- and I'll
show you that in a moment--

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.610
we can actually write out
a minimization algorithm.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.420
The advantage of this approach,
if it's done properly,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.930
it has always a solution.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.730
If you keep minimizing
your energy, at the end,

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.580
you will get to a global
or to a local minimum.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.260
So this approach tends
to sort of converge

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.740
under every circumstances
if done properly, and done

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.410
properly is not trivial.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.920
But then sort of the efficiency
of the different things

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.590
is really system dependent.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.175
And I guess without wanting to
bore you with sort of math--

00:28:31.175 --> 00:28:34.130
so just I wanted
to remind you again

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.020
what happens in our computer.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.830
That is what happens when
we say we want to solve

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.500
this eigenstate equation.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.570
Supposing let's say we are in a
self-consistent diagonalization

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.410
approach.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.700
And as always, you have to
remember we expand our wave

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:58.310
function in a well-defined
set of orbitals--

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.420
that is our basis set.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.180
I represented here them as phi.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.070
And it could be plane waves,
it could be atomic orbitals.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.950
We use plane waves all the time.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.340
So really, in our
computer, our unknowns

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.720
are these coefficients of
this basis set expansion.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.150
And so our eigenstate equation,
once we multiply on the left

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:26.550
by phi and star, and integrate,
is really a matrix problem.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.530
So I've written it here as
just the same eigenfunction

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.520
equation written over there.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.190
And if we call hmn at the matrix
element of the Hamiltonian

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.920
between, say, two plane waves
of different wavelengths,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.380
this is what our problem means.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.510
It's just a linear
algebra problem.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:47.990
We need to find the
eigenvalues for which there

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.810
is a possible solution,
and the possible solution

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.980
will be eigenstates.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.050
And an eigenstate
is nothing else

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.930
than an appropriate
set of coefficients

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.190
that satisfy this equation,
and those coefficients put back

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.830
in here will give
us actually what

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.935
are the full eigenstates
of our problem.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.190
So this was the sort
of self-consistent

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.140
diagonalization.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.110
As I just said a
moment ago, we can also

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:24.220
look at the problem as a
nonlinear minimization problem.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.990
Once we have decided on an
approximation for our exchange

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.500
correlation functional, could be
a local density approximation,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.240
could be a generalized
gradient approximation.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.450
This is a well-defined
quantity in which,

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.090
again, the external
potential is given

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.120
by this array of
non-local pseudopotential.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.510
And the Hartree energy is just
the functional of the charge

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.320
density.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.630
And the charge
density itself is thus

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.600
the sum of the square
modulus of the orbitals.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.280
So in reality, this energy
is a function of that psi,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.380
or in other terms, is nothing
else than a very complex

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.540
function of those c1
to cn coefficients

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.320
of each eigenvector.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.780
So this is nothing else than
a minimization problem, again,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.160
on a number of variables
that can be 1,000 if you are

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.110
studying two atoms of silicon.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.060
And it can be in the tens
of hundreds of thousands

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.640
if you start to do really
serious calculations.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.300
So again, it's a
fairly complex problem.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.080
A huge number of variables
that you need to deal with,

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.450
and a nonlinear
expression for the energy.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:41.950
But again, in principle, if we
have this explicit expression

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:48.160
for the energy, E of psi,
where the psi that we consider

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.850
around only the occupied
orbitals, what we can do

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.350
is nothing else than take
the functional derivative

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.395
with respect to that psi.

00:31:57.395 --> 00:31:59.020
I'll consider them
real here just

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.200
to avoid sort of complex
conjugate numbers.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.350
And at the end,
this is nothing else

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:10.990
than calculates the derivative
of the energy with respect

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:16.720
to all the coefficients,
say, for i that goes 1 up

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.740
to the cutoff, all the
coefficients of all

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.110
the occupied orbitals.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.890
So you see, the larger
your system becomes,

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:34.630
the more basis elements
you'll need to use.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:38.350
I mean, if you double
the size of your system,

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.180
if you look at the
math, you'll actually

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.460
need the twice the
number of plane waves,

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.580
as it makes sense,
to describe a charge

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.350
density or a wave function
with the same resolution.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.530
So you double the
size of your system.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:55.000
The number of plane waves to
describe a single particle

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.630
orbital becomes twice
as large, but now you

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:02.440
will also have twice as
many occupied orbitals.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.420
So just the number
of this coefficient

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.100
has become four times as large.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.970
So again, this calculation
becomes very expensive

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:10.910
very quickly.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.340
But again, this is well-defined.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.180
I mean, we can just
actually write explicitly

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.700
the nonlinear function
of the previous slide

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.190
in terms of the coefficients
of the plane waves.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.110
This is actually done in
one of the article posted.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.870
There is a review of modern
physics by Mike Payne

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:33.580
and coworkers-- among others,
John [? Gianopulos ?] at MIT.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.710
And they actually
work out the algebra

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.360
of all these derivatives.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.430
And then once you
have the derivatives,

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.350
you have the
gradients, and you know

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:45.340
how to move along and go
to the minimum following

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.510
the gradients.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.530
The only difference with a sort
of regular minimization problem

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.560
is that this is a
constraint problem.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.970
That is what we have because
these are really electrons,

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.970
and not just sort of
arbitrary functions.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:06.080
The electrons need to be
meaningful quantum states,

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.929
so they need to be orthonormal.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:12.880
So this derivatives
with respect to the c

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.770
need actually to take
place on the hyper surface

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.100
where these conditions
are satisfied.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.310
That is, if you were to evolve
the coefficients of the plane

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.889
waves, what you would
find is that as soon

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.530
as you have sort of changed
them by a little amount,

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.260
your orbitals per
se are not going

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.520
to be orthonormal anymore.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.560
So this constraint is
sort of fundamental,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.389
and this is what
ultimately limits sort of--

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:47.710
or determines the computational
costs of our calculation.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.580
Because again, if we double
the size of the system,

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.909
we'll have twice as
many plane waves,

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:58.610
and we'll have twice as
many occupied orbitals.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.910
So we have already
a cost of fours.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.370
But those occupied
orbitals will need

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.410
to be orthogonal to each other.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.100
And so the number of
these matrix elements

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.340
that you need to calculate
has become also twice--

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.000
or the number of
orbitals in this matrix

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.260
have become twice, so the
number of matrix elements

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.300
has become four times as large.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.790
You see, we double the
size of the system,

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.920
we'll have twice as
many orbitals here,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.780
twice as many orbitals here.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.840
And this integral is
going to take place

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.030
on a region in space
that's twice as large.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.530
So 2 by 2, by 2 gives
us a factor of 8,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.090
and so gives us the,
ultimately, cubic scaling

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.180
of cost of density
functional calculation.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.260
You go from two atoms of silicon
to four atoms of silicon,

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.700
your calculation has become
eight times more expensive.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.930
Hartree-Fock in its
original formulation scales

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.400
as the fourth power.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.880
Other quantum chemistry approach
scales as the fifth, sixth,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.330
or seventh power.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:06.550
So it becomes very easy
to sort of reach, really,

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.500
the limit of
calculation that you

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.140
can do on a regular
computer or even

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.850
on a regular supercomputer.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.330
And there is a lot of effort
to develop what are called

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.980
linear scaling approaches.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.190
That these electronic structure
algorithm that scale linearly

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.960
as the size of the system.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.360
And somehow, they are
all based on the idea

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.840
that sort of physics or
quantum mechanics is local.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.320
So if your orbital at
the end is ultimately

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.510
localized in a certain
region of space,

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.800
it will be automatically
orthogonal to orbitals

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.240
that are very far away.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.580
Because if this is
localized somewhere here,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.310
and this psi i is
localized somewhere there,

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.410
their overlap will
be 0 by definition,

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:51.550
and so we don't need to
worry about orthogonality.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.250
So somehow, locality
of physics, locality

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.320
of quantum mechanics
in principle

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.870
tells us that there are
linear scaling approaches that

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.300
could work, although,
none of them

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.140
have really made into sort of
production electronic structure

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.010
at this stage, although there
is a lot of ongoing effort

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.130
in many groups.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.720
So with this [INAUDIBLE]
we conclude also

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.760
all the technicalities.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.860
And what we'll do in
the rest of the class

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.540
will give you a sort
of panorama of what

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.610
typical applications of density
function of theory calculation

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.920
are going to do.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:42.230
And I'll go very
quickly over this.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.020
I have here sort
of cases in which

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.580
we could be interested in
structural excitations.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:55.370
So when you start warming up a
system, a molecule, or a solid,

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:59.990
you start exciting the different
normal modes of your molecule

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.980
or of a solid.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.190
I've shown you some of the
possibilities for something

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.310
like a carbon nanotube,
because that band--

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.110
we have a banding mode up there.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.830
We have a pinching mode, and
we have a breathing mode.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.030
And so these are all
the possible structural

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.010
excitations, and
you can actually

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.170
calculate this structural
excitations using

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.660
density functional theory.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:28.160
And I've given here a comparison
between the case of diamond--

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.790
what is calculated with the
sort of state of the art

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:33.590
[INAUDIBLE] code
like you are going

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.800
to see in your
laboratory, and what

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.230
is measured actually
with the neutron

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.970
scattering, the red dots.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:45.140
So you see without really
any input parameters.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.110
And once you have really
phonon dispersion,

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.620
you can calculate all the
thermodynamics of solids.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.550
That is really basically
based on the statistics

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.250
of excitation of this
vibrational degrees of freedom.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.480
So you could calculate, say,
how your elastic constant

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.790
for your bulk models
changes with temperature,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.210
and this is the
calculated black line,

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.240
and you could compare
it with experiments.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.370
Or you could take
one of your slabs

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.910
like you have seen in the first
laboratory in which you were

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.510
calculating the surface
energy, and you could actually

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.650
put it in motion.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.410
You could follow at a
given time temperature

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.540
the dynamics of the atoms.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.970
And you want to have
a slab thick enough

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:33.110
so the atoms in the middle
really act as bulk atoms.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.180
They don't see the
presence of the surface,

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.600
and then it becomes very
easy to investigate what's

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.710
happening on the surface.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.990
And so you can have sort
of a snapshot of sort

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:49.820
of how the atoms are moving
on the outer layers, what

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.890
are the sort of
typical displacements

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.840
of typical mean
square displacements.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.730
Or you can say study how the
distance between the layers

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.360
evolved with temperature.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.900
So you can look at, say,
how, as you increase

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.240
the temperature of
your slab, the distance

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.370
between the surface layer
and the second layer

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.960
changes with temperature.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.090
And this would be
the computation,

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.090
and here we have the
experimental value.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:17.660
And there are sort of lots
of interesting physics

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.840
that takes place,
again, if you look

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.540
at the distance between
the second and third layer,

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.630
if the red line above and
the system expands there.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.970
And sort of with
computation, you can actually

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:33.920
probe your system deeper and
deeper, where experiment starts

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.530
to become very difficult.
It's almost impossible

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.590
to look at what the fourth
layer in a surface does,

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.190
and what the fifth
layer of a surface does.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.530
I think in order to keep
the balance of the lecture,

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.720
I'll actually switch on to
Professor [? Sidor's ?] part

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.720
so he can show you some
of the other application.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.710
And if we have time either
in one of the next classes,

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:59.480
I'll show you some of
the other applications

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.630
that we have mentioned.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.370
So I think I'll pass over
the lecture to Professor

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.610
[? Sidor. ?]

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.180
PROFESSOR 2: So Professor
[? Mazari ?] already gave you

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.788
some generic applications.

00:41:12.788 --> 00:41:14.580
What I want to do for
the rest of the class

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.360
is actually give
you some numbers,

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:22.670
and really look seriously at
what the typical accuracies are

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.733
that you can expect
from what we'll

00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:27.150
call density functional theory,
but what we mean with that

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.860
is sort of standard
density function theory

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.500
as we kind of explain
it to you in the class

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.080
in the local density
or generalized gradient

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.710
approximation.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.370
So these are sort of staples
of electronic structure methods

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.870
now.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:44.030
But that doesn't mean that
there are, in some cases, not

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:48.020
already better forms out
there, but they're often

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.780
very much in the research stage,
and there wouldn't be things

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.660
that you would either
easily do on real problems.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.280
You wouldn't get
your hands on them,

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.663
and you wouldn't necessarily
easily learn from them.

00:41:57.663 --> 00:41:59.330
So again, what we're
going to talk about

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:06.602
is the kind of standard staple
of electronic structure.

00:42:06.602 --> 00:42:09.060
Before I did that, I want to
say a little bit about a topic

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.350
we haven't touched
about, which is

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:14.730
what's called the spin
polarized version of density

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.920
functional theory.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.990
If you remember, the
Hohenberg-Kohn theorem,

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.890
everything is, in
essence, expressed

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.710
in terms of the charge density.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.930
Everything is a function
of the charge density.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:33.780
And the electron spin never
explicitly appears in there.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.880
But of course,
electrons have spin.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.250
If you don't consider any
coupling with the angular

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.650
momentum, it's really
just up or down

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:46.050
spin, so plus or minus
a half [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:47.940
And we'll treat
here, in the lecture,

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.260
spin as a scalar quantity.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.070
So really, spin is
just up or down--

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.860
plus 1 or minus 1, or
plus a 1/2, or minus a 1/2

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.540
in the appropriate units.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.390
And in reality,
spin, as soon as it

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:05.010
applies to the angular momentum,
becomes a vector quantity.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.190
Also as soon as it couples
to a magnetic field

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.350
from the environment, it
becomes a vector quantity.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.840
And people do that
now already, treating

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.880
spin as a vector quantity, but
most codes that you will use,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.760
spin will simply be
treated as a scalar, which

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.360
is fine for most purposes.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.360
We tend to refer to them
as just up and down spin.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.900
I'll often write that with
the either up and down arrow.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:41.140
Now why do you actually need
to treat the electron spin?

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.890
Let me just sort of give
you a refresher of why

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.930
you need to deal with the spin.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.230
Well, the reason is the Pauli
Exclusion Principle really.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.410
Is that the Pauli Exclusion
Principle tells you that two

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.290
electrons cannot be in exactly
the same quantum state.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.740
Remember that?

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:03.690
So that means that if you have
two up electrons approaching

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:10.650
each other, versus say an
up and a down electron,

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.050
these will approach
each other differently.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:18.790
Because these two are
in the same spin state,

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.030
so if you bring them
very close together,

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.880
they essentially now get
the same coordinate as well.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.930
So they almost have the
same quantum numbers now,

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.180
and the Pauli exclusion
principle prevents that.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.410
So the Pauli Exclusion
Principle keeps electrons

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:39.390
with parallel spin essentially
away from each other.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.170
Whereas if you have electrons
with empty parallel spin,

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.917
even if these are at
the same position,

00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:46.500
they don't have the
same spin, so they

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.400
don't have the same
set of quantum numbers,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.020
so the Pauli Exclusion
Principle doesn't act on them.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.730
And the Pauli
Exclusion Principle

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.870
is essentially something
that keeps the electrons away

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.060
without an explicit term
for it in the Hamiltonian.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.820
It's not like-- the coulombic
interaction, of course,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.362
keeps electrons away
from each other.

00:45:05.362 --> 00:45:06.737
But the Pauli
Exclusion Principle

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.520
is essentially
something on top of that

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.490
that comes from
anti-symmeterizing the wave.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.250
You don't see it
directly in the form--

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.710
as a term in the form
of the Hamiltonian.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.780
And if you remember,
consequences of--

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.380
it's going to take forever--

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.390
the Pauli Exclusion
Principle is Hund's rule.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:29.570
That if you remember
atomic d level,

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:35.040
say, for example, if you
add electrons to, say,

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.810
five d levels, you're going
to add them with parallel spin

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.530
first, because again, then
the Pauli Exclusion Principle

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.060
is satisfied.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:50.010
And then you start filling them
with the anti-parallel levels.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.580
So this is going to
carry over in atoms--

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.830
in solids-- I'm sorry.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.440
Basically, if those five, say--

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.150
let's focus on d levels.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.730
If they remain degenerate--

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.620
so they remain roughly
at the same level,

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.290
you're going to fill them
according to Hund's rule.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.860
And that's what I've shown here.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.550
So in solids,
these d levels will

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.130
split a little, which
is what I've shown here,

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.280
but they don't split a lot.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.070
Then you're actually going to
fill them with parallel spin.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.600
And so if that's the
case, you have a lot

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.420
of magnetic moment on your ion.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.170
You have five
electron spins here.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:32.670
You have no down spin, so you
have a strong magnetic moment.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:35.920
And I'll show in a second
where that becomes important.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.380
On the other hand,
let's say you're

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.190
in an environment that
splits off two of these,

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.350
but so much higher.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.340
At some point, you won't
satisfy Hund's rule anymore,

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.770
because the energy
cost of-- let's say

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.930
after you put in these
three green electrons, now

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.310
you have to add two more.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.930
You have five electrons.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.430
To fill them with
parallel spin, you

00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:59.930
would have to put them here.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.700
But since those levers
are so much higher,

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.620
you basically want to pay
the exchange penalty--

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.810
they call it the
Hund's rule penalty--

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:10.760
to put them in a lower
orbit when you put them

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.300
in with anti-parallel.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.880
So in some sense, whether you
get a lot of magnetic spin--

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.500
a lot of magnetic
moment left over

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:22.400
depends on how much your
orbital will split in the end.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.900
But I'm going to
show you in the end

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.810
that it can actually have
significant consequences

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.840
on the physical properties
of your material.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.320
So in your density
functional calculation,

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.290
you will carry a
magnetic moment locally

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.930
when the up density and the
down density are not the same.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:45.100
And so I've sort of
already given away here

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.220
how this problem is dealt with
in density functional theory.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:54.290
The interesting thing is that
if you think about it very hard,

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.600
you shouldn't have
to deal with spin

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.010
in density functional theory.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.510
Somehow, it put me
back at my old picture.

00:48:17.015 --> 00:48:20.000
In principle, remember
where we told you that--

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.160
Professor [? Mazari ?]
told you that the energy

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.290
and the potential is a
function of the charge density?

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.380
So the charge itself
should actually

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.710
also contain the information
about electron spin

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.140
and magnetic moment, even
though it doesn't explicitly

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.060
contain that.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.980
But for a given
charge density, there

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.590
would probably be a certain
amount of spin polarization.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.980
So it should all be in that
functional, but remember,

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.620
that's the functional
that we don't know.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.825
And so in practice, that
doesn't work very well.

00:48:52.825 --> 00:48:54.200
So what we do is
we really helped

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.387
density functional theory
along by treating the up

00:48:57.387 --> 00:48:59.743
and the down density separately.

00:48:59.743 --> 00:49:01.160
But again, you
should keep in mind

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.660
that in principle,
in the formalism

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.430
of density functional theory,
you wouldn't have to do that.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:10.370
So if you do what's called,
say, the local spin density

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.910
approximation, which is the spin
polarized version of the Local

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:17.750
Density Approximation-- and
so goes under the name LSD--

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.290
Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds, or LSDA.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.440
And there's a version of that
for the GGA, which nobody--

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.380
often people will just
call it LDA or GGA,

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.710
but they will call it sometimes
spin polarized LDA or GGA.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.590
What you do there is that
you have a separate density

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.750
for the up electrons
and a separate density

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:42.680
for the down electrons, and the
two will interact differently.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.470
So the up/up will--

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.950
up will interact
differently with up,

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.300
with up, then up with down.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.670
And that comes from the way
the exchange correlation

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.590
potentials are defined.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:58.600
So I think Professor
[? Mazari ?] mentioned

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.690
restricted and unrestricted
to Hartree-Fock before

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.135
very briefly, and this is
essentially the same idea.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:12.890
Sort of one quick tip
I want to give you

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:17.150
is that if you have spin
polarized materials,

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.510
it's often much more useful
to look at spin densities

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.700
than at charge densities.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.220
One of the really cool things
about doing quantum mechanics

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.470
is that you can actually
look at the charge densities,

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.140
and look at the electrons,
which most people get

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.720
very excited about the first
time they do quantum mechanics.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.090
It's kind of cool-- you can
look at where the electrons go.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.507
Well, the first
thing you learn is

00:50:36.507 --> 00:50:39.290
that you don't see much when
you look at charge densities.

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:41.720
You typically see
big blobs of charge,

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.930
and it's very hard to see
any fine structure of bonding

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.700
in blobs of charge density.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.370
And I wanted to
show you an example.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.760
Here's lithium cobalt oxide.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.080
It's a transition metal oxide.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.370
It's a layered material--
layers of oxygen

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.660
here-- the red things.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.270
And then layers of cobalt,
and layers of lithium.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:01.180
And if you plot the
charges in a plane--

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:05.415
this is actually a plane
in the plane of the figure.

00:51:05.415 --> 00:51:06.790
If you look at
the charges-- this

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:08.470
is a picture of
the charge density.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:11.200
You see big blobs, and you
see the oxygen layers here.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.510
And where the
oxygens are 2 minus,

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.102
so remember that you're showing
only the valence electrons.

00:51:16.102 --> 00:51:17.810
So these have a lot
of valence electrons,

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.530
and so you see a
lot of intensity.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:23.590
Cobalt has somewhat less
valence electrons on it,

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.360
so you see less intensity here.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.770
And lithium is ionized
to lithium plus,

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.920
so it has no valence
electrons on it,

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.160
so you see almost nothing here.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:36.490
But in essence, this doesn't
give you a lot of detail.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:41.160
If you actually take a
material like this, and rather

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.120
than plot the charges, you plot
the spin polarization density.

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.100
So let's say up minus
down, or down minus up.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.830
So it's how much magnetic
moment there is locally.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.428
You get much cleaner pictures.

00:51:54.428 --> 00:51:55.470
This is the same picture.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:56.790
It's a slightly
different material

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:57.960
with different ions in it.

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.480
It's with nickel
and manganese in it.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.850
But here's the
oxygen. By the way,

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.950
I should have told you
red is the neutral color

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.740
in this picture, so it's 0.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.060
So now you don't see
the oxygen at all,

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.910
and the reason is oxygen
doesn't have spin.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:12.888
It's a filled shell.

00:52:12.888 --> 00:52:15.180
Every time you have filled
shells, you don't have spin.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.390
So looking at spin density
often allows you to filter out

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:21.090
certain ions, and you
really-- the transition metals

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:24.390
tend to have spin on them,
and you see that very clearly.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.300
So it's often a trick that I
just wanted to share with you.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.190
So I want to go in sort
of the last half hour--

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:39.230
is go through the kind
of numerical accuracy,

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:43.340
and then slowly try to connect
that to the physical accuracy

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.840
that you get in properties.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.780
So if you want to use--

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.120
have initial methods in
density functional theory

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.670
to get to engineering
properties,

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.280
a lot of steps you have to
make, because in the end,

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.408
we calculate simple things.

00:52:56.408 --> 00:52:58.700
We've got to get charge
densities, and band structures,

00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.720
and energies.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.320
And you'll talk
later to somebody,

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.550
and they want to know what's the
corrosion resistance of this.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.280
And corrosion resistance
is not a quantum operator,

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.010
so you need to
take a lot of steps

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.730
to go from the simple, what I
would call primitive output,

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.260
to engineering properties.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.060
But before you even
take that step,

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.310
you need to understand
the kind of accuracy--

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:21.920
how reliable your output is.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.698
And so I collected
a lot of results.

00:53:25.698 --> 00:53:27.740
And I was going to start
with the simple things--

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.238
the energies of the atoms.

00:53:30.238 --> 00:53:32.780
So here's a collection, and it
looks like a bunch of numbers,

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.980
but there's a very
systematic trend in it.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.627
So what I show for
a bunch of atoms--

00:53:36.627 --> 00:53:38.960
and these all should have a
minus sign in front of them,

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.230
because if you sum up all the
electronic states in the atom,

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:46.218
they're obviously binding,
so they should be negative.

00:53:46.218 --> 00:53:48.260
So there's always the
experimental line, at least

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.670
for most of them.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:54.540
The LDA number, and then
the GGA with a fairly recent

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.730
implementation of the
exchange correlation function.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:01.770
And so if you look
carefully at the numbers,

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:05.260
let's take one here-- let's
take carbon for example.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.330
So experiment is 275688.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:11.970
Oops, that wasn't good.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:17.130
LDA, the binding energy
is somewhat weaker--

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.380
almost is an
electron volt weaker.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:24.420
And GGA is slightly
closer to the experiment.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.460
That's typically
what you'll see.

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.020
If you look at all
the other atoms,

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.890
you'll see a very
systematic trend.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:38.070
In the LDA, in the atoms, the
electrons are not bound enough.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:43.838
In the GGA, They are somewhat
closer to the experiment.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:50.040
It gets more interesting
when you look at molecules,

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.870
because now you can talk about
a physical binding energy.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:56.340
And so the one we look at
here is for very simple

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.720
diatomic molecules.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.010
What's their binding energy?

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.690
So what's their energy
to pull them apart?

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.900
So if you think about
it, you have a molecule--

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.980
has an ab.

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.830
This is the vector between them.

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:16.690
You'll have sort of something
that looks like this.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.100
And so we're looking at
what's that well depth here--

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.050
the binding energy.

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:28.770
If you look at hydrogen, H2,
you have the experimental number

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.410
here, the LDA number.

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.450
You see now that
the LDA number--

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:35.610
that the binding is too strong.

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:38.310
The H2 molecule is
bound too strongly.

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:39.240
It's not so bad.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.620
It's only about 5% in hydrogen.
And the GGA, the binding

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.720
is too weak.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.455
For reference, I've also put
uncorrected Hartree-Fock here.

00:55:49.455 --> 00:55:51.330
Professor [? Mazari ?]
showed you essentially

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:54.870
what Hartree-Fock is,
which is essentially

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.260
having the Hartree term for
the self-consistent Coulomb

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.420
interaction from
the other electrons,

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.870
and the exact exchange with
no correlation effects.

00:56:06.476 --> 00:56:09.810
This is an interesting one that
you will actually often use--

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:13.920
O2-- any time you look
at oxidation reactions,

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.820
for example.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:20.160
Experiment-- oxygen is only
about minus 5.2 ev binding.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.590
LDA binds by a
whopping 7 and 1/2.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.390
So you're more than
two electron volts off.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.080
GGA gets you a little
closer in this case.

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:38.815
Uncorrected Hartree-Fock
is off the charts.

00:56:38.815 --> 00:56:40.690
And this is something
you'll generically see.

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.185
Uncorrected Hartree-Fock,
very few people

00:56:43.185 --> 00:56:44.560
would actually
use that any more.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.990
It's sort of for binding
energies way off the charts.

00:56:49.966 --> 00:56:51.545
These things are important.

00:56:51.545 --> 00:56:53.170
If you now-- let's
say you want to look

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.460
at an oxidation reaction.

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.050
So that means that
at some point,

00:56:57.050 --> 00:57:00.320
you're going to calculate
the state of an oxide,

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.380
and compare the chemical
potential of the oxygen

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:07.550
there to that of oxygen gas.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:11.215
So of course, you have a
big error in the oxygen gas.

00:57:11.215 --> 00:57:12.840
The question is, how
much of that error

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.590
carries over to the solid?

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.620
If you make exactly the
same error in the solid,

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.280
then the reaction energy
is perfect, Because.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.310
You're going to
subtract the two.

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.745
And a lot of
practical things you

00:57:23.745 --> 00:57:25.120
do with density
functional theory

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.680
depend on error cancellation.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:32.020
The thing is that you will
have more error cancellation

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:36.603
as the states that you subtract
are more physically similar.

00:57:36.603 --> 00:57:38.020
But the problem
is, let's say, you

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.810
look at oxidation of a metal--
aluminum plus oxygen going

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:43.300
to aluminum oxide.

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.190
The oxygen in
aluminum oxide is very

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:47.660
different from the oxygen
in the O2 molecule,

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.800
so not all the
error will cancel.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.047
Let's say it was so bad
that you kept 2 ev error.

00:57:56.047 --> 00:58:00.160
So 2 ev error in the
molecule is one ev per oxygen

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.770
if you want to think
of it that way.

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:06.540
If you're not careful about
it, that's an enormous effect.

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.000
Think about it-- the
chemical potential which

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.040
relates directly
to the energy goes

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.500
like the logarithm of the
partial pressure of oxygen.

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:19.340
Remember that mu is
mu 0 plus rt log p?

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.470
So if now you invert
that, that means your--

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:24.470
if you wanted to calculate, say,
a partial pressure of oxygen

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:28.210
at which something oxidized,
your oxygen pressure

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:32.280
goes exponentially
with the energetics.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.790
So if you have a 1 ev
error at room temperature,

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:40.620
your error in the
oxygen pressure

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.200
is the exponential
of one ev over kt,

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.440
which is off the charts.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.670
So you have to be a little
careful with these kinds

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:51.830
of error calibrations.

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:54.680
Fortunately, we'll
see later when

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.140
we look at reaction between
solids, most of the error

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.560
tends to cancel, and we get
much, much better accuracy.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.860
If all our reaction energies
were wrong by one ev,

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.150
we wouldn't be here.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:07.230
We'd be out of business.

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:09.740
But you have to keep in
mind that you get less error

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:14.517
cancellation as the states
you're comparing are different.

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.850
The more they're different,
the less error cancellation.

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.380
That's sort of a rule of thumb.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.240
And so going from
a gas to a solid

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.860
is a significant difference.

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.810
Often, what people
do is that if you

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.030
want to get practical
results, they'll

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.730
add a correction to this
which they fit at one point.

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.360
So these are the
small molecules.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.380
Let's go to the solids.

00:59:38.265 --> 00:59:39.890
Here I don't have
the binding energies,

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.350
but I have the
lattice parameters.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:44.200
But you'll see
something that's very

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.697
consistent with the molecules.

00:59:46.697 --> 00:59:48.280
If you look at the
lattice parameters,

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.620
you compare, say,
the experimental ones

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.360
versus the LDA ones.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.510
What you'll see is that the
LDA ones almost always--

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.707
and I think always in
this case are smaller.

00:59:58.707 --> 01:00:00.790
Actually, yeah, because
the difference is actually

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:02.230
negative.

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.450
The GGA results
are always bigger.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.230
This is rather consistent
whatever material you do.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:15.640
You will find almost always
that the LDA gives you

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.480
lattice parameters that are too
small by a factor of a percent,

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.720
sometimes, 2%.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.560
And so people refer to that
as the over-binding of LDA.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.660
LDA binds somewhat too strongly.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.220
Remember you saw that in
the molecules as well.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.340
Oxygen had a 7 ev
binding energy,

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.270
and it should only have
a 5 ev binding energy.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.020
And so in solids, the
way that comes out

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.520
is that your equilibrium lattice
parameters are slightly too

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.020
small.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.140
Actually, I'm not sure that
I know of a single result

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.800
where LDA gives a lattice
parameter that's too big.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.957
I've seen that on some
occasions in papers,

01:00:49.957 --> 01:00:52.290
but it's almost always an
indication that the people did

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:54.843
the calculation wrong.

01:00:54.843 --> 01:00:56.260
Actually, an LDA
lattice parameter

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.840
that agrees with experiment
is usually wrong--

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.390
a wrong calculation.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:04.032
GGA is much more unpredictable.

01:01:04.032 --> 01:01:06.490
The ones that I've shown here
because they're simple metals

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:08.650
and semiconductors give
you a lattice parameter

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:10.120
that's too large.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.190
In GGA, it's actually
also possible to get

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:14.630
a lattice parameter that's
too small, although it's rare.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.260
Most of the time, you're
on the higher side,

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.200
but it's less predictable,
and that's sort of slightly

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.700
problematic with the GGA.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.315
In LDA, a good
guess of the lattice

01:01:24.315 --> 01:01:26.440
parameters-- you calculate
your lattice parameters,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.120
and you know you're
on the low side.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.560
You always know that the
real lattice parameter

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.550
is going to be bigger.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:34.660
In GGA, it's slightly
more difficult to predict

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.370
on which side you are.

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:38.890
But in metals, you do tend
to be on the high side.

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:44.140
That actually has consequences
for other properties,

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.330
like the bulk modulus.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.420
If you compare, say, the
experimental bulk modulus

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.810
to the LDA one, s you'll find
is that in almost all cases--

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.810
and I think in all cases
that I've shown-- well,

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.150
all cases except silicon--

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.650
the LDA bulk modulus
is too large,

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.890
so the material is
too stiff that means.

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:06.880
And that kind of goes together
with the over-binding.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.760
Remember, the bonding
energy is too high,

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.698
the lattice parameter
is too small.

01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:13.990
All that is kind of in
agreement with the material also

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:15.040
being too stiff.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.220
As you compress the
material, it gets stiffer.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.800
GGA, most of the time, if
you see from deviations,

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.110
has to be on the other side.

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:25.120
It tends to be too soft.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.350
And bulk modulus
effects that will

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:34.150
transfer, for example, also
into vibrational frequencies.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.360
In material, when you're
too hard, too stiff,

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.070
you'll have higher
vibrational frequency.

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:40.870
When you're too
soft, you'll have

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:42.580
lower vibrational frequencies.

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:46.795
Here's the same for oxides.

01:02:46.795 --> 01:02:48.170
You're not exactly
learning a lot

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:51.050
new by looking at them, except
that in oxides, the errors just

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:52.175
tend to be slightly larger.

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:02.080
So here's the summary
for geometry prediction.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.170
You almost always-- and I
would probably say always--

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:07.090
under-predict with LDA.

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:10.540
Less systematic errors with GGA.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.450
For normal materials like
semiconductors and metals,

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:17.950
often, your errors are
confined to order 1% to 2%.

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:20.180
In transition metal oxides--
and if I have a chance,

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.722
I'll say a little
bit more about that

01:03:21.722 --> 01:03:25.450
later because they have
electronic structures where

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:30.680
the LDA and GGA approximations
are particularly harsh on.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.750
You tend to have
somewhat bigger errors.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:36.340
But I may say a little more
about that if we get to it.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:40.570
So I want to say something
about predicting structure,

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:44.300
and about the energy
scale that's required.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.300
So this is often
something you want to do.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.050
You want to know if I put my
energy in this arrangement,

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:52.398
is that lower in energy
than some other arrangement,

01:03:52.398 --> 01:03:54.940
so I can kind of predict what
the most stable arrangement is.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.898
So that could be [INAUDIBLE]
crystal structure,

01:03:56.898 --> 01:03:59.750
but it's the same for if
you look, say, at a surface.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.140
So I wanted to give you
a feeling for the scale

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.340
of energetic differences.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.260
So for vanadium, I've listed
the atomic energy here

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.700
in [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.025
This is the energy
of all its electrons,

01:04:12.025 --> 01:04:15.820
so not just the valence
electrons actually.

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.120
The energy for FCC
vanadium-- so remember,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.160
the first line is the
atom, not in a solid.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:31.550
The second line is the FCC iron,
and the third one is BCC iron.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:32.850
So look at the differences.

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.790
First of all, if
you go from the atom

01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:39.552
to the solid, your first four
digits don't even change.

01:04:39.552 --> 01:04:41.010
And again, that's
a reflection of--

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:44.140
well, a lot of your deep
core states don't change.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.870
But you would see
something similar even

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:47.995
with a pseudopotential
approximation where you only

01:04:47.995 --> 01:04:49.990
deal with the valence electrons.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:59.090
So the cohesive energy is only
0.03% of the total energy.

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:01.610
So if you're calculating--
the reason I'm saying this--

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.250
if you're calculating the
cohesive energy by first

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:07.160
calculating the total
energy of a solid,

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.780
and then calculating
atomic energy,

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.977
you'd better do these
things damn accurate,

01:05:10.977 --> 01:05:12.560
because you're going
to subtract them,

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.170
and most of what you
subtract is the same.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:18.140
So to get any significance
in your result,

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.540
you need to have high
numerical accuracy.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.670
And that's not a big
problem with a lot of code,

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.560
but I want you to
keep that in mind.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.040
But few people care about
the cohesive energy.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.770
Let's say you want to know
whether vanadium is FCC or BCC.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:38.110
So you could
calculate it as BCC.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:43.750
Now the FCC/BCC
difference is only 0.001%

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.640
of the total energy.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.530
And these are not
complicated structures.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:51.760
So in many cases, we're going
to work with energy differences

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.170
that are fractions of--

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:56.590
so that are 10 to the
minus 6, 10 to the minus 7

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.318
times the total energy.

01:05:58.318 --> 01:05:59.860
So it's sort of
telling you something

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:04.660
about how much numerical
accuracy you need.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.820
If you want to look
at mixing energies--

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.310
let's say I mix vanadium
with something else--

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.960
platinum-- and you
want to know what's

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.620
the mixing enthalpy, because
that sets the whole temperature

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:18.460
scale for mixing, the whole
phase diagram topology.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.810
That tends to be a fraction--

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:24.140
10 to minus 6, 10 to the
minus 7 of the total energy.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:28.030
So my former advisor used to
compare this to-- let's say

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:31.480
you want to know the
weight of a captain that

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.490
sails a big supertanker.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.680
It's like weighing the
tanker with the captain

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.210
and without the captain, and
looking at the difference,

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:40.510
and that's the weight
of the captain.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:44.750
You're almost at a kind of
relative scale like that here.

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:47.710
So the [? cute ?]
thing really is

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.990
that all these
approximations we make

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:55.120
to density functional theory
are obviously not this accurate.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.840
The total energy is not
accurate up to a fraction of 10

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.370
to the minus 6.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:03.400
The only reason we're here and
we can get physical behavior

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.430
right is because
a lot of the error

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.200
the density functional
theory makes in LDA

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.980
and GGA is systematic.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.070
And so a lot of it
cancels away when

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.290
you take energy differences.

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:18.790
When I do FCC and BCC vanadium,
yes, I may have an error of 10

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:21.640
to minus 4 in the
energy, but most of it

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.680
cancels away when I take
the energy difference.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.343
And that's why we're lucky.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:27.760
But you have to
keep that in mind,

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.070
because again, the less
cancellation you have,

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:40.410
the bigger your
error on the result.

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:44.640
So again, let me show you how
well or how badly it does.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.950
So I did a very simple thing.

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:50.460
I looked at how well
does it predict, say,

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.010
the structure of the elements.

01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:57.430
This is done in GGA, a standard
[? Trudel ?] potential method.

01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:00.315
So this comes out-- you may
have to look at your hand

01:08:00.315 --> 01:08:04.290
out because this is extremely
fuzzy on the screen.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:07.860
In red, I did metals
that are experimentally

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:12.330
FCC, and green I did metals
that are experimentally BCC.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:15.510
Now what I show you is
the calculated energy

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.630
difference between FCC
and BCC, and it's actually

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:25.880
the first line below every
element kind of like this.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.920
And so when that's positive, the
BCC energy is higher than FCC,

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.670
so it's going to--

01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:32.859
FCC is preferred over BCC.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:40.120
If it's negative like here,
then BCC is preferred over FCC.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.220
And so if you look--
so the color is

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.910
the experimental result,
the number is calculated.

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:49.830
So if you look at them
carefully, they're all correct.

01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:51.569
It's negative when
we have green,

01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:57.569
it's positive when we have red.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.420
You can do a more
subtle comparison.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.399
Look at the difference
between HCP--

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.537
Hexagonal Close Pack-- and FCC.

01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:06.120
And the reason that
that's more subtle

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.450
is HCP FCC are much more alike.

01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:10.428
They're all close pack.

01:09:10.428 --> 01:09:11.970
It's just the
difference in stacking.

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:15.870
ab, ab, versus abc, abc.

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:18.030
And so again, you'll see
that they're all correct.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.500
The red ones are the FCC ones.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.870
They're the ones where that
first line is positive.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:29.069
By the way, that number is
in kilojoules per mole here.

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:32.790
The yellow ones, that
number is negative.

01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:40.840
So we get the structure of the
elements essentially correct.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.720
There are notable exceptions.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.520
In LDA, iron is wrong.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.850
Iron is FCC in LDA, not BCC,
but in GGA, that's corrected.

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:53.020
And then there are the weirdos.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.780
If you go deep down
in the periodic table,

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.120
especially f electron
metals have--

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.480
the f states are extremely
localized even in metals,

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.540
and so electron correlation
becomes very important here.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.290
And I may say a little
more about that.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:12.820
And so there you'll start
to see failures LDA and GGA.

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.730
An important one is plutonium.

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:18.650
Plutonium is kind of
important for obvious reasons,

01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:22.090
especially if you work at
national labs these days.

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:26.770
And so people are building
more sophisticated methods

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:30.550
to deal with materials
such as plutonium.

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:33.357
Typically, when you work with
f electron metals, sometimes,

01:10:33.357 --> 01:10:35.440
you'll get the answer
right, sometimes, you won't.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.005
But you should be a
little more careful.

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:43.910
Let me skip this.

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:45.650
You can get the--

01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:52.010
most of the time, you'll get the
structure of compounds right.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:54.530
If you go to transition
metal oxides--

01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:56.390
so I sort of went
from metallic elements

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:58.460
now to transition metal oxides--

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.890
most of the time, you also
get the structure right,

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:03.170
but things get more subtle.

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.990
In transition metal oxides,
the transition metal

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.120
has local d states.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.480
And I showed you before they
often have significant spin

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.640
polarization, so the
first thing you need to do

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.430
is turn spin polarization
on, or you really

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.020
get the wrong answer.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.980
But it often gets worse.

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:24.090
Remember that your spin is a
scalar, so it's up or down.

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:26.780
So now you have a
spatial degree of freedom

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.510
of how to organize
that spin on the ions.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.520
If you have a bunch of
ions, you could put them

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.720
all with the same direction.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.343
That's a ferromagnet,
or you could put them

01:11:36.343 --> 01:11:37.760
with sort of
alternating direction

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.980
as a kind of a anti-ferromagnet.

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.280
And then there's many ways to
make them anti-ferromagnetic.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.200
And unfortunately, in
transition metal oxide,

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.900
it often matters
because there's not only

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.590
a strong spin polarization
effect on the energy,

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.040
but there's a
fairly strong effect

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.940
of the interaction between
spins on different ions.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.260
And I'm showing
you a result here.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.720
This is a simple
crystal structure.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.610
It's a structure of
lithium manganese oxide.

01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:08.450
It's an ordered rock salt.
These are still very simple.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:11.030
But the correct answer--

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.283
I'm showing the comparison
here between two structures

01:12:14.283 --> 01:12:16.200
only labeled by their
symmetry, unfortunately.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.730
One is C2/m, and one is pmmn.

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:23.060
There are similar structures,
but one is orthorhombic,

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.800
and one is monoclinic.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.900
The correct answer is pmmn--

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.610
is the real crystal structure.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.620
If you do a non-spin
polarized calculation--

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.700
so that's not even
allowing spin on the ions--

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.960
you get a whopping error.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.720
I mean, C2/m is lower in energy
by 250 mill-electron volt

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.280
per formal unit.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.240
That's very large.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.020
In kilojoules, that'd be
25 kilojoules per mole.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.420
It's a very large error.

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.890
If you turn on
spin polarization,

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:53.098
will make them ferromagnetic.

01:12:53.098 --> 01:12:53.930
They're degenerate.

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.060
And if you make them
anti-ferromagnetic,

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.030
this one is the
lowest in energy.

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:04.100
Now here's a very common
mistake that people make.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.350
If you take this material
at room temperature,

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.700
it's paramagnetic.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.160
Some people say, well,
it's paramagnetic,

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.020
so I shouldn't have
any spin polarization--

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.160
there's no net moment.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.910
That is so wrong, because
a paramagnet still

01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:19.200
has a local moment.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.390
The ions still have
a moment on them,

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:24.120
it's just randomly oriented.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.710
So you still need to
represent that moment.

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:30.210
Because it turns out that's the
biggest effect on the energy

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:32.460
is the fact that you
have that local moment.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.560
It's not necessarily
how they're arranged.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.970
You can actually see that here.

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:39.630
How they're arranged makes
you go from this difference

01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:41.100
to this difference.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.810
But turning on the
local moment makes

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.750
you go from this difference
to that difference.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.310
So never fall in that trap.

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:52.090
It's really only non-magnetic
materials or diamagnetic

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:57.770
materials for which you don't
really need spin polarization.

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:01.740
Now why is this
effect so important?

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:06.560
It's really because if
you spin polarize an ion,

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.920
you fill different orbitals.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.470
I mean, I've shown that here
with a bunch of d orbitals.

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:14.840
And this is typically how
they split in most oxides.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.850
Every time an ion
is octahedral--

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:21.140
five d orbitals tend to
split in pairs of 3, 2--

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.100
3 down, 2 up.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.520
In some cases, 2 down, 3 up.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.020
But let's say you
have to put four--

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.490
five electrons in there.

01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:30.830
How many do I have?

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:33.290
I'm missing-- no,
four electrons.

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:34.280
If you put them--

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.390
that's called high spin.

01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:38.120
So all parallel spin,
you put them like this.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.980
If you put them low spin,
you put them like this.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.630
So here we have no moment.

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:47.370
So these two ions have
different chemical properties,

01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:50.580
because the electrons
occupy different orbitals.

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:57.120
These are different d orbitals,
and so this orbital points

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.540
in a different direction,
for example, than this one.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.720
So by spin
polarizing, you create

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.980
essentially a different ion.

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:08.920
It's not really an
issue of magnetism,

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.470
because magnetic effects tend
to be small in materials.

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:14.230
But it's the fact that
you create chemically

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:18.870
a different ion because
you fill different levels.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:21.680
That's really why these
energy differences are so big.

01:15:26.533 --> 01:15:28.700
I sort of want to end with
showing you some reaction

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.620
energies very quickly.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.200
And I'm going to sort make
it systematically harder.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.580
So here's a simple one.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.460
A metal, lithium, BCC,
with another metal,

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.640
aluminum forming a
lithium-aluminum compound.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.480
Here's the experimental reaction
energy, here's the LDA one.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.880
10% off.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.020
That's classic.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.840
Metallic reaction
energies, you're somewhere

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.020
in the range 5% to 15%.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.640
The one I show
here, copper-gold,

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:58.740
is a notable exception
where you're over 50% off.

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.030
But most of them,
it's much simpler.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.150
So in metals, you tend to get
very good reaction energies.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:15.770
I want to show you the
case where things go wrong.

01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:20.330
Where your errors become
bigger is in redox reactions.

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:22.670
And I've shown sort of
here three different ones.

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:23.630
They're all related.

01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:25.670
They're essentially a
reaction between an oxide,

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:29.180
or in this case, a
phosphate with a metal

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.110
to react the two together.

01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:33.530
And if you look at
the reaction energies,

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:34.950
you're not considerably off.

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:37.760
GGA gives you 2.8 electronvolts
for this reaction.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.320
Experiment is 3.5.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.150
This one, which is very
similar, the error is 30%.

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:46.190
You get 3.3 electronvolts.

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:48.260
Experiment is 4.6.

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.880
Why is that?

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.820
Well, it has to do with the
lack of error cancellation.

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.380
If you look in
detail what happens

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.450
to the electronic structure
in these materials,

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.710
these are redox reactions.

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:02.240
So if you do the math on the
valences-- and believe me,

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.220
this ion here is 3 plus.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.780
Phosphorus, 5 plus.

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.760
Oxygen is 2 minus, so
you can do the math.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.200
Iron here is 2 plus,
and lithium is 1 plus.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.408
So what has happened
in this reaction?

01:17:16.408 --> 01:17:18.700
Well, you've taken essentially
an electron from lithium

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:24.910
in it's metallic state, and
put it on the iron 3 plus

01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:27.190
to make iron 2 plus.

01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:29.980
So essentially, you've
transferred an electron

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:35.240
from metallic lithium and
ionized lithium to the iron

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.940
to reduce it from
3 plus to 2 plus.

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.800
But think about
what's that doing?

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.003
That electron in lithium--

01:17:42.003 --> 01:17:43.670
lithium is there in
the alkaline metals.

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:45.210
That's an s electron.

01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:47.840
So that's a wide
delocalized orbital,

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.250
and I think it's metallic--

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.440
and you're transferring it to a
localized d state on the iron.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.900
So that electron is
essentially being transferred

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.750
between extremely
different states,

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.750
and this is what's killing you.

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:05.780
Because you transfer between
such different states,

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.900
you start losing a lot of the
sort of cancellation of errors

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:09.920
that you need.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.650
That's the functional theory.

01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:15.980
And in particular,
the error here

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.960
comes from something
quite particular.

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:28.030
It comes from what we call
the self-interaction error.

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:29.880
So I'm trying to sort
make you understand

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.590
where these errors
come from so that when

01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:35.400
you work on your application,
you get a bit of a feeling for.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.090
If you remember how we
solve all these quantum

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:41.040
mechanical equations,
we reduce them

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.575
to one electronic
equations, where

01:18:43.575 --> 01:18:45.700
you have the kinetic energy,
the nuclear potential.

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.025
And then this
effective potential

01:18:48.025 --> 01:18:49.650
which, remember what
all goes in there.

01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:51.150
The effective the
potential-- that's

01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:53.400
the one that has the
exchange correlation in it,

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:58.350
but it also has the Hartree
field, so the coulombic field

01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:59.790
from all the electrons.

01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:04.500
Well, that field includes
the electron itself.

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.330
That's the sort of
oddity in essence.

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:08.250
When you calculate
the charge density,

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.440
that's the charge density
of all the electrons.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.390
We then calculate
the potential coming

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:16.020
from the charge density, that's
the potential coming from all

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.280
the electrons.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.350
But you operate that now
on a single electron.

01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:24.140
So the electron is
feeling its own potential.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:27.410
Part of the exchange
correlation term

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:31.057
corrects for that,
but not all of it.

01:19:31.057 --> 01:19:32.640
And the problem is
that the correction

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.670
doesn't operate as well on
different forms of the charge

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:36.520
density.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.350
In a metal, you have a small
self-interaction error.

01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:44.430
And the reason is if you
look at a state in a metal,

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:45.840
sort of very delocalized.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.220
So very spread out
charge density.

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:51.360
So if you want to think of
it, the part of the electron

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.630
here doesn't feel much of
the charge density coming--

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:56.850
of the potential coming from
that piece of the charge

01:19:56.850 --> 01:20:00.820
density, because
they're very far away.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:05.080
Whereas if you do a very
localized state, in some sense,

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:08.230
then the potential
from the electron

01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:11.320
is very high where the
electron itself is sitting,

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.090
because it's all very close.

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:16.840
If you put an electron in
a delta function if you--

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.202
if you didn't have an
uncertainty principle,

01:20:19.202 --> 01:20:21.160
and you calculate its
potential, it's basically

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.810
sitting on top of itself then.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:26.620
You'd have an infinite
self-interaction.

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.190
So the more local the state
is, the more self-interaction

01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:31.180
you have.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.980
And the exchange
correlation functional

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:37.000
can't quite correct these
two in the same way.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.760
And remember that the exchange
correlation correction comes

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.420
from homogeneous
charge densities,

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.540
so it tends to correct
the metallic state better

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.400
than the localized state.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.960
And so this is why that redox
reaction I showed you had a big

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.980
error, because we were
transferring from a state that

01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.040
was metallic-- the electron
went from the lithium state--

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.590
to the transition metal state.

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:04.510
And somehow, the
self-interaction error

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:07.270
doesn't cancel.

01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:10.030
And you will see
things like that

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:13.460
whenever you transfer electrons
between quite different states,

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.056
so that's something
to keep in mind.

01:21:17.056 --> 01:21:19.720
I think I'm running out of
time here, so yeah, let me

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.230
stop here.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.830
So I'm summarizing
here because this is

01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:26.900
the stuff I went over before.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.750
In general, you do pretty well.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:33.960
I think if I'd given this
summary 10 years ago,

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.100
I would have been even more
optimistic, because most people

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.460
worked on metals and
semiconductors which

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.640
tend to be fairly
delocalized state,

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.140
so LDA and GGA do quite well.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.310
I think as we dig into
more complicated materials,

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:54.140
we have learned more about
the errors of LDA and GGA.

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.580
But on sort of
classic metals, you

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.130
do pretty well with lattice
constants, reaction energies,

01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:00.860
and cohesive energies.

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:03.500
But now there is a series of
methods under development--

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.230
and if we have some time,
we might sort of just broach

01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:07.040
them--

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.200
to deal better with
the correlation energy,

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.020
with the self-interaction
energy to solve

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.760
these problems of
both energetics

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.090
and also electronic structure--
things such as the band gap.

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:18.050
So I'll end here.

01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:20.450
And remember, on
Tuesday, we have lab.

01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:24.970
So you meet in the lab, and then
Thursday, we'll be back here.

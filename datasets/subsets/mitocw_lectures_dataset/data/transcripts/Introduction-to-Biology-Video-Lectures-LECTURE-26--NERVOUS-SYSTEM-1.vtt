WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning. All right. So,
it was a lot of fun to tell you

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
last time about the work that's
going on here at MIT in genomics.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's, it's just fun. I mean it's
fun to share what's going on and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it's fun that you guys can
understand what's going on already

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with simply one semester of biology,
which I think is really cool.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What I would like to do today is
talk about another exciting area,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one I don't work in, but one that I
know many people are interested in.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I would like to lay the
foundations for neurobiology.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Neurobiology is an
incredibly interesting area.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I confess it's the subject that
got me interested in biology in the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
first place, even though
I don't work on it itself.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And, I mean, who can't be
interested in the brain.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But if you want to take on the
brain, you really have to understand

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
its working components
in some retail detail.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so what we're going to focus
on in this course for the next three

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
lectures is the specific molecular
mechanism by which nerve cells are

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
able to transmit signals down their
length, how they're able to transmit

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
signals from one cell to the next,
and then how they're able to change

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
their properties over time,
that is learn and remember.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So, the fundamental unit of
neurological processing is a nerve

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
cell which goes by the name a neuron.
You have approximately ten to the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
twelfth neurons.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How many bases are
in the human genome?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
About three times
ten to the ninth.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, you have a lot more nerve
cells than bases in the genome.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So, it's unlikely that all of
the wiring diagram is completely

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
specified in the sequence of the
genome simply because we have a lot

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
of them here. That's just a minor
side point. And what does a typical

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
neuron look like? So,
neurons and connections.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So, a
neuron. Well,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
a typical neuron, your ten to the
twelfth neurons makes contacts with

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
other neurons. It
might receive contacts.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It might get contacts from, oh,
ten to the third other neurons.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And sends signals to ten
to the third other neurons.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So, that's a lot of connections if
you figure ten to the third times

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
ten to the twelfth. Ten to
the fifteenth connections in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
this circuit diagram. Here's
sort of a, kind of a picture

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of a nerve
cell --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
-- making connections to another
nerve cell. Making connections to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
maybe a muscle.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh, and what activates this nerve
cell? Well, maybe in your eye we

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
have a
photoreceptor cell.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that photo receptor cell will
synapse upon a first neuron which

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
will synapse on a second neuron
which will synapse on your muscle.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So maybe you'll see something,
send a signal, send a signal,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
activate your muscle to pick it up.
Needless to say, it's pretty much

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
more complicated than that because
it will take more than those two

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
neurons to figure out this is a
piece of chalk and how to coordinate

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that whole motion and all,
but you get the idea. So, let's

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
just take a look at some of
these pieces here. What kinds of

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
receptors might we have? We
might have receptor neurons that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:43.000
receive
light --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
-- called photoreceptors.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And these photoreceptors in your
eye are an extraordinary piece of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
engineering. Do you know how
sensitive a photoreceptor can be?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
What's the absolutely minimum
possible detectable unit of light?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
One photon. It turns out
your photoreceptors can,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
under appropriate circumstances,
detect a single photon. Not in the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
bright right but in dark adapted
conditions, you actually have on

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
photon sensitivity.
Very impressive.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Under appropriate conditions,
mind you. Sound receptors. You've

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
got sound receptors in your
ear and they are beautiful.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We're not going to talk
about them at any length,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but there's little flappy,
these little spiky things going

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
along in your ear and they can
translate vibrational energy coming

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
from your ear,
hurting your eardrum,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
being translated into a vibration
into the fluid in your ear into a

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
physical motion of these little
receptors there into an electrical

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
motion, into an electrical
signal that goes into your ear.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So, all of that, all of
that's pretty impressive

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
stuff. We're not going to
talk about the details of it,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
but I invite some of you who
want to learn more about this,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
particularly MIT students I
think find receptors really quite

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
remarkable kinds of devices.
We're going to focus, though,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
more on this intermediate
step here of a generic neuron.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So, here's my generic neuron.
And the first thing that has to be

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
said is there are no generic neurons.
Neurons are all very specific,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but I'm just going to use a
generic neuron for the moment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And the important features
of a generic neuron here,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
it has these funny little processes
on its cell body that are called

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
dendrites. That's where it's
going to receive signals.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Processes are the name
for things that stick out.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So, these processes
are called dendrites.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Here's our nucleus of our cell.
Here's our cell body. We will

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
label this your cell
body with a nucleus in it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Then we have this very long
process here called an axon.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The axon is the wire here. This
region here is called the axon

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
hillock and it looks like a little
hill. That's what hillock means,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it's a little sort of
hill-like region here.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And it's where all the electrical
signals from the cell body are

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
integrated and a, quote,
decision is made about

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
whether to fire. And the
neuron will then fire a

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
signal down the length of its axon
and then it will get to the end here

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
where we have these terminal
processes that'll be synapsing on

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
other cells here. These
are called nerve terminals.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And each will make connections
either with other dendrites or maybe

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
with a muscle, although
you wouldn't see both of

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
those occurring, so I'm
just drawing this for

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
illustration purposes here.
And it will send a signal. And

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
these points of contact
are called synapses. So,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
nerve or muscle. OK?
So, that's your general

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
picture there. You have
a synapse which transmits.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is an electrical signal. This
is typically a chemical signal.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And, as you might imagine, the
pre-synaptic cell is this guy,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the post-synaptic cell is that
guy. So, I'll say pre-synaptic and

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
post-synaptic. And what
neurobiologists want to do

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is understand how does this all work?
How does the initial signal impinge

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
upon the dendrite from a synapse?
How does that signal get collected

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and integrated into a decision about
whether to fire an action potential

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that runs along the nerve?
And then how does that get

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
transmitted from an electrical
signal back into a chemical signal

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
which then restarts an electrical
signal in the next cell,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
etc., etc., etc? Those are some of
the kinds of questions we want to

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ask. Now, I said generic neuron.
Of course there's really nothing

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
generic about it. Some
neurons are very tiny.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Some neurons are very big. What's
the typical size of an ordinary

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
eukaryotic cell in a liver
cell? Ballpark. Ten microns.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So, a typical eukaryotic
cell might be --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:49.000
-- and ten microns.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But a neuron can be anywhere
from that size, ten microns,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
all the way up to three meters.
Where's the longest neuron known?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Squid giant axon. That's possible,
actually. I'm not sure how big

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
squid, I mean there are these
giant squids and they may qualify.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The longest one that I know of
is in a similar sort of setting.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It's in the giraffe. It's a motor
neuron in the neck of the giraffe

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
which runs three meters, a
single cell. But these monstrous

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
squids that, at least in stories,
glom onto boats might actually get

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
up there. Will somebody
check the squid,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the largest squid on record here?
I might need to revise that. But

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the largest one I know about
definitively is the giraffe that has

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
single neurons three meters long.
Ten foot long single cells. So,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
it's really very impressive
what a cell can do there.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So, I'll put down the giraffe but
we'll check out on the squid there.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Giraffe neck. OK. So, what
are the kinds of questions that

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
we might want to ask? Well,
the kinds of questions we

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
might want to ask about this process,
and I'm not going to be able to

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
answer all of them but I'll get
them up here. So, how do receptors

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
transduce
signals --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
-- from the
outside world?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Light, sounds,
touch, etc.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
That's a good question.
People know a lot about it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
How do electrical signals
propagate along the neuron?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Along
an axon?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
People know a lot about that one,
and that's what we're going to

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
discuss today.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
How do signals transmit
across a synapse?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
We'll talk
about that,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
some today and some next time.
And how do they transmit them to

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
effector cells? So
how do signals transmit

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
specifically to effector
cells like a muscle?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We'll talk
about that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Then how does the
pattern of connections --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
-- give rise to
a computation?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
That's
pretty tricky.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We'll talk just a teeny little
bit about the simplest kind of

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
computation, but the complex
computations of recognizing that

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that's somebody's Volkswagen or that
that's your grandmother or something

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
are still beyond us today. But
we know things in between that.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
How does this pattern of
connections arise during development?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
That's a fascinating question.
And a lot is known about it, but

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
we're not going to talk
about it in this course.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
How does this pattern of connections
get modified by experience?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
That's something that we'll mention
briefly on Friday that a colleague

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of mine who's very knowledgeable
about this is going to give.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And that's learning and memory.
And then how does this all give

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:12.000
rise to consciousness?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we haven't got the first clue.
We have no idea. It's fascinating.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I digress for a second.
A famous biologist, J.B.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
. Haldane in the mid-century,
middle of the 20th century wrote a

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
final exam to be given in the year
2000 or so. And on the final exam

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
he had about 20 odd questions.
And if you go through the exam

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
virtually all of those questions
could indeed be answered by a

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
student in the year 2000,
except for the question that says

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
consciousness arises on
embryonic day 18, example.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And we have no progress toward
that particular question.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
That was one that he completely was
way off in terms of being able to

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
predict that we'd make any progress
on. Maybe he meant it as a joke.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Anyway. So, let's now
dive into the specifics.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, electrical signals in axons.
Here is an axon. We're going to

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
give a very close up view.
Here's the lipid bilayer. I'm just

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
going to take a cross-sectional
view of my axon here.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
That's the lipid bilayer.
It turns out if I stick an

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
electrode into an axon and I
measure the voltage gradient from the

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
outside of the cell to the inside of
the cell, what I'm going to find is

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that the inside of the cell
is negative compared to the

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
outside of the cell. There
is an electrical potential

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
across the plasma membrane of
this axon. This plasma membrane you

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
remember, you know, you
all remember about this.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
This is, what, three nanometers
wide. There's an electrical

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
membrane, electrical potential
across this equal to about

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000
minus 70 millivolts.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Now, come on, minus 70
millivolts is pretty trivial,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
right? You go to the store,
you buy a battery, what has it,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
what's it got like one and
a half volts or something?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
It's minus 70 millivolts like who
cares, right? Except it's minus 70

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
millivolts across three nanometers.
What's the electrical field of minus

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:44.000
70 millivolts across the incredibly
tiny distance of three nanometers?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Well, the electrical field strength
minus 70 millivolts over three

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:03.000
nanometers is about 200,
00 volts per centimeter.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
That's a very impressive number,
200,000 volts per centimeter.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Suppose I could arrange to change
the electrical potential of a cell

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
from minus 70 millivolts inside to,
I don't know, minus 70 millivolts

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
outside. That would be a swing
of 400,000 volts per centimeter.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Do you think that a protein which
had an alpha helix that had a dipole

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
moment on it could feel a change
of 400,000 volts per centimeter?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
You bet. Some alpha helix that had
some dipole moment on it would swing

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
wildly in the presence of a change
of 400,000 volts per centimeter.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
That's the key to how things work
down there is this tiny little minus

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
70 millivolts. It's a
huge potential gradient.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And if we can change that we
can swing the shapes of proteins

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
quite dramatically. OK?
That's the principle.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Now, it turns out that if you take
this electrode and use it to change

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
the electrical gradient, what
you will get is the following

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
bizarre and fascinating behavior.
So, take my axon here, I use this,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and what I do is I start
off, here's zero, at minus 70,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
minus 70, this is the
electrical potential.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:41.000
If I use the electrode to change
this to about minus 50 or so then

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
all by itself, with no
further input on our part,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
the cell wildly shoots up to plus 50
before rapidly coming back down and

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.000
reestablishing itself at minus 70.
So, this depolarization slightly

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
shifting it away from being as polar
as it is, it has a polarity of minus

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
70, if we depolarize it, make
it less polar, make it less

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
negative, all by itself the cell
executes something called an action

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
potential. This action potential
involves rapidly changing to being

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
positive inside the cell instead of
negative and then restoring itself.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And, as you would imagine, this
massive change in the field has

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
a huge effect on proteins in
the membrane. This is called

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
depolarization phase.
Not shockingly this is the

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
repolarization that occurs
there afterwards. So,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
it goes from minus 70 millivolts up
to about plus 50 millivolts there.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
All right. How does this happen?
That's my job to explain right now.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Well, the way this happens,
what kind of a beautiful piece of

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
engineering explains this?
Well, the first thing you need to

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
know is that there are some
concentration gradients set up in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
the cell. So, the
concentration gradients in the

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
cell are as follows.
There are certain ions,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
sodium. Sodium happens to be low
inside the cell and high outside the

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
cell. The concentration of
sodium inside the cell is about 12

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
millimolar. Whereas,
outside the cell is about 145

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
millimolar. By contrast,
potassium ions are high

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000
inside the cell, 139
millimolar. Whereas,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
only four millimolar on the outside
of the cell. Calcium ions also have

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
a gradient across the cell.
They are virtually rare.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
0.1 micro, not milli,
micromolar inside the cell and 2.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
millimolar outside the cell. So
there are very big differences in

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
the concentrations. Let
me try to write these

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
concentration gradients. If
this is the outside and this is

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the inside, sodium has a
concentration gradient higher on the

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
outside than the inside.
Potassium has a concentration

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
gradient that's higher on
the inside than the outside.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Calcium has a concentration gradient
higher on the outside than the

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
inside. This turns out to be
the force that drives this action

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
potential, is that energy has been
stored up in these concentration

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
gradients. A concentration
gradient is a form of energy.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Why is that? Well, if
there was no membrane there,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
what would be the concentration
on the inside and the outside?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The same. There wouldn't be
an inside and outside but,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
you know, so let's imagine.
Suppose I just drilled holes in the

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
membrane. I get in there vrm,
vrm, vrm, drill a lot of holes,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
it will equilibrate and, you know,
because just by diffusion there,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
we'll go to the entropy, you
know, entropy will set in and it

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
will be equal concentrations.
If I want to establish a

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
concentration gradient then,
I have to work against entropy.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
That takes energy here. And
that is a form of energy then.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I had to put work into moving
ions around in order to establish a

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
concentration gradient. Well,
who's in charge of carrying

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
out that work? Who is
it that sets up these

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
concentration gradients in the
cell? Membrane proteins. Certain

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
membrane proteins. In
particular, membrane

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
transporters are involved.
So, we're going to talk about

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
transporters and then we'll
talk about some channels.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:51.000
All right.
The first one.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:04.000
There is an ATP-driven
sodium potassium pump.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Any ideas what an
ATP-driven sodium

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
potassium pump does? It
sets up, how does it set up a

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
concentration gradient? So,
what does it pump? It pumps a

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
sodium. Does it pump
a sodium in or out?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
It pumps a sodium out. It pumps
potassium in. And it does it as an

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
even exchange. Why would
it like to do it as an

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
even exchange, one
sodium for one potassium?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Charge conservation, exactly.
So, there's no electrical work to

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
be done if it swaps them one
for one. And is there work,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
though, to be done? Yes, there
is, because if I'm going to

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
pump sodium out of the cell,
I'm doing it against the

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
concentration gradient. Or
at least once I get going I'm

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
doing it against a
concentration gradient. So,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
energy is needed to move a
sodium out of the cell against its

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
concentration gradient.
Energy is also needed to move a

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
potassium into the cell against
its concentration gradient.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And where do we get the energy?
ATP. So, an ATP is burned in order

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
to do that. This guy
gets called an anti-porter

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
sometimes because it's an
anti-transporter or something like

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
that. OK. The pump then is ATPA as
it uses the energy from an ATP to

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
exchange this. Good.
Next. There is an

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000
ATP-driven calcium
pump or transporter.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:05.000
And, as you might imagine,
what does it do? It transports a

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
calcium ion out of the cell,
and it happens not to do that in

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:21.000
exchange for any other ion.
And it, too, is driven by ATP.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So, we go pump, pump, pump, pump,
pump, pump, pump, pump, keep going.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Will this thing be able
to keep going forever,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
set up arbitrarily large
concentration gradients? Why not?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Well, what is nothing
leaked back in?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Could we, could we keep going?
It gets harder and harder to put

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
stuff out because you're working
up against a bigger and bigger

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
concentration gradient. And
the ATP is only going to give

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
you so much energy.
So, at a certain point,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
the burning of that ATP or however
many ATPs it uses for its specific

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
mechanism won't suffice. So,
there's going to be some natural

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
upper bound to how far it could
go in setting up a gradient because

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
there's a nature amount
of energy it can spend. OK.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It's useful to think about
these gradients as, you know,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
work that you've got to do and
the hill gets steeper and steeper.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
All right. So that could, in
principle, set the electrical

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
gradient, the concentration
change across the cell.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
But there's one other
important component that we have

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
to think about. And that
is something called a

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
resting potassium channel.
So, what is a resting potassium

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:51.000
channel? The resting potassium
channel is a protein that sits in

00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:00.000
the membrane and it's
got a hole in it, a pore.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And that pore here is designed so
that while a sodium can't escape

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
through that pore, and you
can imagine there's some

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
little bit of cleaver molecular
architecture to make the sodium atom

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
not be able to, sodium
ion not be able to get out

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
but a potassium ion be able to get
out, a potassium ion can get out.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
This is a completely open door that
allows potassium ions to escape.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Now, isn't this stupid? We
just spent all this ATP getting

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
potassium in and sodium out, and
here I go opening the door for

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
potassium saying you're free to
leave despite all the work we put

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
into bringing you into the cell.
That makes no sense. All the

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
potassium is just
going to rush out.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Can all the
potassium rush out?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
The concentration gradient goes
which way? It's more inside,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
more potassium inside, less outside,
so the potassium is going to rush

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
out. Yes. Ooh,
electrical gradient.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
If there's an electrical, so
maybe at the beginning there's no

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
electrical gradient,
so potassium rushes out.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
What does it do? It makes it
more positive on the outside.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Now the next potassium
wants to rush out.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It's going to, it's going
down its concentration

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
gradient but it's going up a teeny
weenie little electrical gradient.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Now that gets out there, and
what does it do to the outside?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Makes it more positive. So, the
third potassium makes it even

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
more positive. And as
more and more potassiums

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
rush out, the outside becomes more
positive. And every potassium now

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
has to do work to get up
that electrical gradient.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
But, of course, it's
still got a concentration

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
gradient pushing it out. So,
will they keep going forever?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
No, they're going to balance each
other. There will come a point when

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
the concentration gradient, the
force driving potassium out due

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
to the concentration gradient is
offset by the electrical gradient

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
pushing potassium in,
or keeping potassium in.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So, what happens is potassium
goes out, rushes out,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000
or goes out, leaks out,
potassium leaks out which now sets

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000
up an electrical gradient.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And what happens is the cell
becomes more positive on the outside,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
more negative on the inside, and
an equilibrium potential is reached,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
equilibrium
is reached.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
So, an equilibrium
electrical potential --

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
-- is reached when
the concentration

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
gradient exactly offsets,
when it balances the electrical

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000
gradient.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Any guesses to what that electrical
concentration gradient is?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Minus 70 millivolts. That's where
minus 70 millivolts comes from.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
It comes because that's the
concentration gradient at which

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
potassium going up that
gradient just offsets the, yes?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Well, because,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
oh, it doesn't. The
electrical potential wants to

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
keep it in. The concentration wants
it out. The electrical wants it in.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
That's why we have an equilibrium.
Exactly. It's those two balancing

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
forces. Very good.
So, how much potassium,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
by the way, has to rush out
to set this up? It turns out

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
a trivial amount. It turns
out that about ten to,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
one part in ten to the sixth of all
the potassium ions leaving sets up a

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
gradient of about minus,
of about five millivolts,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
minus five millivolts. One part in
a million of the potassium ions will

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
suffice to set up a concentration
gradient of minus five millivolts.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
So, all I've got to do is
set up about, let's see,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I don't know, less than, I
don't know, maybe about one part

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
in ten to the fifth of all
the potassium ions leaving.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
A tiny contribution
of the concentration.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Changing the concentration by one
part in ten to the fifth will get me

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
minus 50 millivolts already.
So, what's very interesting is

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
teeny amounts of ions set up a very
big electrical gradient and have no

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
real effect on the concentration,
but they have a big effect on the

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
electrical gradient. So, when
I say potassium leaks out,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
it only takes a teeny bit of
potassium to leak out in order to

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
accomplish this. OK, guys.
Now let's get ready to make an

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
action potential.
Here it goes. So,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:45.000
the action
potential mechanism.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
We've set up our resting
potential by transporters,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
by this open channel. Now,
the first thing we have is a

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
new kind of membrane channel.
We have a voltage gated

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:19.000
sodium channel.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Check this out. This guy
here is a channel that's

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:35.000
closed. It's closed. Except,
so at minus 70 millivolts

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:45.000
it's closed. But if I can
transiently depolarize the cell to

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:56.000
minus 50 millivolts it
opens and it admits sodium.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So, when I get to minus 50 it opens.
Now, what will sodium do when that

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
door opens? Let's see.
Electrically what would sodium,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:20.000
what would
sodium do?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
So what, well, how
about concentration?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
From the point of view of
concentration what would sodium,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
oh, what did I just draw
here? Ooh, forget my error.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Electrically what would sodium like
to do? It would like to come in,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
wouldn't it? Because it's negative
inside and sodium is positive.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
But from a concentration
gradient what would it like to do?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Come in also. So what's stopping
it? Nothing. We've got the ion

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
that would like to come in
electrically and would like to come

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
in from the point of
view of concentration.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So what happens? It comes
in. And it comes rushing

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
in. Now, what
happens as it comes

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
rushing in? What will it do
to our electrical potential?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
We went from minus 70, we got
it transiently up to minus 50,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
and as it comes in what does it
do to our electrical gradient?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Brings in positive charge. The
electrical gradient goes towards

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
zero. Does it stop at zero? No,
because now, even as the cell

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
becomes positive in the interior,
sodium still wants to keep coming in

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
because of it's
concentration gradient.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
It now has to do some work against
the electrical gradient that's set

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
up, but it keeps going and going
and going. Does it go on forever?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
No, because eventually it reaches a
point where the electrical gradient,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
positive now inside the cell,
offsets the concentration gradient

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
and it'll stop and it'll reach a
new equilibrium potential which turns

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
out to be at about plus
50. Amazing. Opens the door.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Sodium comes rushing in down its
concentration electrical gradient,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
shifts the electrical gradient
from being negative to positive,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
and eventually it slows itself down
because it's now going against an

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
electrical gradient. But
that's not the end of the story

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
because what there also is,
there are two other interesting

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
functions. One, after a
certain amount of time,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.000
after a very brief
time interval --

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
-- this channel also has
the property that it closes.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000
So now when
it closes,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
what's going to happen? The
pumps will start working again

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
and reestablish our negative 50.
It's going to take too long, though.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I mean it'll happen.
You'd get back to minus 50,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
but it's going to take a long time.
So it's good that the channels,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
that the voltage gated
sodium channel closed,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
but even better nature has
arranged to have a voltage gated

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000
potassium channel.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And what happens to this voltage
gated potassium channel is around

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
plus 30 millivolts it
opens and admits potassium.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Now, instead of having to wait for
the relatively slow ATP-driven pumps,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
what happens when I admit potassium?
Well, if the cell is positive on

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
the inside, negative on the outside,
what happens to our potassium?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Potassium starts coming out because
there's more potassium on the inside

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000
and there's also a favorable
electrical gradient.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So, potassium explosively
starts rushing out and rapidly

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000
reestablishes the resting potential.
All this happening in a millisecond.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
It's very impressive.
So, in something like one

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
millisecond we open up the
potassium channels. Now,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
you have to ask how did it happen
that the channels got open in the

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
first place? How did we get to
minus 50? That's the work of these

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
dendrites. The dendrites
integrating a signal from all the

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
things impacting on it will
get the cell to minus 50,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
but once the cell gets to
minus 50 at its axon hillock,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
bingo, the action potential fires,
the cell zips up to plus 50 in a big

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
rush of sodiums and then zips down
to minus 70 again in a big rush of

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:16.000
potassiums. Yes?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Yup. Remember I said it was only
like one part and ten to the fifth

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
of the ions? It's a trivial actual,
the number of ions necessary to set

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
up these electrical things is such
a tiny fraction of the concentration

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
that through this whole thing
those concentrations don't

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
noticeably change.
That's what's so cool,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
is there are different regimes,
right? And they do change. They

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
change by one part and ten
to the fifth of those numbers.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
It's really cool, isn't it?
We haven't screwed up our

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
concentration gradient? We
moved tiny numbers of ions to

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
accomplish all this. This
is very cleaver engineering.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It's very cleaver engineering. Now,
how do we manage to transmit this

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
signal down a cell? Well,
let's talk about how we

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
propagate. I think
this is really cool.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
This is one of the truly great
mechanisms that was invented.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Transmitting an
action potential.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Suppose I transmit my action.
Suppose I have a neuron here and

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:35.000
over here, at the axon hillock, I
transiently depolarize to minus 50.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Then I fire
and fire.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Well, what happens is this part
of the cell was originally minus,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
minus, minus, plus, plus, plus,
it becomes positive temporarily,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:04.000
right? It
now becomes --

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
-- plus, plus, plus. So,
let's go minus along the

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
whole cell here.
Plus, plus, plus,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.000
plus, plus. Now, some little patch
of membrane at the beginning of the

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
axon has become positive inside,
right? Because whatever local

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000
affect here caused this to flip.
If this becomes positive at this

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
part of the membrane, what
happens to the negative charges

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
over here a little bit further
down the axon? Some of them will be

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
pulled over to the positive.
Ho-ho. Some negative charges get

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
pulled over. Well, what
happens when some of those

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
negative charges get pulled
over to my minus 70 millivolts?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Is it as negative as it was before?
No. It becomes minus 50 millivolts.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Oh. What happens when this
becomes minus 50 millivolts?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Fires an action potential. So,
what happens is, here's my axon,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I fire an action, I have
an action potential here,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
and in the course of that I
pull over some negative charge.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
That, of course, transiently
depolarizes here and

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
causes an action potential to
fire. Then, of course, this becomes

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
positive which pulls over some
negative charge which causes the

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
action potential to fire here,
etc., etc., etc. So, if I can

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
manage to get the thing started
with my dendrites causing a transient

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
depolarization from minus 70 to
minus 50 then the action potential

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
itself will draw over some charge
and start the process at the next

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
patch of membrane, the next
patch of the next membrane,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
the next patch of the next membrane
and the next patch of membrane.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And it gets all the way down to
the end. It's a brilliant mechanism.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
You can calculate, based on the
diffusion coefficient of ions,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
how long it will take to
transmit that signal. And it's OK

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
but not good enough.
I'd like it to go faster.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000
How can I make
it go faster?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
How about put an insulator around
it? It turns out that with one little

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
trick, I can speed this
up dramatically. Oh,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
sorry. Sorry about that. The
trick is suppose I were to wrap

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
some insulator around the axon that
would make this such that it could

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
not, that it was not an
electrical contract outside,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
that it was only an electric
contact with the outside solution

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
here, here, here. Then,
when the action potential

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
fires here, it's going to pull
charges over, not from the tiny

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
little patch of membrane here, but
the charges are going to have to

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
come from here, it turns
out, because that's where

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I'm going to next feel my action
potential. And so what'll happen is

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
that the action potential,
if this stuff is electrically

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
insulated, will only be happening
at this little gaps between the

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
insulation. And I can dramatically
speed up the electrical transmission

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
if I'm willing to
insulate the wire.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Because then there's much
less leakage along the way.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
So, it turns out that there are
special cells that wrap themselves

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
around the axon that
are called Schwann cells.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
The Schwann cell wraps itself
around and around and around and

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
squeezes out all of its cytoplasm
leaving only a lipid bilayer.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Lipid bilayers wrapped around
and around and around make

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
great insulators. This is
called the myelin sheath of

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
a nerve. These myelin sheaths allow
the transmission of this action

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
potential to proceed about a
hundred times faster. Very cleaver.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Now you ask me how do I know this
matters? I mean you can calculate

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
that it should go
about 100 times faster.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
But how would you really know that
it mattered. Try taking them off.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Unfortunately, there is a
disease that takes them off.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Some human patients make autoimmune
reactions against their own myelin.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
It attacks their own myelin
and leads to the demyelination

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
of the nerves. This
disease is called multiple

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis
involves an autoimmune attack on

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
your very own myelin sheaths,
and the effects, the very serious

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
effects that multiple sclerosis can
have on an individual come from the

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000
greatly diminished, hundred-fold
diminished conduction

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
velocity of electrical signals
down motor neurons along these

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
large distances.
So, this is, in fact,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
the basic electrical setup. We
have taken a situation where we

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
don't have electrical wires
at all but have concocted,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
through chemistry, a powerful
way to create signals.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
First, by setting up a resting
potential using pumps and an open

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
potassium channel. Then by
setting up this explosive

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
mechanism where a little
change in voltage which,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
of course, has a huge change in
field, swings open a sodium channel,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
shuts it, swings open a potassium
channel, and then cleverly recruits

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
charges from down the
neuron and sends the signal.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Next time we shall talk about what
happens when the signal gets all the

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
way to the other end and it
has to talk to the next neuron.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Till
next time.

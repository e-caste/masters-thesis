00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.400
PROFESSOR 1: OK, let's
launch right into it.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.580
Jacob and Uri were inspired
by the echo channel

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.850
to try out a simulation of what
I'd put on the board last time

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.480
or on my slides.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.230
So what you're going to
hear is Jacob's message

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.550
going into the echo channel.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.790
Remember, that was something
with a unit sample response

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.480
of the type delta n plus.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.050
And actually, I
think in their case,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.420
now it's 0.999 delta n minus 1,
so it is something like this.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.680
Sorry?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.270
Oh, n minus 4,000, OK.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.000
And so you'll hear the
original message, I think.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.330
You'll hear the message going
through the echo channel.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.480
And then you'll hear
the message cleaned up

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.590
with the receiver filter.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.280
That's just the inverse filter.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.670
And then you'll hear what
noise does to it and two

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.310
flavors of noise, I think.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.920
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.992
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:31.180
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.747
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.330
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.940
This is a test of the
602 deconvolution system.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.100
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.590
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.887
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:51.470
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.458
[BELL DINGING]

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.580
PROFESSOR 2: I'm just going
to increase the delay,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.122
so we can hear the
echo more clearly.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.010
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.840
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.400
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.500
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.427
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:33.510
PROFESSOR 2: So you can
all hear the echo in that.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.030
And the next one will
be it cleaned up--

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.380
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.465
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:49.030
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.400
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.325
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:54.700
PROFESSOR 2: So
this was just one

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.327
in deconvolution, assuming
the channel had no noise.

00:02:58.327 --> 00:03:00.160
The next one is what
happens if there's even

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.520
a small amount of
noise in the channel--

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.870
so little that you couldn't
hear it in the echoed signal.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.340
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.450
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.960
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.330
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.913
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

00:03:19.913 --> 00:03:22.330
PROFESSOR 2: So you can hear
the noise building up because

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.130
of the deconvolver.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.338
If you actually had noise
at a particular frequency,

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.380
you end up with an even--

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.900
ECHO VOICE: This is a test of
the 602 deconvolution system.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.030
If this is a real
deconvolution, you

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.520
are instructed to go
as quickly as possible

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.617
to the frequency domain
to make an assessment

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.200
of the effectiveness
of this approach.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.700
PROFESSOR 2: So one of the
difficulties with deconvolution

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.280
is it can be perfect
if you have no noise.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.080
But even small amounts
of noise can really

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.460
mess up the deconvolution.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.162
It magnifies the
small noise sources.

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:53.120
PROFESSOR 1: OK, great.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.790
Thank you.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.290
Thank you.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.810
And that was a few
lines of MATLAB, right?

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.250
Same thing can be
done in Python.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.625
All right, we continue.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.149
So we're going to talk
today about spectral content

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.450
of signals after having spent
some time on the frequency

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.579
domain--

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.680
the frequency response
of LTI systems.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.840
Let's get this up here.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.480
So we've talked about
frequency response.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.490
You've seen the definition.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.212
If I give you the unit output
response of a system over here,

00:04:46.212 --> 00:04:48.170
you know how to compute
the frequency response.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.378
And then we went through
how you can go the other way

00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:53.470
with the DTFT to
compute the frequency

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.520
response and the inverse DTFT to
compute the time domain signal

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.230
from the frequency response.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.080
And what we said
last time was that

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.977
what you're doing with
a unit sample response,

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:06.560
you could actually
do with any signal.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.610
So you can take
any signal x sub n,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.430
compute from it the DTFT,
the Discrete Time Fourier

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.160
Transform, with
the same formula.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.470
What you get is this object
that can be used then

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.570
to reconstruct the signal--

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.203
again, the same
formula, all right?

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:22.870
So there's just a
change of perspective.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.320
There's nothing different here.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.390
The key observation
now, though, is

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.620
that the formula on the
left, the inverse DTFT,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.910
is actually allowing us to
represent x sub n, the time

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.840
domain signal, as a weighted
combination of exponentials

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.560
of this type.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.157
And the reason
that's important is

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.240
that we know how to deal
with signals of that type

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.430
very easily.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.670
We already know
that if you have e

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.090
to the j omega n going into
a system with frequency

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.410
response--

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.420
h omega, so an LTI system
with that frequency response.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.390
Let me make this a
specific frequency omega 0.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:14.230
What comes out is the frequency
response evaluated at omega 0,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.440
multiplying what went in.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.940
All right?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.990
Nothing more
complicated than that.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.370
So what now if
you had an x sub n

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.730
going in that was a weighted
combination of terms

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.695
of this type?

00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:27.820
And I'm going to take a
weighted combination that's

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.780
actually a continuum.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.820
It's not just a finite
number of terms.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.610
I'm going to actually take
this particular weighted

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.330
combination.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.600
So over some interval
of length 2 pi,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.730
I take a weighted
combination like this.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.410
So this is going over all
frequencies in our interval.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.690
Let's take minus pi to pi.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.480
I might as well write
in minus pi to pi--

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.920
keep it explicit.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.020
You can think of this
as being approximated

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.040
by a sum in the usual fashion.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.780
I'm not going to write this out.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.180
But we know how to
approximate integrals by sums.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.950
What the sum will
have is, for instance,

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.720
a typical term of the
type e to the j omega 0n.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.490
And the weight that multiplies
it will be x omega 0 d omega,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.510
right?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.040
So we think of x omega
0 d omega as being

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.760
the amount of the exponential
at frequency omega 0

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.810
that's in x sub n.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.400
So here is a representation
of how the signal is made up.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.240
So then what would you say
is the output of the system?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.930
If that's the input, and
this is an LTI system,

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.380
what's the output going to be?

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.020
Any ideas?

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.612
Somebody?

00:07:56.612 --> 00:07:57.570
I thought I saw a hand.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.280
No ideas?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:15.210
What if instead of this, I had
a1 e to the j omega 1n plus a2

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.670
e to the j omega 2n going in?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.538
Suppose that had gone in?

00:08:21.538 --> 00:08:22.580
What would be coming out?

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:27.890
Folks, we're just two
weeks from a quiz, here.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.640
Yeah?

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.880
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.630
PROFESSOR 1: So can
you tell me explicitly

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.679
what I would get in this case?

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:41.083
If this was x sub n,
then y of n would be?

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:43.860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.010
PROFESSOR 1: a1h.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.513
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:48.930
PROFESSOR 1: Is
it just omega, or?

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:49.680
STUDENT: It's omega 1.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.847
PROFESSOR 1: Omega 1, right?

00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:54.360
It's the frequency response
evaluated at the frequency

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.030
that you're interested
in, and then

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:03.360
e to the j omega 1n, and then
the response to the other term.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.920
This is what
superposition is about.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.540
So that wasn't so hard.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.910
What if instead,
x sub n is given

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.140
by a continuum of
such exponentials?

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.900
Integrals are essentially
linear combinations,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.210
but taken to the limit, where
it's not just a finite number.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.770
So I'm not asking for
a proof of anything.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.778
I'm asking for your conjecture
as to what the answer might be.

00:09:35.778 --> 00:09:37.320
This is how math is
done, by the way.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.010
You conjecture what the result
might be based on gut instinct,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.970
based on well-educated
intuition.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.720
And then you go back
and construct a proof

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.090
and hide all your tracks.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.918
But engineers like to
work with intuition,

00:09:49.918 --> 00:09:51.210
and often will stick with that.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.710
Yeah?

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.801
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.990
PROFESSOR 1: OK, so what would--

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.130
can you give me the
explicit expression?

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.260
What's your guess?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.150
This is going in.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.600
It's a weighted combination of
exponentials with weights that

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.370
are given by x omega d omega.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.404
So--

00:10:14.404 --> 00:10:22.308
STUDENT: So you would get x
omega d omega [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.010
PROFESSOR 1: Times what?

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.675
I didn't hear the last piece.

00:10:31.675 --> 00:10:33.763
STUDENT: Times [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:35.430
PROFESSOR 1: Where's
the j omega coming?

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.995
What's the j?

00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:38.480
I'm missing-- oh,
e to the j omega?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.400
All right.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.663
So start again.

00:10:43.663 --> 00:10:44.580
Oh, you don't want to?

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.230
STUDENT: No.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.437
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.520
You're on the right track.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.312
You got us started.

00:10:48.312 --> 00:10:50.722
Anybody else?

00:10:50.722 --> 00:10:52.430
I could show it to
you on the next slide,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.430
but that will take all
the fun out of it, right?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.708
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:02.197 --> 00:11:04.280
PROFESSOR 1: OK, it's
probably that I didn't hear.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.434
Can you tell it to me?

00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:10.928
STUDENT: x omega [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:17.070
PROFESSOR 1: X omega times h
omega or e to the j omega n?

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.682
What did you say?

00:11:19.682 --> 00:11:22.032
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:22.032 --> 00:11:23.240
PROFESSOR 1: I'm willing to--

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:31.798
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
omega n times [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:31.798 --> 00:11:34.090
PROFESSOR 1: That's still
the part that went in, right?

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.513
Now it's got to get mapped
by a frequency response.

00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:37.930
STUDENT: Yeah,
that's what I said.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.760
PROFESSOR 1: OK, so
maybe you'd said that,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.990
and I didn't hear it.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.550
But now we've got
to assemble this

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.240
over all possible frequencies.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.550
Well, we have the 1 over 2 pi.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.180
Maybe this was said already,
and I just couldn't hear it.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.910
All we're doing is
we're saying here's

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.250
a weighted combination
of exponentials going in.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.890
The weights are given by
the x omegas or x omega d

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.850
omega, if you want to
think of it that way.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.240
So what comes out
is the combination

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.590
of responses to each of those.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.720
These are the things that go in.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.510
For each frequency, you multiply
by the corresponding value

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.428
of the frequency response and
do that for all the frequencies

00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:19.970
of the input.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.513
So this is just applying
linearity and superposition.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:49.850
So if I compare that with this
expression, which just tells me

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:55.580
how the time domain signal yn
relates to its DTFT, right?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.980
This is just writing
the same thing for y

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.500
that I wrote for x over there.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.270
If you compare the
two, what you discover

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.940
about the DTFT of the output?

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.750
Where's the weighted
combination?

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.390
It's whatever multiplies
e to the j omega

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.730
n in this expression, right?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.180
So it's just going to
be h omega x omega.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.770
So we've done a
complete analysis

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.620
of the input-output
response of the system

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.950
for essentially an
arbitrary input with just

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.470
a simple multiplication.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.470
So look what we've done.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.710
We've taken the input that
we were given, computed

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.220
the DTFT of it, which gives
us the spectral content,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.130
and I'll spend some time
giving you intuition for that.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.460
That's the spectral content
of the input signal.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.160
What we've discovered is
that the spectral content

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.390
of the output is the spectral
content of the input scale

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.430
by the frequency response.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.800
And once you have the spectral
content of the output,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.472
you can reconstruct
the time domain signal.

00:14:06.472 --> 00:14:08.680
So the big difference here
is there's no convolution.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.720
You're just doing
a multiplication.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:22.330
Instead of doing y of n
equals h convolved with xn,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.840
we're just doing
a multiplication.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.620
So once again, you see the
convolution of the time domain

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.470
maps to multiplication
in the frequency domain.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.330
All right, so we'll build
up to the story again.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.830
Let's get some intuition
for spectral content.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.550
And let's take a
particular example.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:55.440
So suppose I have an x of n
that's a one-sided exponential.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.185
You've probably done things
like this in recitation already.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.090
So this is a signal
that starts at time 0

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.160
and then starts at the value
1 and halves it each time.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.650
So it's a discrete
time exponential.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:18.410
And so what's the DTFT?

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.240
Well, you're going
to some from m equals

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.990
minus infinity to infinity.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.630
But actually, this only
exists for positive--

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.730
for non-negative time.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.220
So you're going to
get 0.5 to the n.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.217
Or let's keep it at m.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.296
That's just the definition.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.990
Isn't it the definition?

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.726
I'll just use the definition.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:01.337
So you can now sum an
infinite series here.

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:02.170
And what do you get?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:08.530
You get 1 over 1 minus
0.5e to the minus j omega.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:14.080
This is just summing a geometric
series because each term here

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.730
follows from the previous one by
multiplying by the factor 0.5e

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.270
to the minus j omega.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.240
So it's a geometric
series with that ratio.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.360
And so this is what the
sum works out to be.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.930
So if you wanted to figure
out the spectral content,

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.090
you first compute the DTFT.

00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:41.610
And then the most helpful way
to get a feel for the signal

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.890
is to look at the
magnitude of the DTFT.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.745
And that's what's actually
plotted in this case.

00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:48.120
This is taken from
somewhere that

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.530
used slightly
different notation,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.900
but we'll talk through it.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.650
What happened to the
top of my slide, here?

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.400
OK, it doesn't matter.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.300
What I've plotted here
is the magnitude of x

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.790
and the phase of x.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.060
To get that, you'll actually
have to convert this

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.589
to magnitude in angle form.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:08.859
I'm not doing that for you.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.160
I'm assuming you've had
practice or will get practice

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.839
in recitation.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.450
But the result of
that is a magnitude

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.300
that looks like this and a
phase that looks like this.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.869
The horizontal scale, just
to make the point that this

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.480
is a periodic object, just
like frequency response,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.980
it actually goes from
minus 4 pi to plus 4 pi.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.270
But the interval of interest
is really just minus pi

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.450
to plus pi.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:34.950
All right?

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.325
So it's just that
central portion

00:17:36.325 --> 00:17:40.410
that's of interest-- similarly
here, minus pi to plus pi.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.632
And then it replicates
periodically outside of that.

00:17:42.632 --> 00:17:45.090
So we didn't really need to
show it to you outside of that.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.382
This is just to make the point.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.175
Another thing to observe
is that the magnitude

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:54.610
is an even function
of frequency,

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.170
and the phase is an odd
function of frequency.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.440
So these are elementary
checks that you should make.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.600
If you get an
answer that doesn't

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.387
satisfy those properties,
you've gone wrong somewhere

00:18:04.387 --> 00:18:04.970
along the way.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.230
If you look at the
top plot in this set,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.510
the top plot is exactly
a signal of that type,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.490
except I've chosen
a different number.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.640
Instead of 0.5 to the n times
u of n, it's something else.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.220
But here's a geometric--

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.260
sorry, a discrete time
exponential or geometric

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.590
series.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.210
Now I've just plotted the
DTFT from minus pi to pi

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.900
to show you what the spectral
content of the signal is.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.820
And I'm just plotting
the magnitude.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.020
Ignore these labels.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.820
These are the same
figures you saw earlier

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.660
for little h and big H.
I'm using them again,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.950
except now I'm thinking
of this as a signal,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.600
and this is its DTFT.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.700
This is a signal, x sub n, and
this is its spectral content.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.720
The relationship is exactly what
we had with frequency response.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.240
So where is the spectral
content concentrated?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.180
Is it at low frequencies
or high frequencies

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.840
or intermediate frequencies
for this first example?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.550
Concentrated around
0, so you'd say

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.860
it's concentrated
at low frequencies.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.870
There is content
on all frequencies,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.480
though, so this doesn't dip
down to 0 anywhere else.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.720
You have to assemble a
combination of sinusoids

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.260
at all frequencies to
construct this signal here.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.640
Here is a signal.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.470
I've had to change
the horizontal scale

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.170
because this is a signal that
evolves much more slowly.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.590
Again, I can ask what's
the spectral content of it?

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.150
I get something which has
a peak near 0 frequency.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.100
So it's only got low
frequencies in it

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.530
and has very little
high frequency content.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.090
You can also start to
develop ideas for how fast--

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.560
how high a frequency you
ought to expect to see here.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.980
So for instance, what's
the fastest wiggle

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.190
that you see in this signal?

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.440
About how long does it take to--

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.840
if you were thinking of
underlying sinusoids,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.600
what's the fastest wiggling
you're seeing over here?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.180
Well, to my eye, this kind of
rises and curves within about

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.310
18 or 20 samples, right?

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.850
So this might be a half period
of an underlying sinusoid.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.983
So if I thought of
the period as being--

00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:26.400
these are just
rough calculations.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.040
But it helps you understand
what we mean by spectral content

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.820
and helps you as a way
of checking answers.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.450
But let's see.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:44.490
If I said 18 was approximately
a half period of an underlying

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.480
sinusoid, and I don't see
anything faster than that,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.690
period is 2pi over omega 0.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.800
So I'm saying that's
approximately 18.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.110
So the frequency
that I expect to see,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:04.190
the fastest frequency there,
is 2pi over 18 or pi over 9.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.370
Is that roughly consistent
with what we're seeing there?

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.370
Does the spectral
content drop off?

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.420
Well, here is pi over 4.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.630
Here's pi over 8.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.760
Somewhere on pi over
9, we've run out

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.850
of underlying components.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.920
It's because the
frequency content

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.820
is limited to that range that
the associated signal doesn't

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.200
wiggle any faster than this.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.450
Here's another
example-- a signal

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.990
that actually--
well, in this case,

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.880
it seems to have some fairly
regular periodicity to it,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.710
and then it damps out.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.935
By the way, in all these
cases, I'm assuming--

00:21:44.935 --> 00:21:46.310
actually, in all
these cases, I'm

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.800
assuming the signal's
identically 0 outside--

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.250
outside of what
I've shown you here.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.250
If you take the
DTFT of this, you

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.550
find that the spectral content
is what-- low frequency,

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.978
mid frequency, high frequency?

00:22:01.978 --> 00:22:02.882
STUDENT: Mid?

00:22:02.882 --> 00:22:04.630
PROFESSOR 1: Mid
frequency right?

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.730
Because this is low frequency.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.780
Here is 0.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.340
This is high frequency.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.440
This is just a reflection
on the left side.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.390
So at some
intermediate frequency,

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.630
there's a peak in
the spectral content.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.090
And again, you can go
through the rough calculation

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.150
I just made.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.730
So we see some oscillation here.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.230
Let's see.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.313
Let's estimate the period.

00:22:24.313 --> 00:22:27.070
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:32.110
Let's say it's about a period
of 5 for those oscillations.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:37.800
So 2 pi over omega 0
is approximately 5.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.370
So omega 0 is
approximately 2 over 5 pi.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.660
So we expect to see a spectral
peak somewhere around 0.4 pi.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.100
Here's 0.25 pi.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.960
Here's 0.5 pi.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.910
We're about right.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.240
So make these sorts of checks.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.291
Yeah, question?

00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:01.874
STUDENT: So for that
first calculation

00:23:01.874 --> 00:23:03.362
with the [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:08.102 --> 00:23:09.060
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, sorry.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.630
Yeah, I should have
done twice this, right?

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.790
What I did was estimate--
thanks for catching that.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.920
I estimated at about
18 is the half period.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.920
And so the period
I should have had--

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.830
36 here.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.170
Good.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:27.040
This is all ballpark,
of course, but no reason

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.740
to make it worse
than it has to be.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.130
Vibrating, right?

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.340
And that's not exactly
where it sits down there,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.650
but it's in the right region.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.200
Now here's the part that we've
already seen on the board.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.750
Once you know the spectral
content of the input,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.300
you can assemble-- or you can
think of the time domain signal

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.880
as being made up of
those components.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.980
Correspondingly, that's
what the output is.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.750
And all we're doing
is invoking the fact

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.480
that this is an LTI
system for which we

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.370
know the frequency
response gives us

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.460
the output for
exponential inputs.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.710
And then we compare
that with what

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.100
we expect to be seeing
for the DTFT of y,

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.760
and we make this conclusion.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.330
So this is exactly
what we had earlier.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:35.505
One thing to keep in mind, the
DTFT, the frequency response,

00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:36.420
the DTFT--

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.150
these are all complex
functions of omega in general.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.960
Each of them will have a
magnitude and an angle.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.620
So make sure you understand
why the magnitude of y

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.920
is the product of the
magnitudes of h and x

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.740
and why the angle of y is the
sum of the individual angles,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.240
all right?

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:04.940
It's basically the fact
that for a complex number c,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.950
you can write it as
the magnitude times e

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.610
to the j angle.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.560
So that's really what's
being invoked there.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.000
So really, what the story
is about-- we've done

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.320
a lot of math along the way.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.690
But this is really the story.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.540
And I've only exposed
a little part of it

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.820
for you because I've only
dealt with DT signals.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.490
But the same thing holds
for continuous time signals.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.560
A huge class of
such signals can be

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.920
written as linear
combinations of sinusoids.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.540
And when I say
"linear combination,"

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.890
it could be a combination
of a discrete set, finite

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:46.790
or infinite.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.520
Or it could be a continuous
combination of exponentials

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.730
or sinusoids under an integral
sign, but the idea is the same.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:57.560
If you've done 1803, you've seen
this kind of thing happening,

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.500
at least for periodic signals.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.480
And then the other
piece of what we rely on

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.010
is that LTI systems are very
easy to understand in terms

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.660
of their action on sinusoids.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.000
So once you put these
two pieces together,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
you've got a very powerful
way to analyze LTI systems.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.510
So just to go back to
the kind of example

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.280
I had last time, in,
which you'll be--

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.640
or you're already
dealing with in the lab--

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.920
we're talking about an
audio channel, for instance.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.030
The frequency response, in
this case, is the magnitude.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.650
Some characteristic here--
this is a bit of a cartoon.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:41.650
But let me show you more
typical experimental plots

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:42.640
of frequency response.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.040
This is frequency
response magnitude.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.250
In most of these plots, people
don't show you the phase.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.500
Part of the reason is,
or maybe the major reason

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.870
is, that for audio,
the ear is not

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.632
all that sensitive to phase.

00:26:54.632 --> 00:26:56.590
If we were doing the
analogous thing for video,

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.660
then you'd be very
concerned about phase.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.220
But in audio
characteristics, people

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.530
will typically only
show you the magnitude

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.180
because the phase
distortions aren't

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.600
picked up quite that readily.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.160
So here is three speakers.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.450
If you look on the site there,
you'll see many more tested.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.510
This is the frequency range.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.570
Now, I should make some
comments about that.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.040
We're talking about
doing minus pi to pi.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:34.710
We've been talking about
filters with frequency responses

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.490
that we show from
minus pi to pi.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.020
So for instance, if I
had a band pass filter,

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.350
it would be something with--

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.830
in the ideal case,
something like this, right?

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.450
This is because
we're writing things

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.590
in terms of big omega for
a discrete time filter.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.350
These are actually written--

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.910
the scale here is hertz.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.410
And they're talking
about the action

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.610
on an underlying
continuous time signal.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.140
So you actually need a way to
go from an underlying continuous

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:12.360
time signal that sampled at
a particular sampling rate--

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.075
let's say f of s
samples per second--

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:25.910
to a corresponding omega for
the underlying discrete time

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.530
sequence.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.170
So the question is, how
does fs map to omega?

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.910
And I had a slide last time.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.030
I haven't gone
through it in detail.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.530
Maybe we'll have
you work through it

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.250
on a homework problem.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.020
But this is actually
the mapping.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.880
If you have a
sequence that comes

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.450
from an underlying
continuous time sinusoid

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.420
by sampling at fs
samples per second,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.520
and you're doing all
your calculations

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.470
in the discrete
time domain, if you

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.720
want to think about what
that means for the underlying

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.910
continuous time domain, you
want to map pi to fs over 2.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.560
It's not the omega
that maps to that.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.160
It's the pi.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.020
So for instance,
in the lab, I think

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.350
you're using 48
kilohertz, for instance,

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.860
at least for some part of
it, as a sampling rate.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.880
You get a discrete time
sequence out of that.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.830
You do various
DTFT-type computations--

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.560
spectral content or
frequency response.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.930
Then you plot them on
this kind of a scale.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.090
If you want to think about what
the underlying continuous line

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:41.290
frequency is, well, that's
24 kilohertz in this case,

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.980
and minus 24 kilohertz,
it's at this end.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.520
So when you're
trying to visualize

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.910
what this characteristic is
telling you about what you're

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.470
seeing with a discrete
time sequence,

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.738
that's really the mapping.

00:29:55.738 --> 00:29:57.530
The other thing about
these characteristics

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.650
is that people only plot
the positive frequency part.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.000
So they ignore the
negative frequency because

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.025
of the symmetries there.

00:30:08.025 --> 00:30:10.400
In applications, when they
give you a frequency response,

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.800
they will typically just give
you the positive frequency

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.890
part of that.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.340
All right, so this is
what we're seeing here.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.070
This is the characteristic
of the LTI system

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.190
that you're going to be
sending signals into.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.357
And then you've got to
characterize the signals

00:30:29.357 --> 00:30:30.940
that you're going
to send through it--

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.190
voice or music or whatever.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.840
And this is a figure I
showed you last time.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.350
But basically, you're looking
at the spectral content

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.170
of the signal of interest
and seeing how it matches up

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.030
with the channel that you have.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.970
And if you compare with--

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.670
well, let's actually
look at the previous case

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.280
and get a few landmarks, here.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.770
So let's take the Sony speaker,
for instance, down here.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.470
OK, so it's got a fairly
flat frequency response

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.730
for a range of frequencies.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.570
But you've got to get fairly
high up before you get there.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:11.390
For frequencies lower
than about 100 hertz,

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:15.290
this is not doing a very good
job of propagating the sound.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.790
The frequency
response is measured

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.350
by having a microphone at a
fixed distance from the speaker

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.922
in an anechoic chamber.

00:31:21.922 --> 00:31:23.630
And you can see that
this one is actually

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.047
perhaps the poorest
of the-- it is

00:31:25.047 --> 00:31:28.010
the poorest of the speakers
in that it does it very poorly

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.580
with the low-frequency sound.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.260
So for this particular
one, you would

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.210
hope that the spectral
content of what you're

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.010
trying to send
through the channel

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.970
lives somewhere
in maybe 300 to--

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.030
300 hertz to 10 kilohertz--
if you want to get it across

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.710
the channel--

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.840
from the speaker
with high fidelity.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.413
But if you've got
low-frequency signal

00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:52.580
that you're trying to send,
and you use the speaker,

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.122
well, you're going
to be out of luck.

00:31:54.122 --> 00:31:57.830
It's not going to
propagate it very well.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.960
So thinking in terms
of frequency response

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.960
and spectral content
is really key to making

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.310
sense of a lot of this.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.750
All right, let's get a little
more practice with this.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.190
And I just want to show
you that once you've

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.050
learned how to deal
with frequency response,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.570
there's not new stuff
that you're going to do

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.040
to deal with spectral content.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.470
It's just a change
of perspective.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.130
So let's see.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.370
If I asked you for a signal
that had its frequency

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.122
content uniformly distributed
in some finite range,

00:32:29.122 --> 00:32:31.580
can someone tell me what that
signal is going to look like?

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:39.460
I'm asking you for a
signal whose spectral

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:48.460
content is uniformly in
some range minus omega

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.435
c to plus omega c.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.430
Have you met such
a signal before?

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.975
Anyone?

00:33:07.975 --> 00:33:11.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.171
PROFESSOR 1: Sorry?

00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:14.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.540
PROFESSOR 1: It was the unit--

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.790
we've seen the same kind of
thing with the unit sample

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.910
response to the low
pass filter, right?

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.590
So if this was a
frequency response,

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.540
then the associated
unit sample response

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.350
would be the signal
we're talking about.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:29.880
So remember what
that was called?

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.480
We called it a sinc function--

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.130
sinc function in time.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.160
So if the spectral content
is this in frequency,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.338
then the signal that
you're talking about

00:33:41.338 --> 00:33:42.630
is going to be a sinc function.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.090
Now you can actually
work that out.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.170
You don't have to
take my word for it.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.020
You want flat spectral content
in the range minus omega

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.910
c to plus omega c.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:58.330
So the signal that you're
going to get as a result

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.610
you can extract from
this computation.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.900
And this is exactly the same
function that we saw last time.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.090
So the DTFT does what your
eye may not do very well.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.370
If I had just given
you the signal

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.230
and asked you to take
a guess as to what

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.980
the spectral content
of that is, you're

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.960
not very likely to
have ended up deducing

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.100
that the spectral content
is flat in some range and 0

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.340
outside of that.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.739
So the DTFT is
valuable in actually

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:34.179
doing this analysis for you.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:43.659
So there is a signal that
has flat spectral content.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.389
More examples of
a similar type--

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:48.370
and again, we first
encountered these

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.949
in the context of unit sample
responses and frequency

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:52.580
responses.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.747
But now, I just want to
change perspective and think

00:34:54.747 --> 00:34:59.215
in terms of time domain signals
and their associated DTFTs.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.490
So if we look at
the top one there,

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.920
this is the case we
just saw, except I've

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.900
truncated the sinc function.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.657
And so what I get is not the
perfectly uniform distribution

00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:13.990
of frequencies in some interval.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:15.950
There's a little bit
of a wiggle to it.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.160
But this is essentially
the sinc function

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.570
and its spectral content.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.610
Here's another signal
whose spectral content

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.010
is at high frequencies
and essentially

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.710
0 in the low-frequency range.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.460
What does it look like
in the time domain?

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.220
Well, you can
actually work it out.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.330
And here's what you see-- that
this has actually more wiggle

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.150
to it than the sinc does.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.270
Alternate samples seem to
take opposite signs, at least

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.420
of the dominant ones
over here, reflecting

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.600
the high-frequency
content of that signal.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.660
Here's something
that's intermediate.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.700
This also has the
oscillation in sign,

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.220
but it's not necessarily
in alternate samples.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.390
It's a little bit
more leisurely.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:05.490
Here's something that has low
frequency and high frequency,

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.960
but not intermediate frequency.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.470
So you see a component
that's rapid wiggling,

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.030
but you also see this
lower-frequency content

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.530
in there.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.150
So this is what the
DTFT does for us.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.280
Now there's an issue of
how you compute these,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:56.240
because if you look at
the formula for the DTFT,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.590
you could certainly
do analytical things

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.120
with that expression.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.430
And that's the case that--

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.070
we've treated cases of that
type, where you write down

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.160
an analytical
formula for the DTFT.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.730
And then you do things
with that, like plotting.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:18.170
But if I gave you some
numerical sequence here,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.510
there's certain simplifications.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.200
For one thing, you
really aren't going

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.705
to expect to compute this at a
continuum of values of omega.

00:37:27.705 --> 00:37:29.080
You're not really
going to expect

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:35.440
to construct the values
from minus pi to pi

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.840
at every real number omega
in that interval, right?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.310
That would take you a long time.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.740
So what you're
likely to be doing

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:48.520
is asking for what the DTFT
is at some grid of points.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.650
So you'll form a little grid.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.198
And it's on that grid of
points that you want the DTFT.

00:37:58.198 --> 00:37:59.990
That's the only practical
thing you can do.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.110
You're not going to compute
it at all omega outside

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.400
of toy examples like that.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.150
So if you had a numerical
sequence collected in the lab,

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.170
for instance, this is what
you'd be aiming to do.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.990
What's the other thing that's
likely to be the case if you've

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.180
got a numerical sequence
collected in the lab?

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.310
Any thoughts here?

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.610
It's unlikely that
my summation is

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.470
going to go from minus
infinity to infinity

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.345
because I'd be waiting
a long time to collect

00:38:31.345 --> 00:38:32.470
that signal, right?

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.350
So in practice, what
we're dealing with

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.560
are signals of finite
duration, typically assumed

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.120
to be 0 outside
of that interval,

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.660
though you might have reasons
in some context for assuming

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.888
otherwise.

00:38:44.888 --> 00:38:46.930
We're always going to take
finite length signals.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.870
So the summation will be
over a finite interval.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.050
And we're going to want
to compute the DTFT

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.090
on a finite group of points.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.840
And that makes for
some simplifications.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.630
So let's see here.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.950
You've probably heard
people talk of FFT,

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.690
or the fast Fourier transform.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:10.540
The fast Fourier transform is
not a new kind of transform,

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.530
so the name is a
little bit misleading.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.570
It's a good way of
computing samples of a DTFT.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.970
So you don't have to
learn a new transform.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.270
We're still talking about
this object, the DTFT.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.810
The FFT is an efficient
way of computing

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.170
the DTFT on a grid
of points, given

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.838
a signal of finite duration.

00:39:30.838 --> 00:39:33.130
Now, I've got a lot on this
slide, and I hope all of it

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:33.630
is right.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:38.450
But let me talk you through
the basic idea, here.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:44.600
So we're going to
compute the DTFT

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.810
on a finite grid of points.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.840
So that's the omega k's that
I've shown you over there.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.820
We've only got a
finite duration signal.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.320
Let me say that it exists
only from 0 to p minus 1.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.000
So the signal is 0
outside of that interval.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.350
And therefore, all the other
terms drop out of this.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.660
So there's nothing
new in this formula.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.550
This is just
acknowledging that I only

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.250
want to compute the
DTFT at a grid point,

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.350
and I only have a
finite duration signal.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:18.480
Now the interesting thing
is that if your signal is

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.540
0 outside of this
interval, well,

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.220
that means your
signal is completely

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:35.660
specified if xn is known to be
non-zero only on the interval,

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.370
let's say, 0 to p minus 1.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.470
So that's p values.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:45.210
Then you would hope that just
having p samples of the DTFT

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.820
will allow you to
go the other way.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.800
We know for sure
that if I gave you

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:56.800
the entire DTFT, if I
gave you the entire DTFT,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:07.130
that you could go the
other way, because we

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.560
have this expression.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.010
If I gave you the
entire DTFT, you

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.360
would just plug it into here.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.990
And you'd get the
time domain signal.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.450
What's interesting,
though, as it turns out--

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.040
and you might expect this.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.620
Since your signal takes non-zero
values only at p points,

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.760
you only need p
samples of the DTFT

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.680
to get an exact reconstruction.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.980
And here is the formula.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.550
And the derivation is not hard.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.540
I've omitted it here.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.280
It's the same kind of idea
that we used in the full case.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.930
But you can actually--

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:52.250
using the values of the
DTFT at these grid points,

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.200
you can reconstruct
the signal x sub n.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.900
So with these
simplifications, you actually

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.950
have a simple pair that gets
you through the numerics.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.430
If you followed these formulas
exactly as they're written,

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.310
you'd end up doing work
on the order of p squared,

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.200
because you see each
of these summations

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.467
involves taking p products.

00:42:14.467 --> 00:42:15.800
And then you've got to sum them.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.537
But you've got to do it at
p different frequencies.

00:42:18.537 --> 00:42:20.120
And the same thing
on the other side--

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.290
you've got to do p products,
but you've got to do it p times.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.820
So it's order p
squared computation.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.910
The fast Fourier
transform is actually

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:32.060
a clever way of using
the symmetries associated

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.650
with these exponentials
to group the computations

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:36.650
and make it much faster.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.310
And you can actually
reduce it to order p log p.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.170
So it's a huge simplification.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.960
I've got some illustrative
numbers down there.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.750
So the FFT actually
is a major reason

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.150
for advances in
numerical computations,

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.103
including signal processing
of various kinds--

00:42:56.103 --> 00:42:57.770
the fact that you can
get this reduction

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.708
from p squared to p log p.

00:43:01.708 --> 00:43:03.500
All right, I don't
think I need to say much

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.550
about the grid of points.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:10.880
But let's move on to thinking
about spectral content

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.602
of signals going
through channels.

00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:14.810
All right, so we'll get
closer to signals of the type

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.268
that we're interested
in, which are

00:43:16.268 --> 00:43:20.930
these signals in this
case for on-off keying

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.853
that are signaling 1's
and 0's and that we're

00:43:22.853 --> 00:43:24.770
trying to get across a
channel-- for instance,

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.960
the audio channel.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.590
So this might be a typical
finite length sequence.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.410
This particular case, we had
chosen 7 samples per bit.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.120
That's why the shortest
interval you see

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.240
has 7 non-zero bits, there.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.020
Here's the spectral
content of the signal.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.830
And actually, I've
taken this figure

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.080
from an earlier version
of the course, where

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.520
we talked about the discrete
time Fourier series,

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.710
not the discrete time
Fourier transform.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.770
The discrete time
Fourier series turns out

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:59.090
to be something very
similar to the formulas

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.130
I showed you for the FFT.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:06.380
So the discrete
time Fourier series,

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:11.780
apart from a scale factor,
is essentially a story

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.650
built around this relationship.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.320
And that's developed in
some detail in Section 13.2,

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.330
but we're actually
bypassing about this term

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:23.870
to try and keep
the story simpler.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.240
So when you see
these plots, you'll

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.600
see on a, at magnitude
a of k, that's

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.570
a symbol associated with the
discrete time Fourier series.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:34.940
These are actually
Fourier coefficients

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.810
associated with the periodic
replication of this signal

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:39.702
outside.

00:44:39.702 --> 00:44:41.910
So it's a discrete time
version of the Fourier series

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.910
you may have seen in 1803.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.980
All you have to do when
you see a plot like this

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:50.600
is think of it as a scaled
version of the DTFT samples.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.740
So we're just talking about
samples of the DTFT taken

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.120
at a grid of points.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.030
The scale factor may be
off by a factor of p--

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.070
the length of the signal.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.160
But the shape is entirely
told to you here.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.220
So think of this as
samples of a DTFT.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.800
We're going from
minus pi to plus pi.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.210
What's down at
the bottom here is

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.990
imagining that you've sent
this signal over a channel that

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.110
could absorb the entire
spectral content of the signal.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:26.556
So suppose you had a
channel whose bandwidth--

00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:38.670
suppose I had a low pass
channel whose bandwidth

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.610
has got some cutoff.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:42.540
This is low pass.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.920
Suppose this
bandwidth could absorb

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.880
the entire spectral
content of the signal.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.540
In other words, what I mean
is that all these DTFT numbers

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.550
that are significant
actually fit in under this.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.930
So suppose your channel was
such that it didn't attenuate

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.520
the DTFT coefficients.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.600
So the spectral content
is unmodified when

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.920
it gets through the channel.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.370
And so if you resynthesize
the signal using this formula

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.660
at the receiving end, you'd
get back the same thing again,

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.525
because the channel's not
induced any distortion.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.740
Let me go past this
and actually show you

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:35.160
what happens when you
start to distort the--

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.360
what goes across.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.180
So here, what we're doing in
this succession of experiments

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:43.710
is sending that same
signal through a channel

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.040
with successively
smaller bandwidth.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.800
So in the first case,
everything goes through.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.970
There's no distortion.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.040
You get the same
thing back again.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.200
In this case, the
channel actually

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.510
has a cutoff that
ends up zeroing out

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.500
all spectral content outside
of some frequency range.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.105
So it's a low pass
channel whose bandwidth

00:47:04.105 --> 00:47:06.480
is not enough to take the
spectral content of what you're

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.110
feeding across.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.420
So what do you expect to happen?

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.080
Well, the higher-frequency
components of the signal

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.160
have been zeroed out.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.500
So what should happen?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.410
You expect the signal to be
more rounded because it can't

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.520
make these sharp transitions.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:27.070
It takes high-frequency content
to make sharp transitions.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:31.043
So what happens is you trim the
spectral content by sending it

00:47:31.043 --> 00:47:32.710
through a channel
that's not wide enough

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.500
to contain all of the
signal is that you

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.680
get a more rounded
signal at the other end.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.180
So you sent this.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.950
This is what you're receiving.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.990
This is the distortion
that the channel

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.850
has imposed on your signal.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.760
And you can imagine if you tried
to find a place to sample this,

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.650
you might run into some trouble.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:53.570
If you go even
more extreme, here

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:56.360
is an even narrower channel.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.060
What comes out is even more
rounded than what we had there

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.550
because you've taken away more
high-frequency components.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.830
The signal just can't
wiggle that fast,

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:10.130
so it takes its leisurely time
going through its paces here.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.190
And you can imagine that
you can be thrown off

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.770
when you try and take samples.

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:19.670
This is actually even more
evident on the eye diagram,

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:21.440
here.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.030
So these are eye diagrams--
again, the same kind of thing.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:31.190
As you successively
transmit fewer and fewer--

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.500
let's say less and less of
the high-frequency content

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.100
of the signal, what
gets picked up--

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.200
what gets received is
a more rounded version

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.610
of what was sent in.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.230
And the corresponding
eye diagrams

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.330
that you construct--
well, at a certain point,

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.830
I guess somewhere
around here, you'd

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:48.710
be a little nervous about trying
to find a place to threshold

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:50.720
and decide on what
signal you have.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.100
So this is not a noise issue.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.630
This is a distortion issue.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.300
It's distortion
induced by the channel.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.100
And it can all be
understood in terms

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.040
of what the channel is doing
to the spectral content

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.420
of the input.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.350
I think we'll continue next time
to get more insight into this

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:10.330
and start on the
topic of modulation.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.350
PROFESSOR: So Tuesday, we
developed the largest equation

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.720
that you'll probably
ever use at MIT.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.170
Thursday, we destroyed it down
to a rather manageable size.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.690
And today, we are going
to solve it and actually

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.420
show you guys how to work out
different reactor problems all

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
the way from simple one-group
homogeneous reactors

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.450
to expanding intuitively, not
directly, from the mathematics

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.100
to solve, or to pose and
solve, two-group reactor

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460
problems like the one they
did on the AP 1000 reactor

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.070
where they separate the
neutrons into a fast

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.570
and a thermal group.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.970
And I wanted to put
up where we left off.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.150
We have some equation describing
fission, n, n reactions, photo

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.810
fission, absorption,
and leakage or diffusion

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.080
as the big balance equation
for how many neutrons are there

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.070
in some reactor.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.480
And I think last time, I
had some example reactors

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.250
up on the board ranging
from an infinite slab

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.520
with a thickness a, to a
cylinder with-- we'll call it

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.220
a thickness a and a height z.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.990
And the question that we
want to be able to answer

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.170
is, if we draw a graph of flux
versus x through this reactor,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.483
and in this case,
it would be r and z,

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:50.900
what do these
functions look like?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.155
What is the form of this flux?

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:54.530
And so today, from
this equation,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.000
we're actually
going to solve it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.810
So bear with me.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.583
There'll be maybe 20 minutes
of remaining derivation,

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.500
and then I'm going to
teach you how to use it.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.140
So today's class
is going to be more

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.807
like a recitation of
how do you actually

00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:07.880
use this equation
instead of getting to it.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.560
First of all, I want
to simplify things,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.685
which is going to make it--

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.065
de-escalate.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.390
If we simplify things and don't
worry about these NIN reactions

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.690
and photo fission, we have the
equation that you'll actually

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.740
see in your reading.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.570
I'm going to drop them for now--

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.020
and I realize I'm missing
one little gamma--

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.460
because they're
just extra terms.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.610
They were instructive in writing
the neutron transport equation

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.200
because all the
terms looked similar,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.520
but now they're just kind of
extra things for us to write.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.880
And the last thing that
isn't in units of flux

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.630
is this Laplacian operator,
for those who don't remember.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.360
And this Laplacian operator
takes different forms

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.200
in different dimensions and
different coordinate systems.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.930
For 1d Cartesian,
it's pretty easy.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.050
It's just double
derivative, let's say in x.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:22.700
For cylindrical, it's
significantly uglier,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.740
plus d squared over d r squared.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.450
So this is what the
Laplacian operator

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.460
looks like in the case of a
finite cylindrical reactor.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.820
So first we're going to
focus on the infinite slab

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.190
case right here because
it's a lot easier to solve,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.060
analytically.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.560
And then we'll show
you how it would

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.367
go for the cylindrical
reactor which

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:47.700
looks a lot more like the
reactors you'll see everywhere

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.440
else in the world.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.680
So let's start doing a
little bit of rearrangement

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.510
and isolate that Laplacian,
so we can then subtract d del

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.230
squared phi from each side.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.800
OK.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.060
And that cancels those out.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.339
And then we've got something
on the left hand, is

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.250
in del squared phi,
and on the right side

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.990
has all in units of flux.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.150
So then we can divide
everything by the flux.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.500
And if we then cancel
out all the flux

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.210
terms, all two of
them, we're left

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.620
with something awfully simple.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.670
And the last thing we can do
is divide by d on both sides.

00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:49.450
And I'm sorry.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.117
I had to cancel that
flux because that's

00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:52.450
the way that goes.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.080
The d's cancel, and I'll
redraw what we have right here.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.970
So we have minus del
squared flux over flux

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.170
equals constants.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.180
And what are they actually?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.390
It'd be 1 over k times
new sigma fission

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.100
minus sigma absorption over d.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.070
Everyone remember why
we're putting these bars

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.380
on the cross sections
in d and everything?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.603
Can someone just tell me?

00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:29.070
AUDIENCE: Averaged?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.070
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.180
We've averaged overall energy,
so some average cross-section

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.190
would be the average from our
minimum to our maximum energy

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:46.770
of that cross-section as a
function of energy times flux,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.780
over the range itself.

00:05:56.912 --> 00:05:59.370
So by this, we're saying, we're
averaging the cross-section

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.970
somehow over the
whole energy range.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.650
Now, I ask you guys, what sort
of functions in Cartesian space

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.765
happen to have its double
derivative over itself

00:06:11.765 --> 00:06:12.515
equal to constant?

00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:15.976
AUDIENCE: Exponentials.

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:16.967
PROFESSOR: Is what?

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:17.925
AUDIENCE: Exponentials.

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:23.380
PROFESSOR: Exponentials,
or sine and cosine.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.810
You've basically said the
same thing two different ways,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.890
yeah, because the plus and
minus exponentials can be

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.230
rewritten in sines and cosines.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.650
So if we now assume that
our flux solution has

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:46.060
to take the form of, let's call
it a cosine bx plus c cosine,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.680
what's the next constant?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.940
Fx.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.610
I'm sorry, that's a sine.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.610
I don't want to use d
again for obvious reasons,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.790
and e stands for energy.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.380
So that's the next letter
that we haven't really used.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.290
The flux has got to take this
shape or else this condition

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.320
is not satisfied.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.930
So this is the easy way of
solving differential equations,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.010
which is guess the solution
from previous knowledge

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.870
or experience or something.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.800
So based on this, if we
were to draw a flux profile,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.750
let's say, right here was x
equals 0, one of those terms

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.475
has got to go away by
reasons of symmetry.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:24.600
What do you think it'll be?

00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:30.100
Which of those
halves right there

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.800
is symmetric about
the x-axis right here?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.048
Sine or the cosine?

00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:38.390
AUDIENCE: Cosine.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.200
PROFESSOR: Cosine.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.040
Yep.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.930
The sines, it can be inverted
around your coordinate system,

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.990
but it's not symmetric.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.060
It's not a mirror image.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.770
So actually, the
sine term goes away

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.600
and we've got to have
some solution which

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:06.780
looks like a times cosine b of
x because right here our d flux

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.060
dx should equal 0 at x equals 0.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.730
Now, I've intentionally
drawn the flux

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.000
not to go to zero at the
very edge of the reactor.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.680
If the flux automatically
went to zero

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.138
at the edge of the
reactor, there'd

00:08:20.138 --> 00:08:21.590
be no need to shield it, right?

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:27.420
So there are some neutrons
streaming out of this reactor.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.720
And this distance
right here is actually

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.990
equal to two times the
diffusion constant.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.929
Let me get rid of the stuff
we don't need anymore.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.990
This is what we call the
extrapolation length.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.943
And now I should
also mention, I'm not

00:08:52.943 --> 00:08:54.360
going to derive
it because I think

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.027
we've done enough
deriving for one week,

00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:57.480
but I'll just give you the form.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.220
This diffusion
constant can actually

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:09.180
be expressed in terms
of other cross sections

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:18.560
where this mu nought is what's
known as the average scattering

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.190
angle cosine.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.820
And it approximately
equals 2/3 times

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.520
the average atomic
mass of whatever

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.990
it's scattering off of.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.730
So this d that I've
just introduced

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.610
from some physical
analogy actually has

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.820
an expression from cross
sections and the material

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.290
properties that you can look up.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.710
So we've now turned it
into some sort of condition

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.560
where everything can be looked
up in the Janis library,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.260
or whatever cross
section library you have,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.540
plus whatever number
densities you actually

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.420
have in your reactor.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.300
So the picture's starting to
get very real and very physical.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:06.860
So now, if we assume that phi
takes the form of a cosine bx,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.430
let's plug it in.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.420
So if we rewrite
this expression--

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.340
I think I'll need another
color for a substitute--

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.580
so we'll take a cosine
bx and stick it in there

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.690
and stick it in there.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.200
And we'll end up with,
minus del squared cosine

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.850
is going to look like
a times b squared

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:46.490
cosine bx over a cosine
bx equals those constants.

00:10:52.058 --> 00:10:54.180
It's starting to
get very simple.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.290
Keep the bars on there because
they're quite important.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:03.260
And if we cancel things out,
the cosine bx's go away,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.610
the a's go away, and
we're left with whatever

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.970
is inside that cosine.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.470
B squared equals a bunch
of material properties.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.060
There's no information in
here about the geometry

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.590
of our reactor.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.590
There's only the
material properties,

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.920
whereas over here,
this constant b,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.210
I'm going to add a little g to
it which stands for geometry.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.310
And we've now set
up a condition where

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.130
if you know the geometry and
the materials in the reactor,

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.610
you can solve for the final
unknown which is its k

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.020
effective.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.340
How critical or not
is this reactor?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.843
So what would b have to be
to make this cosine valid?

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.530
So what would bg equal if we
have the form of this flux

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.100
like so?

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.310
I'll give you a hint.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:15.710
If the cosine goes to zero
right here at some reactor

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.060
length, a over 2, plus some
extrapolation length, 2d,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.740
then how do we make the cosine
equal to zero at this point?

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.970
What does bg have to equal?

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:32.940
AUDIENCE: Pi halves over 2d?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.580
PROFESSOR: Quite close.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:41.970
Bg would have to equal pi over
a over 2 plus 2d, such that

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.880
when you substitute--

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.930
or over 2, right, yeah.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.950
Oh, yeah, OK-- so that when you
substitute x equals a over 2

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:58.335
plus 2d into there, this
cosine evaluates out to zero.

00:12:58.335 --> 00:13:01.360
Does that makes sense?

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.040
Cool.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.230
So now, we have bg.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.940
There's nothing
here but geometry

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.950
plus a little bit of
extrapolation length

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:10.640
right here.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:10.800
Yeah?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.520
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
there be an over 2?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.730
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.370
There should be an
over 2, so that when

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.260
you plug in x equals a over
2 plus 2d, you get pi over 2,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.570
and cosine of pi over 2 is 0.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.500
Yep.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.550
Cool.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.560
So now we have our bg.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.830
So we substitute
that back in there.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.220
Let's just continue to call it
bg since we have it over there.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.520
And we have this much simpler
expression, bg squared equals 1

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:45.500
over k mu sigma fission plus
sigma absorption over d.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.660
Then, where's our
rearranging color?

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.580
We can multiply everything by d.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.720
And let's see.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.280
That should have been a minus.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.277
Copied myself over wrong.

00:14:00.277 --> 00:14:03.940
The d's go away.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.570
You can then add sigma
absorption to each side.

00:14:11.276 --> 00:14:12.940
And then those go away.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:25.350
And then, you can
multiply everything by k,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.440
and those go away.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:35.910
And finally, divide everything
by sigma a plus d bg squared.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.660
And what we're left with is
our criticality condition.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.900
Our k, our criticality,
is pretty simple,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:57.690
nu sigma fission over
absorption plus leakage.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.670
So finally, after all
that derivation, we've

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.890
arrived at some
intuitive result.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.470
Remember we said that k,
the criticality, or the k

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:11.150
effective, is the ratio of
gains to losses of neutrons.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.910
So that's exactly what we have.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.233
The only gain mechanism
right here is by fission,

00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:17.650
and the loss
mechanisms are either

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.500
absorption by the stuff
in the reactor or leakage

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.920
outside of the reactor.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.570
And so this is
actually how you tell

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.060
when the reactor's
in perfect balance,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.660
is if this condition is
satisfied, and if it equals 1,

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.705
then the reactor is critical.

00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:36.330
So now, we can start
to play with this.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.360
And let's say we started
off with a critical reactor

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.920
and all of a sudden, we were
to boost the absorption.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.590
What should happen
to k effective?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.630
If you start observing
more, right, it

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.250
should go sub-critical.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.100
Now, mathematically speaking,
that means this denominator

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.920
gets larger.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.220
So this ratio gets smaller.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.340
And therefore, k effective
has to go down, as well.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.350
Now that's an easy case.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.810
Let's start exploring some
of the more interesting ones.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.450
Let's say you raise the
temperature in the reactor.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.430
Do we necessarily know
what's going to happen next?

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.890
Let's work it out.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.040
So most cross sections, when
you raise the temperature,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.190
will actually go down in
value due to a process called

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.190
Doppler broadening that
you'll learn about in 22.05.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.560
But suffice to say for now
that cross sections tend

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.420
to go down with temperature.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.050
The most important reason why
is because a cross section is

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.920
a number density times a
microscopic cross section,

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.930
and if the temperature goes
up, then the density goes down,

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.670
and the number
density goes down.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.670
And if the number
density goes down,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.500
the macroscopic
cross-section goes down.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.660
The atoms just spread
out from each other.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.490
So regardless of what happens at
the microscopic cross-section,

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.010
which I'll leave to Ben and
Cord to teach you next year,

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.710
we know that the macroscopic
cross-section goes down

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.512
because it gets less dense.

00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:07.970
So let's try and
work out now, what

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.137
would happen to k effective?

00:17:09.137 --> 00:17:13.819
So what will happen to nu
if we raise the temperature?

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.510
Nothing, let's hope.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.760
What happens to sigma fission?

00:17:20.424 --> 00:17:22.500
This goes down a bit.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.125
But what about sigma absorption?

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.380
Sigma absorption is
going to go down.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.690
Does bg change?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.240
Has the geometry of
the reactor changed?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.927
Probably not.

00:17:35.927 --> 00:17:38.010
Might have thermally
expanded by a few nanometers,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.700
but let's just say, it
doesn't change at all.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.950
What about the
diffusion constant?

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.000
Let's work that out.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.520
Sigma total is going to go down.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.750
Sigma scattering is
going to go down.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.750
So probably what's
going to happen

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.220
is, this diffusion
constant is going

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.690
to go up, which means that
if the atoms spread out more,

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.610
neutrons will move
farther, on average.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.387
Hopefully, that makes
intuitive sense,

00:18:02.387 --> 00:18:03.970
because if the
cross-sections go down,

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.660
then a neutron can move farther
before an average interaction.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.280
So the diffusion constant
is probably going to go up.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.530
Which way does k effective go?

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.680
You're correct.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.830
No one said anything because
you can't really say anything.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.200
So it depends on
the relative amounts

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.000
that these increase or decrease.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.820
So depending on what you
choose for your materials,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.580
you can have what's called
positive or negative

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.940
temperature feedback, which
means in some conditions

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.040
or scenarios, what
you want to happen

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.970
is that if the temperature goes
up, k effective should go down,

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.040
but not necessarily so.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.550
Depending on what you use, you
can actually have situations

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.970
where raising the temperature
raises k effective,

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.443
and that is some seriously bad
news and is actually outlawed.

00:18:53.443 --> 00:18:55.610
You can't design a reactor
with positive temperature

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.862
coefficients.

00:18:57.862 --> 00:19:00.070
So this is the first little
taste of reactor feedback

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.102
is, now that we've written
this criticality condition,

00:19:03.102 --> 00:19:04.810
we can start to explore
what happens when

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.120
you start probing the reactor.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.470
So let's say, what happens
if you just add more reactor?

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.400
In this case-- where's my green?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.890
All the way over there--

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:25.690
without changing the
materials, what happens when

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.060
you make the reactor bigger?

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.190
What increases, decreases
or stays the same?

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.970
Let's just work it through.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.920
Does nu change?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.000
Sigma fission?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.500
No.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.250
Sigma absorption?

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.770
D?

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:43.850
How does bg change?

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.480
Bg decreases, and
as you'd expect,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.760
if you add more reactor
to your reactor,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.812
the k effective should increase.

00:19:57.812 --> 00:19:59.270
And so this,
hopefully, is starting

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.250
to follow some
intuitive pattern.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.590
With a given criticality
condition, in some situations,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.760
you can work out, will the
reactor gain or lose power?

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.590
Speaking of, where's the power?

00:20:13.013 --> 00:20:16.930
Where'd it go?

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.513
Yeah?

00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:19.365
AUDIENCE: The kinetic
energy of neutrons?

00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:21.060
PROFESSOR: So yes,
the power comes

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.430
from the kinetic
energy of neutrons,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.970
but where did the power
go in our expression?

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.470
Yeah?

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.158
AUDIENCE: Power's not
dependent on criticality.

00:20:28.158 --> 00:20:29.420
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.770
That's exactly right.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.360
And it follows
directly from the math.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.580
This a got canceled away.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.030
It doesn't matter.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.030
You can actually have what's
called a zero power reactor.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.510
So the power of the
reactor and its criticality

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.340
are not necessarily linked.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.860
You can have a reactor that
is critical while producing

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.340
tons of power.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.210
You can also have a reactor that
is critical while producing--

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.030
I won't say zero, but an
infinitesimally small amount

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:53.792
of power.

00:20:53.792 --> 00:20:55.250
And they actually
have built these.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.590
They're great test
systems for testing

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.900
our knowledge of neutron
physics because you've

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.190
got a reactor that's producing
maybe 10 watts of power.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.080
It's easy to cool by blowing
a fan on it, let's say.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.060
But you can still
measure the neutron flux

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.730
in different places and test
how well your codes are working

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.820
with a much safer configuration
than sticking probes

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.730
into a gigawatt
commercial reactor.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.420
Yep?

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.300
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
steady state reactor,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.100
how are you [INAUDIBLE] if it's
not really at the steady state?

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.203
PROFESSOR: That would push the
reactor out of steady state.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:28.620
Indeed, so on
Tuesday, we're going

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.170
to start covering transience,
and if k effective

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.030
become something other
than one, the reactor

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.950
is no longer in steady state.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.800
It's not in equilibrium because
the gains and the losses

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.120
are not equal to each other.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.640
And at that point, the
power will start to change,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.870
what you guys all saw when you
manipulated the reactor power.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.930
So since you brought it
up, does anybody remember,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.880
if we draw as a
function of time,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.460
let's say the reactor
power was cruising along,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.770
and right at the time is now,
you withdrew a control rod.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.480
What happened when
you guys did that?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.625
Anyone, because you all did it.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:07.690
It went up.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.250
OK.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.028
And then what?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.840
When you stopped withdrawing the
control rod, did it level out?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.525
So everyone, tell
me what happened.

00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:19.770
AUDIENCE: It slowed down.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.100
PROFESSOR: It slowed
down the increase,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.900
but it didn't stop going up.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.220
Kind of freaky.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.650
So this is why I had you guys
do that power ramp because just

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.410
controlling a reactor is not as
simple as, remove the control

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.200
rod, you remove a certain
amount of reactivity

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.770
because there are
time-dependent effects

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:47.210
due to delayed
neutrons, neutrons that

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.150
aren't immediately
released after fission

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.237
that can have a large effect on
how you control your reactor.

00:22:53.237 --> 00:22:55.070
And then if you wanted
to decrease it again,

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.653
let's say you put
the control rod back

00:22:56.653 --> 00:22:59.570
into its original
position, the power

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.730
would not come back to
its original position.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.110
But then, eventually, it
would start to coast down

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.923
and probably go beneath
its original position

00:23:08.923 --> 00:23:11.090
at which point you have to
constantly be controlling

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.250
those control rods
to keep it in what

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.320
I'll call dynamic equilibrium.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.940
You never really hit static
equilibrium unless it's off.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.520
As I went to a seminar a
couple weeks ago and said,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.190
I don't study biological
organisms in static equilibrium

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.470
because that's better
known as a dead organism.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.790
They're not very interesting.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.520
But dynamic equilibrium sure
is, for them and for us.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.590
So with this process of getting
the single-group balance

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.230
equations, I'd like
to generalize this

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.300
to the two-group
balance equations.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.430
And this is something
you can actually use.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.190
In every case,
we're going to say,

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.460
let's put our gains on the
left and put our losses

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:58.340
on the right, if we want to have
this reactor in equilibrium.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.410
And now we'll
separate our equations

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:06.700
into the fast and thermal
regions of neutron energy.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:14.350
So we'll call those f, and
we'll call the thermal ones th.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.370
So using this model of our
neutron diffusion equation,

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.180
what are the gains of neutrons
into the fast spectrum?

00:24:27.664 --> 00:24:29.086
AUDIENCE: Straight from fission.

00:24:29.086 --> 00:24:30.711
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
straight from fission.

00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:32.020
So how do we write that?

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.770
This process that we're
going through now,

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.320
this is where recitation
really begins because this

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.200
is how I want to show you guys
how to approach a problem,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.720
let's say, a one-sentence
statement like, give me

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.490
the flux anywhere in
a two-group reactor.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.770
This is how we go about it.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.150
So how do you equationally put
the neutron gains from fission?

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.063
What terms do we have
up there right now?

00:24:55.063 --> 00:24:56.896
AUDIENCE: Your neutron
multiplication factor

00:24:56.896 --> 00:24:57.854
and your cross section.

00:24:57.854 --> 00:24:59.178
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:24:59.178 --> 00:25:00.106
Yep.

00:25:00.106 --> 00:25:04.240
You'll have your nu, your
neutron multiplication factor.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.790
And now, we're actually going
to split every cross section

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:17.895
into its fast and
thermal energy ranges

00:25:17.895 --> 00:25:20.270
because now we're actually
splitting that energy, like we

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.640
did when I drew that
crazy cross section.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.200
Let's see, we had log of
e versus log of sigma,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.640
and they all follow
roughly that formula.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.350
And we split it and
said, if we want

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.870
to draw an average
cross section,

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.950
it would look
something like this.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.440
And that would be
our sigma thermal

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.800
and this would be
our sigma fast.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.820
So that's what we're doing here.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.790
So now it gets a
little more complicated

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.480
because both fast
and thermal neutrons

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.730
can contribute to fission.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.890
So how do we write this
in terms of equations?

00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:04.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.220
PROFESSOR: We only
want the neutrons

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.970
that are born into the fast
region, the fast gains.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.370
That doesn't mean you don't
have to consider where

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.740
are the thermal neutrons,
because it's mostly

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.590
those thermal neutrons that,
when they get absorbed and make

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.910
fission, create fast neutrons.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:26.090
So what we'd really need
is sigma fission fast

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.390
times our fast
flux because we're

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.090
going to split every variable
into its fast and thermal

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.410
parts, plus--

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.310
let's put a parentheses there--

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:44.080
sigma fission
thermal phi thermal.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.045
So do you guys see
what I've done here?

00:26:46.045 --> 00:26:47.420
We're assuming
that every neutron

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.820
is born in the fast
group, where we're cutting

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.910
this off at around 1 ev.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.830
And we are assuming
that no neutrons

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.710
are born below 1 ev, which
is a very good assumption.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.580
So in this case, both the
fast and the thermal fluxes

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.933
contribute to creating
fast neutrons.

00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:06.725
Is there any other
source of fast neutrons?

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.230
Good, because I don't
know of one either.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.690
OK what about losses?

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.860
By what mechanisms can
neutrons leave the fast group?

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.360
Yeah?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.332
AUDIENCE: Aren't they absorbed?

00:27:23.332 --> 00:27:24.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.980
They can be absorbed.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.085
So how do I write that?

00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:30.390
AUDIENCE: Sigma af--

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.030
PROFESSOR: af--

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.158
AUDIENCE: --times the flux fast.

00:27:33.158 --> 00:27:34.450
PROFESSOR: Times the fast flux.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.990
So only neutrons in
the fast flux group

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.670
will leave the fast flux
group by absorption.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.270
And what's the other mechanism
that we had in our neutron

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.260
diffusion equation?

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.280
AUDIENCE: Scattering.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
actually, so that's

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.030
not in the diffusion
equation, but you are right.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.670
That's the missing piece that is
going to be the hard part, so.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.047
Let's add that in now.

00:27:55.047 --> 00:27:56.630
So there's going to
be some scattering

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:03.500
from the fast to the thermal
group, times our fast flux.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.270
So not every
scattering event will

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.330
cause the neutron to leave the
fast group, but some of them

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.145
will.

00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:10.520
So we have to
figure out, what is

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.010
the proportion of
those neutrons that

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.720
will scatter from the fast
group to the thermal group?

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.420
For the case of hydrogen,
it's pretty easy

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.910
because the probability of
a neutron landing anywhere

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.960
from zero to e, starting
off at energy ei,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:33.160
if we had our scattering
kernel, is a constant.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.940
So that's not too hard.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.060
And then last, what other
way can we lose neutrons

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.719
from the fast group?

00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:44.825
AUDIENCE: Leakage.

00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:45.450
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:45.960
Leakage.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.210
They can leave the
reactor, and we

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:55.770
can write that as a d
fast bg squared flux.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.230
Make sure everything has
bars that needs them.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.730
OK.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.840
Now, using the same
sort of logic, let's--

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.340
Yeah, Luke?

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.340
AUDIENCE: What's the bg?

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.157
How is that different
from [INAUDIBLE]??

00:29:10.157 --> 00:29:10.990
PROFESSOR: It's not.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.220
It's the same.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.800
It is the same bg that describes
the geometry of the reactor.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.250
AUDIENCE: I guess what's
the subscript b of g?

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.784
PROFESSOR: G means geometry.

00:29:20.784 --> 00:29:21.284
Yep.

00:29:25.432 --> 00:29:26.390
And you had a question?

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just in the last
flux, [INAUDIBLE] fast flux.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.833
PROFESSOR: Yes, thank you.

00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:30.710
That is a fast flux.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.693
Yep.

00:29:31.693 --> 00:29:33.860
But it's important to note
that this flux right here

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.450
is not a fast flux.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.860
We'll get back to that soon.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.290
Now, using the
same sort of logic,

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.230
let's write the gains and
losses in the thermal group.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.600
So what is the only
source of neutrons

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.455
into the thermal energy group?

00:29:47.455 --> 00:29:49.830
I want to hear from someone
who hasn't said anything yet.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.074
So Jared, what would you say?

00:29:59.074 --> 00:30:01.407
Either Jared because I haven't
heard from either of you.

00:30:01.407 --> 00:30:02.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.482
PROFESSOR: You did.

00:30:03.482 --> 00:30:04.400
OK, then you.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.510
I'm sorry.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.010
All right.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.490
Yeah, you said the
no power thing.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.173
Thank you.

00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:12.230
AUDIENCE: So could
you, like if something

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.330
is absorbed in
the fast spectrum,

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.680
jump down to the thermal?

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.560
PROFESSOR: Close.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.480
I want to replace one
word in what you said.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.138
If something is blank
in the fast spectrum,

00:30:21.138 --> 00:30:22.680
it goes down to the
thermal spectrum.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.130
AUDIENCE: Scattered.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.213
PROFESSOR: Yes, scattered.

00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:27.420
Every neutron that leaves
the fast group by scattering

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.534
enters the thermal group
also by scattering.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:38.730
And in this case, we want to
have the fast flux appear here

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.160
because the number of neutrons
entering the thermal group

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.755
depends on how many scatter
out of the fast group.

00:30:43.755 --> 00:30:44.380
Yeah, Luke?

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.090
AUDIENCE: Would you ever
scatter up into the fast group?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.050
PROFESSOR: You'll see.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.480
Yes.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.010
Yeah, great.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.810
I just gave something away.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.740
Yes.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.320
You can, but no,
you usually don't.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.138
So we would consider
that once neutrons

00:30:59.138 --> 00:31:01.430
enter the thermal group,
they're at thermal equilibrium

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.590
with the stuff around
them, and up scattering

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.990
is rarely a possibility.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.560
You'll see.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.950
Yeah, quite soon actually.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.160
Don't worry.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.980
Not like quiz you'll
see, but you'll see.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.513
Yeah.

00:31:17.513 --> 00:31:19.180
I've already got some
stuff planned out.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.520
It's going to be a part
of the homework question.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.410
So now what loss
mechanisms do we have?

00:31:26.254 --> 00:31:27.676
AUDIENCE: Leakage.

00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:28.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah, leakage.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:33.610
So we're going to have some
separate thermal diffusion

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.640
coefficient because that
diffusion coefficient depends

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.110
on the cross sections
which depends

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:45.430
on the groups you're in, times
the same geometry, times phi

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.130
thermal.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.020
And what's the only
other mechanism of loss?

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:48.980
AUDIENCE: Absorption.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.048
PROFESSOR: Absorption.

00:31:53.036 --> 00:31:54.680
We've got to clear a.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.964
Why is there no scattering
from the thermal group?

00:32:01.964 --> 00:32:04.820
AUDIENCE: Didn't you say
it was very rare to have it

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.697
scatter up to the fast group?

00:32:06.697 --> 00:32:08.030
PROFESSOR: I'd say even simpler.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.447
Once you're at the
bottom, there's

00:32:09.447 --> 00:32:11.350
no more lower you can go.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.100
So in neutronics, when
you hit the bottom,

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.475
you don't say,
throw me a shovel.

00:32:14.475 --> 00:32:17.510
You say, you're at the
final energy group.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.970
So now, what we'd
like to be able to do

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:25.740
is, last thing we want to
stick in is our k effective,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.380
our criticality,
because in reality,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.520
this is kind of what we want to
know in terms of the geometry

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.900
and the materials
in the reactor.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.370
So if we know what we make it
out of and how big to make it,

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.100
we should be able to get
those in balance such

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.020
that k effective equals 1.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.765
So the only really unknown here
besides the flux unknowns is k.

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.890
And the reason I don't care
about the flux unknowns

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.340
is, they're going
to go away soon.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:51.840
Yeah?

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.370
AUDIENCE: Does the thermal also
have the [INAUDIBLE] over k?

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.440
PROFESSOR: Absolutely,
because the k effective

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.220
is on the bottom of the total
original sources of neutrons.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.350
Just like, let's see.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.180
That was one group.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:06.720
Yeah.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.430
So I'd say right
now, this accounts

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.050
for the production
of all neutrons,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:13.168
and everything else down
the chain is losses.

00:33:13.168 --> 00:33:13.710
Yeah, Monica?

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:19.202
AUDIENCE: Do we assume that
all neutrons [INAUDIBLE]??

00:33:19.202 --> 00:33:20.660
PROFESSOR: We know,
experimentally,

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.690
that they tend to be born
between 1 and 10 mev,

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.978
but since you asked, let's
escalate the problem.

00:33:26.978 --> 00:33:29.270
And then we will de-escalate
very quickly, just to say,

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.010
let's do a thought
experiment, right?

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.950
Let's say some of the
neutrons were born thermal.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.930
What would we have to
add to this expression?

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.930
There's one variable
missing that's not anywhere

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.550
on these boards, but was
there on Thursday and Tuesday.

00:33:46.987 --> 00:33:47.779
AUDIENCE: Spectrum?

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:48.779
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:33:48.779 --> 00:33:50.340
Chi, the birth spectrum.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.760
So if some neutrons
are born thermal,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.720
then we would have to
add a Chi fast here,

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.810
and we would have to add
a Chi thermal to say,

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:07.070
this is the proportion of
neutrons born fast or thermal,

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:11.909
times nu times
sigma fission fast,

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:16.592
phi fast plus sigma fission
thermal, phi thermal.

00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:18.300
And I'm not writing
nice because I'm just

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.795
going to erase it in a second,
but to go with your thought

00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:22.170
experiment, this
is what it would

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.719
look like if some of the
neutrons were born thermal.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:26.645
Perfectly fine thing to model.

00:34:26.645 --> 00:34:28.020
Doesn't happen
much in real life,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.850
but great exam
question for next year.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.614
Thank you.

00:34:31.614 --> 00:34:33.040
AUDIENCE: Next year.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.239
PROFESSOR: Next year.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.281
I'm not going to give you
your own exam question.

00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:37.850
That's just too easy for you.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:42.659
So for now, let's
forget about that stuff

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:47.040
and stick with the most
realistic situation.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.389
Ah, running out of room already.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.889
OK.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.730
That's for next week.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:57.410
So let's forget about that.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.100
What do we do next?

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.270
We have two equations
and three unknowns.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.530
Interesting.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.370
Or do we really?

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.850
Well, for one thing, if we
can get that top equation

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.240
all in terms of one of the
fluxes, either fast or thermal,

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.310
then every term is
in terms of a flux

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.630
and they can all be divided out.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.690
So let's take one
of these equations

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.210
and substitute in so
that we get everything

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.100
in terms of only one flux.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.580
So let's say, the top one,
which has got the k in it,

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.950
has one instance of phi thermal.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.920
So let's isolate phi thermal
in terms of everything else.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.190
So we have that thermal
equation right there.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:43.620
So we have sigma scattering
from fast to thermal times

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:49.670
fast flux equals two things
times phi thermal, which

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:59.060
is d thermal bg squared plus
sigma absorption thermal.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.760
We're actually
not that far away.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.420
So all we do is, we
divide each side--

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.600
where's my simplifying color--

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.400
substitute.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.560
That's not it.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.260
Rearrange.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:32.720
Divide everything by this
stuff, and those cancel out.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.600
And we're left with an
expression for phi thermal

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.300
which we can now plug
into that top equation.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.130
So we're like one step
away from the final answer.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.360
There, everything's
still visible.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.970
And so now we end up
with 1 over k times

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:59.400
nu sigma fission
fast, fast, plus

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:05.720
sigma fission thermal
times this expression,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:13.340
sigma scattering fast
to thermal, phi flux

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.325
over d thermal.

00:37:16.325 --> 00:37:18.700
I don't usually spend this
much of the class with my back

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.810
to you, but this is pretty
mathematically intense,

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.170
so I apologize for that.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:34.550
And equals sigma absorption
fast, fast flux, plus d fast

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.342
bg squared fast flux.

00:37:39.342 --> 00:37:40.050
That's not a bar.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.710
That has one.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:41.610
That has one.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:42.260
That does.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:42.950
That's good.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:43.980
OK.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.940
Now every single term here
is in terms of fast flux.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.960
So we can just cancel them
from every single term here.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.150
And now we're left
with an expression

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:58.470
for k effective that's just in
terms of material properties

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.020
and geometry for the
two-group problem.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.160
We're only one step away.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.240
So if we multiply everything
by k and divide everything

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:13.400
by this stuff, we'll just
have a sigma absorption

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:19.740
plus d fast bg squared.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.820
That would equal k.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.970
And just like that is
the criticality condition

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.760
for a two-energy
group homogeneous

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.780
reactor of any geometry.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.960
All that matters to
define the geometry

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.390
is, what's this bg squared?

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.480
So this case works for
an infinite slab reactor.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.150
It works for an actual
right cylindrical reactor.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.460
You just have to
sell for or look up

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.410
the correct buckling
term, this bg squared,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.290
which I'll tell
you now, we refer

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:58.500
to as buckling or
geometric buckling,

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.575
and you've got the
solution to this.

00:39:00.575 --> 00:39:02.700
Let's just check to see
what we actually have here.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.730
We have nu material
property, material property.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.650
All of those are material
properties except for the bg's.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.710
So this tells you how to
design a reactor, physically,

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.870
and in terms of which
materials to make sure

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.410
that it's critical.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.920
And if we look at what
this looks like here,

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.660
again, it's a ratio of gains
to losses because eventually,

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.150
the losses right here, these are
the losses from the fast group.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.250
These are the losses
from the thermal group.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.160
These are the gains
in the fast group,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.815
noting that some of the
neutrons born in the fast group

00:39:36.815 --> 00:39:38.190
scatter out of
the thermal group,

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.990
but don't leave the reactor.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.930
So again, it turns out to
a gains over losses ratio.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.300
And there you have it.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.860
So I want to stop at 10 of--

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.060
Yeah.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.952
AUDIENCE: Did we drop
the scattering term

00:39:51.952 --> 00:39:54.320
from the fast equation?

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.870
PROFESSOR: It
should be-- did we?

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.340
Yeah.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.580
Let's stick it in right here.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.290
So we'll just also
stick it here.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:17.647
There.

00:40:17.647 --> 00:40:20.230
And that flux goes away because
it was in terms of everything.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.920
Yeah.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.670
There we go.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.477
Thank you.

00:40:24.477 --> 00:40:25.730
OK.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.980
But again, this
represents losses

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.920
on the bottom, gains on the
top, just like any other k

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.200
effective.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.590
So I wanted to stop here
at 10 of, 5 of, and answer

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.150
any and all questions
you guys have

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.300
about going from the
neutron transport equation

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.850
all the way to something that
you could solve, and then

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.380
start to play
around with to say,

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.990
what happens if I
switch isotopes?

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.060
What happens if I
raise the temperature?

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.070
What happens if a chunk
falls off of the reactor

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.820
and it gets smaller?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.320
Yeah.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.743
AUDIENCE: We got the
equation for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:59.743 --> 00:41:00.729
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:02.208
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.300
PROFESSOR: Somewhat.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.930
We can assume that for
considerably long enough times,

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.330
and to a neutron, a long
time could be like seconds,

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:18.740
that the time and the
spatial form of the flux

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.050
are separable which is
something that we'll talk about

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.310
on Tuesday.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.650
But, if you remember, one
of the major assumptions

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.480
we made in the neutron transport
equation was steady state.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.120
We got rid of any
transient effects.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.210
We'll bring them back, now that
we have a way simpler case,

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.750
on Tuesday.

00:41:38.895 --> 00:41:39.395
Yeah, Luke?

00:41:39.395 --> 00:41:43.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
step, the plus scattering--

00:41:43.597 --> 00:41:44.930
PROFESSOR: From fast to thermal.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:51.430
AUDIENCE: Is that also supplied
by the sigma [INAUDIBLE]??

00:41:57.058 --> 00:41:58.350
PROFESSOR: Where is that going?

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.532
AUDIENCE: It must be
in the denominator,

00:42:00.532 --> 00:42:02.720
right, because it was
over on the right side?

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.797
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:42:03.797 --> 00:42:06.130
Oh, yeah, we divided by all
the stuff on the right side,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.240
didn't we?

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:07.840
OK.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.370
So that shouldn't be there.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.240
But it should be there because
we divided by everything

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.020
on the right side.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.850
Let's just check that
really carefully.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:22.560
So it should have been--

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.890
no, that's the thermal one.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:25.730
So we're not
worrying about that.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:26.230
Yep.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.370
So it would just end up here.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.870
Yeah.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.733
Good point.

00:42:30.733 --> 00:42:32.813
Cool.

00:42:32.813 --> 00:42:34.230
Let's talk a little
bit about what

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.105
I'd want you guys to be
able to do with this.

00:42:36.105 --> 00:42:38.890
So what would I want you to
be able to do on the homework

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.290
and on an exam?

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.120
With the neutron
transport equation,

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.190
recite it from memory.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.280
Well, not really.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.370
But if I were to give you the
neutron transport equation,

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:50.857
I'd maybe want you to explain
what some of the terms mean,

00:42:50.857 --> 00:42:52.440
or tell me how you
would get the data,

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.710
or explain one of the
simplification steps

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.080
and justify why you think
it's OK because we actually

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.560
wrote out the justification
for every step on the board.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.220
Or explain, for example, what's
the physical reason that we

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.820
can solve the neutron transport
equation with this diffusion

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.610
approximation?

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.140
And in which regions does
that approximation break down?

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.120
So can anyone tell
me, from yesterday,

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.720
where is the diffusion
equation a bad approximation

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.750
of the flux?

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.250
Yep.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.705
AUDIENCE: Near the
control rods or the fuel.

00:43:24.705 --> 00:43:26.580
PROFESSOR: Near the
control rods or the fuel,

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.850
or anywhere else where cross
sections change all of a sudden

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.540
because diffusion describes
long distance steady state

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.100
solutions across
places, and where

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.890
things change drastically,
diffusion breaks down.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.080
Because we assumed here
that the neutrons behaved

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.230
like an ideal gas or
some chemical species

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.727
with no neutron to
neutron interactions,

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:52.060
because the mean free path
length for those interactions

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.420
is like, what did we say,
10 to the 8th centimeters,

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.440
so a megameter?

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.280
Yeah.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.420
I love using those
sorts of terminologies.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.940
1,000 kilometers
before a neutron

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.560
would hit another neutron.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.510
Or I might ask
you to, let's say,

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.430
reduce the neutron
diffusion equation

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.060
and come up with a simple
criticality condition.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.400
Or let's say, if you were
to make a physical change

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.290
to the reactor,
tell me if you think

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:18.790
it would go more
or less critical,

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:20.590
and what would happen next?

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.870
Or I could give you a
different physical situation,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.990
like the up scattering
scenario, which I will,

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.350
and ask you to pose and
maybe solve these equations,

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:34.820
or at least get forms of
the criticality condition.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.070
I'm not going to ask you to
get tons of flux equations

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.170
because that's all
22.05 is about,

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.110
is doing this sort
of neutron physics.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:46.230
But I want to make sure that you
walk into that class prepared.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.540
Plus we've been kind
of heavy on the--

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.040
you know, this
class, the name of it

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.075
is Intro to Nuclear Engineering
and Ionizing Radiation.

00:44:53.075 --> 00:44:55.200
And so far, we've been
pretty heavy on the ionizing

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.900
radiation and physics.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.650
So this is where the
engineering comes in.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.170
Assuming you have some
material properties,

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.870
you can now pick them
to create a reactor

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.310
in perfect equilibrium.

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:08.460
Yeah, Kristin?

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.327
No?

00:45:10.327 --> 00:45:12.660
So did anyone else have any
questions about the material

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.670
or about what I might
ask you to do with it?

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.520
Yeah.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.103
AUDIENCE: You said
this equation would

00:45:19.103 --> 00:45:22.370
hold for any geometry just
based on [INAUDIBLE] neutrons.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.260
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.260
So all that you
would do differently

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.970
is, right here, when we had
that Laplacian operator,

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:34.450
we took the one-dimensional
case of an infinite reactor

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.430
in finite and one
dimension, which

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:40.330
meant the Laplacian operator
is just double derivative of x.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.820
But you could pose the equation
in cylindrical coordinates

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.640
and say, well, let's say now
you had an infinite cylinder

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.650
reactor, you
wouldn't necessarily

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:51.750
have sines and cosines that
would satisfy this relation.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.570
Anyone happen to
know what you'd have?

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.390
The sines and cosines of
the cylindrical world,

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.530
called Bessel functions.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.910
So these are the sorts of, in
cylindrical geometry equations,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.753
that behave similar
to sines and cosines

00:46:05.753 --> 00:46:07.420
with kind of regular
routes and that you

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.760
can describe in a similar way.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.980
But I'm not going to
get you guys into that.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.230
I'll just say, OK,
there exists solutions

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.230
that you can look up in
the cylindrical case.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:20.270
And I would not make you
derive them by hand because,

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.710
what's the point?

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:23.840
Again I'm not here
to drill your--

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.760
can you do the same math
over and over again?

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.730
I want to make sure that you
can intuitively understand,

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.440
what's a k effective?

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.545
In a sentence, it's
gains over losses.

00:46:32.545 --> 00:46:34.670
What happens when you push
that out of equilibrium?

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.610
Or what physical situations
could push that out

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:41.160
of equilibrium?

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.110
So any other questions
for you guys?

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:43.625
Yeah.

00:46:43.625 --> 00:46:46.400
AUDIENCE: Just curious
on the cylindrical graph

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.073
we have there, what would
the graph in flux look like?

00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:50.740
PROFESSOR: It would
look pretty similar.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.670
In r, it would kind of
come down like that.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.300
It would always be symmetric
about the center for symmetry

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:03.630
arguments, and in z, it
would look kind of like that.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:09.450
And so actually in the end,
the form of flux in r and z

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.420
comes out as the
first Bessel function.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.820
Let's say, that's a times the--

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.320
what would you call it --

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:29.364
times cosine of this distance
is z, so pi is z over--

00:47:29.364 --> 00:47:31.450
I'm going to have
to add a subscript.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:39.370
And there'd be some
constant a in there.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.280
So what you can assume for
multi-dimensional reactors

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.320
is that the dimensions
are separable.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.790
So the r part is solved
separately from the z part.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.380
And that comes right from the
Laplacian operator right here.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:59.620
If you assume that
some flux in r and z

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.180
can be written like the
r part as a function of r

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.930
times the z part
as a function of z,

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.300
then the solution gets a
lot easier to deal with.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.680
But this is not
something I'd ask

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.240
you to do in any coordinates
but Cartesian because those are

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.240
more intuitive, and you'll
get plenty of the other stuff

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.290
later.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.750
AUDIENCE: What's the name
of those functions again?

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.542
PROFESSOR: They're
called Bessel functions.

00:48:31.303 --> 00:48:33.720
So if you want to look up,
there's a little bit about them

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.780
in the reading, but it's one
of the more advanced topics

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.300
that I'm not going to have
you guys responsible for.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.050
Much rather it be you'd
be able to tell me

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.870
what happens if you
compress the reactor

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:46.720
or raise its temperature,
or pull out a control rod,

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.080
or raise the pumping speed
and cool down the water,

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.848
or something like that.

00:48:52.848 --> 00:48:54.890
So there'll be plenty of
those kinds of questions

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.963
on the homework to help
reinforce your intuition,

00:48:57.963 --> 00:49:00.380
as well as some of the noodle
scratches will be developing

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.890
a criticality reaction
or equation for a more

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.170
complex system than the one
I've just shown you here,

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:09.880
but using the same methodology
and the same ideas.

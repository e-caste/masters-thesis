SCOTT HUGHES: So let me
just do a quick recap

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.560
of what we did last time.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.480
So today, we're going
to move into things that

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.730
are a little bit more physics.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.950
Last time we were really
doing some things that

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.890
allows us to establish some
of the critical mathematical

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.150
concepts we need to
study the tensors that

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.750
are going to be used for
physics on a curved manifold.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.210
So one of the things
that we saw is

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.670
that if I wanted to formulate
differential equations

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.510
on a curved manifold, if I just
defined my derivative the most

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.240
naive way you
might think of, you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.940
end up with objects
that are not tensorial.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.608
And so mathematically you
might say, well, that's fine.

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:49.900
It's just not a tensor anymore.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.780
But we really want
tensors for our physics

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.390
because we want to be
working with quantities

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.100
that have frame-independent
geometric meaning to them.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.880
So that notion of a derivative--
if I just do it the naive way--

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.555
isn't the best.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.180
And so I argued that
what we need to do

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.940
is to find some kind of
a transport operation

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.250
in which there is a linear
mapping between things

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.660
like my vector
field or my tensor

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.950
field and the displacement,
which allows me to cancel out

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.380
the bits of the partial
derivative transformation

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.130
laws that are non tensorial.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.690
There's a lot of
freedom to do that.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.480
One of the ways I suggest we do
that is by demanding that when

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.450
I do this, that derivative--
when applied to the metric--

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.390
give me 0.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.480
And if we do that,
we see right away

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.473
that the transport
law that emerges

00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:37.140
gives me the covariant
derivative as one

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.930
of my examples.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.305
Now this shouldn't
be a surprise.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:40.980
We introduced the
covariant derivative

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.340
by thinking about flat
spacetime operations,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.100
but with all my basis
objects being functionals.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.088
And this in some way is sort of
a continuation of that notion.

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:54.630
The other thing which I talked
about is telling you we're not

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.180
going to use a tremendous amount
here except to motivate one

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.080
very important result. And
that is if I define transport

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.750
by basically imagining that
I slide my vectors in order

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.020
to make the comparison-- along
some specified vector field--

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.880
I get what's known as
the Lie derivative.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.610
And so this is an example of
the Lie derivative of a vector.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.790
And you get this form that
looks like a commutator

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.740
between the vector field
you're sliding along

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.930
and the vector field
you are differentiating.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.997
Similar forms--
which are not really

00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:25.830
the form of a commutator--
but similar forms

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.520
can be written down
for general tensors.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
The key thing that
you should be aware of

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.720
is that it's got a similar form
to the covariant derivative,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.100
in that you have
one term-- let's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.520
focus on the top
line for the second--

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.895
you have one term
that looks just

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.740
like the ordinary
vector contracted

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.830
onto a partial
derivative of your field.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.980
And then you have terms which
correct every free index

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.730
of your field--

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.700
one free index if it's
a vector, one free index

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.140
if it's a one form, and
corrections for an end index

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.130
tensor--

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.250
with the sign doing something
opposite to the sign

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.860
that appears in the
covariant derivative.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.228
What's interesting about
this is that so defined,

00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:10.020
the Lie derivative is
only written in terms

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.790
of partial derivatives.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.663
But if you just
imagine-- you promote

00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:16.830
those partial derivatives
to covariant derivatives--

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.110
you find the exact
same result holds

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.762
because all of your Christoffel
symbols-- or connections

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:23.970
as we like to think of them
when we're using parallel

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.737
transport-- all the connective
objects cancel each other out.

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:29.320
And this is nice
because this tells me

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.170
that even though this
object, strictly speaking,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.230
only involves partial
derivatives, what emerges out

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.780
of it is in fact tensorial.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.110
And it's an object that I
can use for a lot of things

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.110
I want to do in physics.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.402
In particular where we're
going to use it the most--

00:03:43.402 --> 00:03:45.360
and I said you're going
to do this on the PSET,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.030
but I was wrong-- you're going
to do something related to one

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.613
of the PSETs--

00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:50.002
but I'm going to actually--
if all goes well--

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.210
derive an important result
involving these symmetries

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.040
in today's lecture.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.540
We can use this to
understand things

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.255
that are related to conserved
quantities in your space time.

00:03:58.255 --> 00:03:59.880
And where this comes
from is that there

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.920
is a definition of an object we
call the Killing vector, which

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.480
is an object where if your
metric is Lie transported

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.620
along some field C, we
call C a Killing vector.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.519
And from the fact that the
covariant derivative the metric

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.769
is 0, you can turn
the equation governing

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.593
the Lie derivative along C into
what I wrote down just there.

00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:25.760
And I should write its name.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.920
There's the result known
as Killing's Equation.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.960
If a vector has a
Killing vector--

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.910
if a metric has a
Killing vector--

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.830
then you know that
your metric is

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.080
independent of some
kind of a parameter that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.790
characterizes that spacetime.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.290
The converse also holds.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.270
If your metric is
independent of something--

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.980
like say the time
coordinate-- you

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.620
know that there is a
Killing vector corresponding

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.230
to that independent thing.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.682
And so you'll often see this
described as a differing

00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:08.140
amorphism of the
spacetime-- if you

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.307
want to dig into some of
the more advanced textbooks

00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:11.170
on the subject.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.110
We'll come back to that in a few
more details hopefully shortly

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.890
before the end of
today's lecture.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.587
So where I concluded
last time, was we

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:19.420
started talking about
these quantities known

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.370
as tensor densities,
which are given

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.760
the less-than-helpful
definition-- quantities

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.730
that are like tensors,
but not quite.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.280
The example I gave of this--
where we were starting--

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.160
was the Levi-Civita symbol.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.180
So let me just write down
again what resulted from that.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.950
So if I have Levi-Civita--
and the tilde here is going

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.680
to reflect the fact that
this is not really a tensor--

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.070
this guy in some
prime coordinates

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.020
is related to this guy in
the unprime coordinates

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.340
via the following--

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:12.160
let's get the primes
in the right place--

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.310
the following mess
of quantities.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.620
So I'm not going to
go through this again.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.630
This is basically a
theorem from linear algebra

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.020
that relates the
determinant of a matrix--

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.660
not metric, but matrix--

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.360
to what you get when you
contract a bunch of matrices

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.092
onto the Levi-Civita symbol.

00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:39.550
And so the key thing to note
is that if this were not here,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.850
this would look just like
a tensor transformation.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.890
But that is there.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.650
So it's not.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.010
And so we call this a
tensor density of weight 1.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.810
So the other one-- which I
hinted at the end of the last

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.530
lecture, but did not
have time to get into--

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.060
is suppose we look
at the metric.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.427
Now, the metric-- no ifs,
ands, or buts about it--

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:09.010
it's a tensor.

00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.870
And it's actually
the first tensor

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.890
we've started talking
about back in our toddler

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.470
years of studying flat
spacetime, which by the way,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.367
was about three weeks ago.

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:30.450
Obviously that's a tensor.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.100
It's a simple
tensor relationship.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.230
Let's take the determinant
of both sides of this.

00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:49.710
You might look at this and go,
why do you want to do that?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.730
Well when I do this,
I'm going to call

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.710
the determinant of the metric
in the primed representation.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.700
Let's call that G prime.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.050
I get 2 powers--

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.200
2 powers of this Jacobian
matrix is determinant.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.190
And I get the determinant in
my original representation.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.080
Now I want to write
this in a way that's

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.747
similar to the way I
wrote it over here.

00:08:19.747 --> 00:08:21.500
Notice I have all
my primed objects

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.880
over here on the left-hand side.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.900
And my factor of this
determinant relates--

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.360
it's got primed indices in the
upstairs position, unprimed

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.830
in the downstairs.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.850
But the determinant of 1
over a metric is just 1

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.289
over the determinant of--

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.799
the determinant of the
inverse of a matrix is just 1

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.080
over the determinant
of that matrix.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:52.790
And so I can really simply
just say this looks like so.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:09:00.440
So the determinant of the
metric is a tensor density

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.790
of weight minus 2.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.170
What this basically tells us is
I now have two of these things.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.120
I've been arguing basically
this entire course

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.670
that we want to use
tensors because of the fact

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.590
that they give me a
covariant way of encoding

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.110
geometric concepts.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.350
I've got these two things
that are not quite tensors.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.560
I can put them together and
get a tensor out of this.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.440
So what this tells me now is I
can convert any tensor density

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.625
into a proper tensor.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.820
So suppose I have a
tensor density of weight

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:11.160
W. I can convert this
into a proper tensor

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:21.430
by multiplying by a power
of that G. So multiply it

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.940
by G to the W over 2.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.140
One slight subtlety here,
when we work in spacetime--

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.620
let's just stop for a second and
think about special relativity.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:41.020
In special relativity in an
inertial reference frame,

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.410
my metric is minus 1
1 1 1 on the diagonal.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.880
So its determinant
is negative 1.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.610
And when I take negative 1
to some power that involves

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.190
a square root, I get sad.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.480
We all know how to work
with complex numbers.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.330
You might think that's all OK.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.260
It's not in this case.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.370
But the way I can fix that
is that equation's still true

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.353
if I multiply both
sides by minus 1.

00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:08.020
I want this to be a
positive number when

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.978
I take the square root.

00:11:08.978 --> 00:11:13.240
So I'm allowed just to
take the absolute value.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.240
So we take the absolute
value to clear out the fact

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.820
that in spacetime, we tend to
have an indeterminate metric,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.210
where the sign depends
on the interval.

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.670
So remember the only
reason we're doing this--

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.520
this is just a--

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.640
I don't want to
say it's a trick.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.320
But it's not that
far off from a trick.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.810
I'm just combining two
tensor densities in order

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.250
to get a tensor out of it.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.940
And minus a tensor density
is still a tensor density.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.990
So I'm OK to do that.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.907
And I'm just doing this
so that my square root

00:11:52.907 --> 00:11:55.310
doesn't go haywire on me.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.630
So a particular example--

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.960
in fact the one that in my
career has come up the most--

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.550
is making a proper
volume element

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:16.677
converting my Levi-Civita
symbol into a tensor that

00:12:16.677 --> 00:12:17.760
gives me a volume element.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.930
So my Levi-Civita symbol has
a tensor density of weight 1.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.630
If I want to make that
into a proper tensor,

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.010
I multiply by the square root of
the determinant of the metric.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.040
So now I will no
longer have that tilde

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.260
on there, which was meant
to be a signpost that this

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.760
as a quantity is a
little bit goofy.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.570
You wind up with
something like this.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.670
When you go-- and by
the way, sometimes

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.510
when you're working
with this, you

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.370
need to have this thing
with indices in the upstairs

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.150
position.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.260
You have to be a
little bit careful.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.718
But I'll just give
you one example.

00:12:57.718 --> 00:13:02.440
If you raise all four
of the indices, what

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.025
you find when
everything goes through,

00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:06.400
this one is not that hard to
see because you're basically

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.317
playing with a similar
relationship to the one

00:13:08.317 --> 00:13:09.850
that I wrote down over here--

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.008
just a short homework
exercise to demonstrate this.

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:14.800
And then you end up
with the tensor density

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.260
of the opposite sign.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.760
Weight minus 1, you wind up
with a 1 over square root there.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.020
So like I said
one of the reasons

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.030
why this is an important example
is that we use it to form

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.088
covariant volume operators.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.440
So in four-dimensional space--

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:06.860
so imagine here's my basis
direction for spatial direction

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.610
1, spatial direction 2,
spatial direction 3--

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.860
you guys can figure out how
to write spatial direction

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.060
0 on your own time--

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.790
I would define a
covariant 4 volume--

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.430
4 volume element from this.

00:14:34.755 --> 00:14:36.250
It'll look like this.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.080
And if this is an
orthogonal basis,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:52.930
this simply turns
into something like--

00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:57.650
these are meant
to be superscripts

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.265
because these are coordinates.

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:02.480
So it just turns into
something like this

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.210
if I'm working in
an orthogonal basis.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.470
And again for intuition,
I suggest go down

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.685
to 3-dimensional
spherical coordinates.

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:17.810
And I wrote this last time.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.490
But let me just
quickly write it up.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.750
I mean everything I did here,
I tend to-- since this is

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.670
a course on spacetime--

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.250
by default I write
down all my formulas

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.415
for three space dimensions,
one time dimension.

00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:35.180
But it's perfectly good
in 3 spatial dimensions,

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.703
2 spatial dimensions, 17 spatial
dimensions-- whatever crazy

00:15:39.703 --> 00:15:41.870
spacetime your physics want
you to put yourself in--

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.620
or space your physics
wants to put you in.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.620
So I'll just remind you--

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.360
that when you do this,
you've got yourself

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:12.650
a metric across
the diagonal of 1 r

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.690
squared r squared
sine squared theta.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.560
And just to be consistent--

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.572
I usually use Latin letters
for only spatial things.

00:16:24.572 --> 00:16:25.280
So let's do that.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.685
This would be how I would
then write my volume element.

00:16:39.685 --> 00:16:40.560
Did I miss something?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.185
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:41.185 --> 00:16:42.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.340
SCOTT HUGHES: Absolutely.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.720
Yeah.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.767
Thank you.

00:16:46.767 --> 00:16:47.600
I'm writing quickly.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.100
Yeah?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.827
AUDIENCE: Is there [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:52.910
SCOTT HUGHES: This is dx--

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.940
oh, bugger.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.912
Yep.

00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:57.370
I'm trying to get
to something new.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.037
And I'm afraid I'm
rushing a little bit.

00:16:59.037 --> 00:17:01.053
So thank you for catching this.

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.220
And so with this, take the
determiner of this thing.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:09.130
And sure enough you get r
squared sine theta d r d theta

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.170
d phi.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.640
So this is the
main thing that we

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.460
are going to use this result
for-- this thing with tensor

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.480
densities.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.760
I want to go on a
brief aside, which

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.790
is relevant to the
problem that I delayed on

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.890
this week's problem 7.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.370
So there are three
parts of problem 7

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:41.940
that I moved from PSET 3 to PSET
4 because they rely on a result

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.230
that I want to talk about now.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.000
So the main thing that we use
the determinant of the metric

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.880
for in a formal way is
this-- that it's a tensor

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.950
density of weight minus 2.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.750
And so it's a really
useful quantity

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.023
for converting tensor
densities into proper tensors.

00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:00.940
And really the most
common application of this

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.842
tends to be to volume elements.

00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:04.300
But it turns out
that it's actually

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.930
really useful for what a
former professor of mine

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.450
used to like to
call party tricks.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.760
There's some really-- it
offers a really nice shortcut

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.610
to computing certain
Christoffel symbols.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.190
So in honor of Saul Teukolsky
let's call this a party trick.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:36.660
So we're using the
determinant of the metric

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.470
to compute certain Christoffels.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.340
So this is going to
rely on the following.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:55.100
So suppose I calculate
the Christoffel symbol,

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.243
but I'm going to sum
on the raised index.

00:18:58.243 --> 00:19:00.410
And bearing in mind it's
symmetric in the lower one,

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.630
I'm going to do a contraction
of the raised index with one

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.505
of the lower indices.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.630
So let's just throw in
a couple of definitions.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:17.280
This is equivalent
to the following.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.150
And so throwing in the
definition of the Christoffel

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.417
with all the indices in
the downstairs position--

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.470
this formula, by the
way, is something

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.240
that I've been writing down
now for about 27 years.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.830
And I have to look
it up every time.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.447
Usually by the end of a
semester of teaching 8.962,

00:19:54.447 --> 00:19:55.280
I have it memorized.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.660
But it decays by then.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.135
So if you're wondering how
to go from here to here--

00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:00.260
this is the kind of thing--

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.340
just look it up.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.320
So let's pause for a second.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.090
Remember that the metric is--

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.400
it's itself symmetric.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.640
So in keeping with
that, I'm going

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:19.860
to flip the indices on this last
term, which-- hang on a second.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.420
That was stupid.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:21.920
Wait.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.460
Pardon me.

00:20:32.055 --> 00:20:33.930
This is the term I want
to switch indices on.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.693
My apologies.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:38.110
So the reason I
did that is I want

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.610
to have both of
these guys ending

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.312
with the alpha because
notice this and this--

00:20:43.312 --> 00:20:44.020
they're the same.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.490
But I have interchanged
the beta and the mu.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.850
So these two terms--

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.970
the first term and
the third term--

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.970
are anti symmetric upon
exchange of beta and mu.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.690
They are contracted
with the metric,

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.380
which is symmetric upon
exchange of beta and mu.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:02.880
Question?

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.080
AUDIENCE: Does the metric
have to be symmetric?

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.482
SCOTT HUGHES: The metric
has to be symmetric.

00:21:07.482 --> 00:21:16.330
[LAUGHS] I don't want to get
into that right now, but yes

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.620
[LAUGHS].

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.780
So these guys are
anti symmetric.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.080
This guy is symmetric.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.050
And remember the rule.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.720
Whenever you contract some
kind of a symmetric object

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.900
with an anti
symmetric m you get 0.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.050
So that means this
term and this term die.

00:21:47.751 --> 00:21:51.590
And what we are left
with is gamma mu

00:21:51.590 --> 00:22:02.520
mu alpha is 1/2 g u beta, and
the alpha derivative of g u

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.960
beta.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.240
There is the way
it is contracting

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.460
the indices in the 2
metric with the other one.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.918
Well here's a theorem that I'm
going to prove in a second--

00:22:11.918 --> 00:22:16.100
or at least motivate-- that
it's going to rely on a result

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.680
that I will pull
out of thin air,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.320
but can be found in most
linear algebra textbooks.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.820
It's not too hard to show that
this can be further written

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:34.390
as 1 over square root of the
determinant times the partial

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:44.400
derivative of the square
root of the determinant,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.090
which is sometimes-- depending
on your applications--

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.700
this can be written very
nicely as the derivative

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.030
of the logarithm of the
absolute value of the--

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.489
the square root of the absolute
value of the determinant.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.500
So before I go on and
actually demonstrate this,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.770
you can see why this
is actually a pretty--

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.150
so this actually comes up.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.650
I'm going to show
a few applications

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.880
as to why this particular
combination of Christoffel

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.480
symbols shows up more
often than you might guess.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.190
It's really important for
certain important calculations.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.920
And this is telling
me that I can get it

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.380
by just taking one partial
derivative of a scalar

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.900
function.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.916
And if you know your
metric, that's easy.

00:23:27.916 --> 00:23:31.000
So this becomes really
easy thing to calculate.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.750
So let's prove it.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.107
So the proof of this
relies on a few results

00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:45.940
from linear algebra.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.650
So let's not think about
tensors for a second.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.150
And let's just think
about matrices.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.850
So imagine I've
got some matrix m.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.410
I'm going to be agnostic about
the dimensions of this thing.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.040
And suppose I look at
the following variation

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.665
of this matrix.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.340
So suppose I imagine
doing a little variation.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.210
So suppose every element
of m is a function.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:43.390
And I look at a little variation
of the log of the determinant

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.750
of that matrix.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:58.280
Well this can be written
as log is basically

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:06.250
a definition of this.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:13.260
Now, if I exploit
properties of logarithms,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:20.440
this can be written as the
log of the determinant--

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.240
m plus delta m--

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.010
divided by the determinant of m.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.920
Now I'm going to
use the fact that 1

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.317
over the determinant
of m is the determinant

00:25:38.317 --> 00:25:39.150
of the inverse of m.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.700
So taking advantage of that,
I can further write this guy

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:20.000
as something like this.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.495
Now I'm going to invoke
an identity, which

00:26:23.495 --> 00:26:26.120
I believe you can find proven in
many linear algebra textbooks.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.770
It just occurred to me as
I'm thinking about this,

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.620
I don't know if I've ever seen
it explicitly proven myself.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.870
But it's something that's
very easy to demonstrate

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.200
with just a quick calculation.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.463
You can just do--

00:26:36.463 --> 00:26:37.130
I'm a physicist.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.280
So for me I'll use Mathematica.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.060
I'll look at six or
seven examples and go,

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.130
it seems right.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.890
And so I've
definitely done that.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.557
But I believe this
is something that you

00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:46.100
can find proven explicitly--

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.930
like I said-- in most books.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.920
So remember these
are all matrices.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.360
So this isn't the number 1.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360
We want to think of this
as the identity matrix.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.090
Oh and I'm also going
to regard this variation

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.580
as a small quantity.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:15.400
So if I regard epsilon
as a small matrix--

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.290
this can be made formal
by defining something

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.290
like condition number
associated with the matrix

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.080
or something like that.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.480
But generally what
I want to mean

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.220
by that is if I
take this epsilon

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.640
and I add it to 1, all of this--

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.010
so my identity is
1 on the diagonal--

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.380
0s everywhere else--
all the things

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.480
that are put into the
sum of 1 plus epsilon

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.390
are much, much smaller than
that 1 that's on the diagonal.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.260
That will be sufficient.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:46.230
So if epsilon is a small
matrix, then the determinant

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:55.540
of 1 plus epsilon is
approximately equal to 1

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.130
plus the trace of epsilon.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.000
What that approximately
refers to is-- of course

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.180
you can take that further.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.370
And you'll get
additional corrections

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.860
that involve epsilon times
epsilon, epsilon times epsilon,

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.570
times epsilon.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.150
I believe when you do
that, the coefficient is

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.020
no longer universal.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.990
But it depends upon the
dimensions of the matrix.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.000
But leading order it's
independent of dimensions

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.600
of the matrix.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.500
And that's something
that you can

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.460
you can play with a
little bit yourself.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.960
Like I said, this is sufficient
for what we want to do here.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:42.460
So I'm going to think
of my small matrix

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:50.350
as the matrix of inverse
m times a variation of m.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.940
This is our epsilon.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.490
So we're going to apply it to
the line that I have up here.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:04.180
And this tells me that my delta
on the log of the derivative

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:17.690
of m is the log of 1 plus
the trace of m to the minus 1

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.380
on the matrix m.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.130
Log of 1 plus a small
number is that small number.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.440
Now the application.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.900
So this is-- like I said,
this the theorem that you

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.730
can find in books that I don't
know about but truly exist.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.690
This is something I've seen
documented in a lot of places.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:50.115
Let's treat our m as
the metric of spacetime.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.300
So my m will be g alpha beta.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.010
My m inverse will be g
in the upstairs position.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.070
And I will write this
something like so.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.600
And I'm going to
apply this by looking

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.070
at variations in my metric.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.070
So delta log--

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.330
I'm going to throw my
absolute values in here.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:31:00.320
That's perfectly allowed to go
ahead and put that into there.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.350
Applying this to
what I've got, this

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:15.338
is going to be the trace of g
mu beta times the variation of g

00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:16.935
beta gamma.

00:31:16.935 --> 00:31:19.310
And I forgot to say, how do
I take the trace of a matrix?

00:31:33.482 --> 00:31:35.190
So the trace that
we're going to use-- we

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.710
want it to be something
that has geometric meaning

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.240
and has a tensorial
meaning to it.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:48.200
So we're going to call the
trace of this thing g alpha

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.360
beta epsilon alpha beta.

00:31:53.217 --> 00:31:54.800
If you think about
what this is doing,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.380
you're essentially
going to take your--

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.915
let's say I apply this
to the metric itself.

00:31:59.915 --> 00:32:01.790
I put one index in the
upstairs position, one

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.120
the downstairs position,
and then I am summing along

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.390
the diagonal when I do this.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:15.990
You will sometimes see this
written as something like that.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.790
So in this case, when I'm taking
the trace of this guy here,

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.810
that is going to force me to--

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.810
let's see.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.560
So this gives me
a quantity where

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.910
I'm summing over my betas.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.630
And then I'm just going to
sum over the diagonal indices.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.780
I'm forcing my two remaining
indices to be the same.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.880
So putting this
together, this tells me--

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.630
so now what I'm
going to do is say,

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.070
I basically have part of
a partial derivative here.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:18.050
All I need to do is now divide
by a variation in my coordinate

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.010
and take the limit.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.633
So it comes out of this as
the partial derivative--

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.670
looks like this.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.940
Now let's trace it back
to our Christoffel symbol.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.270
My Christoffel
symbol-- the thing

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.100
which I'm trying to
compute-- is one half

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.110
of this right-hand side.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.922
So it's one half of
the left-hand side.

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:20.464
And I can take that one half,
march it through my derivative,

00:34:20.464 --> 00:34:23.300
and use the fact
that 1/2 the log of x

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.830
is the log of the
square root of x.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.260
Check.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:46.860
So like I said, this is
what an old mentor of mine

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.570
used to like to
call a party trick.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.440
It is a really useful party
trick for certain calculations.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.949
So I want to make sure you
saw where that comes from.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.360
This is something you will
now use on the problem

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.087
that I just moved
from PSET 3 to PSET 4.

00:35:00.087 --> 00:35:02.170
It's useful for you to
know where this comes from.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.630
You're certainly not going
to need to go through this

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.130
yourself.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.720
But this is a good
type of calculation

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.440
to be comfortable with.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.960
Those of you who are more
rigorous in your math than me,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.660
you might want to
run off and verify

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.910
a couple of these
identities that I used.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:24.600
But this is very nice
for physics level rigor--

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.730
at least astrophysicists
level rigor.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.070
So let me talk about one
of the places where this

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.550
shows up and is quite useful.

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.000
So a place where I've
seen this show up the most

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.190
is when you're looking at
the spacetime divergence

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.970
of a vector field.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.550
So when you're calculating
the covariant derivative

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.980
of alpha contracting
on the indices--

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.940
let's just throw in--

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.030
expand out the full
definition of things--

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.080
all you've gotta do
is correct one index.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.090
And voila, this is exactly
the things that change--

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.190
where is it-- change my
alpha to a mu-- that's

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.610
exactly what I've got before.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:32.680
And so-- hang on
just one moment.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.440
I know what I'm doing.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.750
These are all dummy indices.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.610
So in order to keep things
from getting crossed,

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.300
I'm going to relabel
these over here.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.340
So I can take advantage of
this identity and write this.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:17.260
So stare at this for a second.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.200
And you'll see that the
whole thing can be rewritten

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.560
in a very simple form.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.660
Ta-da.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.360
You haven't done as much work
with covariant in your lives

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.350
as I have.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.205
So let me just emphasize
that ordinarily when

00:37:56.205 --> 00:37:57.580
you see an expression
like you've

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.950
got up there on the top
line, you look at that,

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.388
and you kind of go [GROANS]
because you look at that,

00:38:02.388 --> 00:38:04.180
and the first thing
that comes to your mind

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.360
is you've got to work out
every one of those Christoffel

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.470
symbols and sum it up
to get those things.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.870
And in a general spacetime,
there will be 40 of them.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.960
And before Odin
gave us Mathematica,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.310
that was a fair amount of labor.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.870
Even with Mathematica it's
not necessarily trivial

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.520
because it's really
easy to screw things up.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.350
With this you calculate the
determinant of the metric,

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.990
you take its square root,
you multiply your guy,

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.330
and you take a partial
derivative, and you divide.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.580
That is something
that most of us

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.410
learned how to do
quite a long time ago.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.892
It cleans the hell
out of this up.

00:38:38.892 --> 00:38:41.350
So the fact that this gives us
something that only involves

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.794
partial derivatives is awesome.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.590
This also-- it turns out-- so
when you have things like this,

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.730
it gives us a nice way to
express Gauss's theorem

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:04.740
in a curved manifold.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.225
So Gauss's theorem-- if I
just look at the integrals

00:39:11.225 --> 00:39:13.600
that-- or rather the integral
for Gauss's theorem-- let's

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.070
put it that way.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.560
Let's say a
Gauss's-type integral.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.520
So go back to when
you're talking

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.750
about conservation laws.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:38.400
If I imagine I'm integrating the
divergence of some vector field

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.130
over a four-dimensional
volume, look at that,

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.820
I get a nice cancellation.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:57.180
So this turns into an integral
of that nice, clean derivative

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.780
over my four coordinates.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.570
And then you can take
advantage of the actual content

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.977
of Gauss's Theorem to
turn that into an integral

00:40:05.977 --> 00:40:08.310
over the three-dimensional
surface that bounds that four

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.810
volume.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.320
It's a good point--

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.825
so you're emboldened by this.

00:40:15.825 --> 00:40:16.950
You say, yay, look at that.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.230
We can do all this awesome
stuff with this identity.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.875
It gives me a great
way to express some

00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:23.400
of these conservation laws.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.767
You might think to yourself--

00:40:24.767 --> 00:40:26.850
and I realized as I was
looking over these notes--

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:30.390
I'm about to I think give away
a part of one of the problems

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.510
on the PSET-- but c'est la vie.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.510
It's an important point.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.432
Can we do something
similar for tensors?

00:40:38.432 --> 00:40:40.640
So this is great that you
have this form for vectors.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.287
The divergence of a vector
is a mathematical notion that

00:40:46.287 --> 00:40:47.495
comes up in various contexts.

00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:49.320
So this is important.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.410
But we've already
talked about the fact

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.150
that things like
energy and momentum

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.670
are described by a
stress energy tensor.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.080
So can we do this for tensors?

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:09.000
Well the answer
turns out to be no,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.245
except in a handful of cases.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:17.260
And I have a comment about
those handful of cases.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.510
So suppose I take this--

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.040
and I'm taking the
divergence on say

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.360
the first index of this guy--

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.540
so there's the bit involves
my partial derivative--

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.450
I'm going to have
a bit that involves

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.640
correcting the first index.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:58.160
So the first correction
is it's of a form that

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.720
does in fact involve
this guy we just

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.963
worked out this identity for.

00:42:00.963 --> 00:42:02.630
And in principle we
could take advantage

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.480
of that to massage this
and use this identity.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.508
But the second one there's
nothing to do with that.

00:42:08.508 --> 00:42:10.050
This you just have
to go and work out

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.840
all of your 40 different
Christoffel symbols

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.310
and sit down and
slog through it.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.935
This spoils your
ability to do anything

00:42:15.935 --> 00:42:21.270
with it, with one exception.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:25.102
What if a is an
anti-symmetric tensor?

00:42:25.102 --> 00:42:26.630
If a is an
anti-symmetric tensor,

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.870
you've got symmetry, anti
symmetry, and it dies.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.420
So that is one example of where
you can actually apply it.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.840
And I had you guys play with
that a little bit on the PSET.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.780
It's worth noting though that
the main reason why one often

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.300
finds this to be a
useful thing to do

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.810
is that when you take the
divergence of something

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.570
like a vector, you
get a scalar out.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.570
You get a quantity that is--

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.490
really its
transformation properties

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.400
between different inertial
frames or freely-falling frames

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.940
is simple.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.290
So even when you can do this and
take advantage of this thing,

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:13.028
working with the
divergence of a tensor--

00:43:13.028 --> 00:43:15.320
exploiting a trick like this
turns out to generally not

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.240
be all that useful.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.000
And I'll use the example of
the stress energy tensor.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.390
So conservation of stress
energy in special relativity--

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.802
it was the partial derivative--

00:43:27.802 --> 00:43:29.260
the divergence of
the stress energy

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.093
tensor expressed with
the partial derivative

00:43:31.093 --> 00:43:32.200
was equal to 0.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.555
We're going to take this
over to covariant derivative

00:43:34.555 --> 00:43:36.430
of the stress energy
tensor being equal to 0.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.810
That's what the equivalence
principle tells us

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:38.435
that we can do.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.600
Now when I take the divergence
of something like the stress

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.820
energy tensor, I get a 4 vector.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.130
Every 4 vector
always has implicitly

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:54.138
a set of basis objects
attached to it.

00:43:54.138 --> 00:43:55.930
When I've got basis
objects attached to it,

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.008
those are defined with
respect to the tangent space

00:43:59.008 --> 00:44:00.550
at a particular
point in the manifold

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.260
where you are currently working.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.680
And so if I want to try to do
something like an integral like

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.190
this-- where I add up the
four vector I get by taking

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.220
the divergence of stress
energy and integrate it over

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.330
a volume--

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.180
I'm going to get nonsense
because what's going on

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.880
is I'm combining vector
fields that are defined

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.060
in different tangent spaces
that can't be properly compared

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.710
to one another.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.400
In order to do that
kind of comparison,

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.520
you have to introduce
a transport law.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.160
And when you start
doing transports

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.060
over macroscopic regions,
you run into trouble.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.370
They turn out to
be path dependent.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.430
And this is where we
run into ambiguities

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.180
that have to do with
the curvature content

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.560
of your manifold.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.440
We'll discuss where that
comes into our calculations

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.610
a little bit later.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:49.270
But what it basically
boils down to is

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:51.850
if I use a stress energy
tensor as an example,

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:56.050
this equation tells me
about local conservation

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:59.520
of energy and momentum.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.720
In general relativity I cannot
take the local conservation

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.120
of energy and momentum
and promote it to a global

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.130
conservation of
energy and momentum.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.510
It's ambiguous.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:15.910
We'll deal with that and
the conceptual difficulties

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.100
that that presents a little
bit later in the course.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.850
But it's a good see the
plant at this point.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.350
So let's switch gears.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.570
We have a new set of
mathematical tools.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:35.860
I want to take a detour away
from thinking about some more

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.070
abstract mathematical notions
and start thinking about how

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.300
we actually do some physics.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.200
So what I want to do
is talk today about how

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.980
do we formulate the
kinematics of a body

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.698
moving in curved spacetime?

00:46:08.427 --> 00:46:10.010
So I've already
hinted at this in some

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.000
of my previous lectures.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.375
And what I want
to do now is just

00:46:12.375 --> 00:46:14.990
basically fill in
some of the gaps.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.470
The way that we do
this really just

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.940
builds on Einstein's
insight about what

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.500
the weak equivalence
principle means.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.320
So go into a freely
falling frame.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.870
Go in that freely-falling frame.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:42.160
Put things into locally
Lorentz coordinates.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.538
In other words perform
that little calculation

00:46:44.538 --> 00:46:46.330
that make spacetime
look like the spacetime

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.219
of special relativity of
the curvature corrections.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.490
And to start with, let's
consider what we always

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.440
do in physics, is we'll look
at the simplest body first.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.440
We're going to look at
what we call a test body.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:22.150
So this is the body that has
no charge, no spatial extent,

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:29.920
it's of zero dimensional
point, no spin--

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.580
nothing interesting,
except a mass.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:44.360
So if you want to
think about this--

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.430
I use a way that I find
to think about this

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:51.200
is all these various aspects to
it, you're adding additional--

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.800
either charges to it or
additional multipolar structure

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.090
to this body.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.090
I'm thinking of this-- this is
sort of like a pure monopole.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.920
It's nothing but
mass concentrated

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.680
in a single zero size point.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.299
Obviously it's an idealization.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.716
But you've got to
start somewhere.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:18.920
So since it's got no
charge, no spatial extent,

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.803
it's got nothing
but mass, nothing's

00:48:22.803 --> 00:48:23.720
going to couple to it.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.685
It's not going to basically
do anything but freefall.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:49.906
In this frame the body moves on
a purely inertial trajectory.

00:49:04.262 --> 00:49:06.470
And what does a purely
inertial trajectory look like?

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:11.360
Well you take whatever your
initial conditions are.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.490
And you move in a
straight line with respect

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.560
to time as measured
on your own clock.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.670
Simplest, stupidest possible
motion that you can.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.890
So we would obviously call that
a straight line with respect

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.390
to the parameterization
that's being

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:43.740
used in this representation.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.640
So what does that mean
in a more general sense

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.730
of the representation?

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.300
So if we think about this a
little bit more geometrically,

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.780
when a body is moving in a
straight line, that basically

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.250
means that whatever the tangent
vector to its world line is,

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.540
it's essentially moving such
that the tangent vector at time

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:08.550
T1 is parallel to the tangent
vector at T1 plus delta T1,

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.160
provided that's
actually small enough

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.010
that they're sort of within
the same local Lorentz frame.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:20.120
So a more geometric way of
thinking about this motion

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.110
is that it's parallel
transporting its tangent

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:22.610
vector.

00:51:13.858 --> 00:51:15.650
Let's make this a little
bit more rigorous.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.150
So let's imagine
this body's moving

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.983
on a particular trajectory
through spacetime.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.840
So it's a trajectory
parameterized.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.250
I will define its
parameterization a little bit

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.440
more carefully very soon.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:42.090
So for now, just think of lambda
as some kind of a quantity.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.420
It's a scale that just
accumulates uniformly as it

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.000
moves along the world line.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.620
So I'm going to say
the small body has

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:55.900
a path through spacetime,
given by u x of lambda.

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:08.190
Its tangent is given by this.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:10.590
And if it is parallel
transporting its own tangent

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:24.753
vector, that is--

00:52:24.753 --> 00:52:26.170
I'll remind you
that the condition

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:31.950
for parallel
transport was that you

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.080
take the covariant
derivative your field.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.670
And as you are moving
along, you contract it

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.370
along the tangent vector of the
trajectory you're moving on.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.260
And you get 0.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:48.600
So in my notes, there's a
couple of equivalent ways

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.280
of writing this.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.000
So you will sometimes
see this written

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.320
as the gradient along u of u.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:06.970
And you'll sometimes see
this written as capital u

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.108
u lambda equals 0.

00:53:08.108 --> 00:53:08.900
So these are just--

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.790
I just throw that
out because these

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.915
are different forms that
are common in the notation

00:53:11.915 --> 00:53:12.842
that you will see.

00:53:12.842 --> 00:53:14.050
So let's expand this guy out.

00:53:39.018 --> 00:53:40.060
It's something like this.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.870
So what we're going to do-- so
remember this is dx d lambda.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.438
This is d by dx.

00:53:46.438 --> 00:53:48.730
That's a total derivative
with respect to the parameter

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:49.230
lambda.

00:53:51.712 --> 00:53:52.420
So this becomes--

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.590
I'm going to write
it in two forms.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.070
This is often written expanding
out the u into a second order

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:11.570
form.

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.230
This is obvious but
sufficiently important.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:26.900
It's worth calling it out.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.410
And this has earned
itself a box.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.930
This result is known as
the geodesic equation.

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.040
The trajectories which
solve these equations

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.520
are known as geodesics.

00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:25.580
One of the reasons why I
highlight this is it's--

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.610
I'm trying to keep a straight
face with the comment I

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:33.600
want to make.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.350
A tremendous amount of
research in general relativity

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:41.670
is based around doing
solutions of this equation

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:45.060
for various spacetimes that
go in to make the Christoffel

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.370
symbols.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:54.240
My career-- [LAUGHS] it's
probably not false to say that

00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:00.720
about 65% of my papers have
this equation at its centerpiece

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.540
at some point with the
thing that goes into making

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.860
my gammas--

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:08.190
things related to
black hole spacetimes.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:12.450
This is really important
because this gives me the motion

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.260
of a freely-falling frame.

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.380
What does a freely-falling
frame describe?

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.610
Somebody who's
moving under gravity.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:21.420
So when you're doing things like
describing orbits, for example,

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.700
this is your tool.

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.350
A tremendous number
of applications

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:27.840
where if what you care
about is the motion

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.450
of a body due to
relativistic gravity,

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.580
this gives you a
leading solution.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.190
Now bear in mind
when I did this,

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:36.900
this is the motion
of a test body.

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.880
This is an object
with no charge,

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.730
no spatial extent, no spin--

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.570
that describes no object.

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:49.080
So it should be borne
in mind that this is

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.110
the leading solution to things.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.170
Suppose the body is charged.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:56.130
And there is an
electromagnetic field

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.410
that this body is
interacting with.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:01.170
Then what you do is
you are no longer going

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.900
to be parallel transporting
this tangent factor.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.733
It will be pushed
away-- we like to say--

00:57:05.733 --> 00:57:06.900
from the parallel transport.

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.180
And you'll replace the
0 on the right hand side

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.550
here with a
properly-constructed force

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.730
that describes the
interactions of those charges

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:17.280
with the fields.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.770
Suppose the body has some size.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.650
Well then what ends up happening
is that the body actually

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.020
doesn't just couple to a
single-- remember what's

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:29.190
going on here is that in
the freely falling frame,

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:32.490
I'm imagining that spacetime
is flat at some point.

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:35.183
And in a decent enough
vicinity of that point,

00:57:35.183 --> 00:57:36.600
the first order
corrections are 0.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.610
But there might be
second order corrections.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:41.040
Well imagine a body is
so big that it fills

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.800
that freely-falling frame.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.368
And it actually tastes those
second order corrections.

00:57:46.368 --> 00:57:47.910
Then what's going
to happen is you're

00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:50.320
going to get additional
terms on this equation, which

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.200
have to do with the coupling of
the spatial extent of that body

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.780
to the curvature
of the spacetime.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:00.580
That is where-- so for people
who study astrophysical systems

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.970
involving binaries, when
you have spinning bodies,

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:06.400
that ends up actually--
you cannot describe a body

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.950
that's spinning without it
having some spatial extent.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.830
And you find terms here that
involve coupling of those

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:14.720
spins to the curvature
of the spacetime.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.910
So this is the leading piece
of the motion of a body moving

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.680
in the current spacetime.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.460
And it's enough to do
a tremendous amount.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:27.470
Basically because gravity is
just so bloody strong that all

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.792
of these various things--

00:58:28.792 --> 00:58:30.250
it's the weakest
fundamental force.

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:33.340
But it adds up because
it's only got one sine.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.190
And when you're dealing
with some of these things,

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.770
it really ends up being the
coupling to the monopole--

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:40.540
the most important thing.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.210
So all these other terms
that come in and correct this

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:45.430
are small enough that
we can add them in.

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:48.610
And that, to be blunt,
is modern research.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.370
So let me make a couple
of comments about this.

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.145
A more general form--

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.930
this will help to clarify what
the meaning of that lambda

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:03.650
actually is.

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:21.700
Suppose that as my vector is
transported along itself--

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:24.940
so one way is recall how we
derive parallel transport.

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:28.810
We imagine going into
a freely-falling frame

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:30.580
and a Lorentz representation.

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.782
And we said, in that
frame, I'm going

00:59:32.782 --> 00:59:34.240
to imagine moving
this thing along,

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.240
holding all the components
constants-- that

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.430
defined parallel transport.

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:43.900
Imagine that I don't keep
the components constant,

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.270
but I hold them all in a
constant ratio with respect

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:49.090
to each other, but I allow
the overall magnitude

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:50.380
to expand or contract.

00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:03.420
So suppose we allow the
vector's normalization

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.220
to change as it slides along.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.330
Well the way I
would mathematically

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:24.860
formulate this is I'm going
to use a notation that

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.540
looks like this.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.920
So recall this capital
D-- it's a shorthand

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:38.630
for this combination
of the tangent

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.997
and the covariant derivative.

01:00:41.997 --> 01:00:43.580
I'm going to call
the parameterization

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.650
I use when I set up
like this lambda star,

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.775
for reasons that I hope
will be clear in just about

01:00:47.775 --> 01:00:49.100
two minutes.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.070
So what I'm basically saying
is that as I move along,

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.098
I don't keep the
components constant.

01:00:54.098 --> 01:00:55.640
But I keep them
proportional to where

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.238
they were on the previous step.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:00:59.780
But I allow their magnitude to
change by some function, which

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.530
I'll call a kappa.

01:01:08.573 --> 01:01:10.490
So you might look at
that and think, you know,

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.220
that's a more general
kind of transport law.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.970
It seems to describe physically
a very similar situation here.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:20.000
It's kind of annoying that
this normalization is changing.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.940
Is there anything
going on with this?

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:29.930
Well what you guys are going
to do as a homework exercise,

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:32.525
you're going to
prove that if this

01:01:32.525 --> 01:01:34.310
is the situation
you're in, you've

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:36.140
chosen a dumb parameterization.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.780
And you can actually
convert this

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.060
to the normal geodesic
parameterization

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.520
by just relabeling your lambda.

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:59.910
So we can always
reparameterize this, such

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:03.480
that the right-hand side is 0.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.460
And right-hand side
being 0 corresponds

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.010
to the transport vector
remaining constant

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.670
as it moves along.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.070
So I'll just quickly sketch--

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:18.050
so imagine there exists some
different parameterization,

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.790
which I will call lambda.

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:32.480
So imagine something that gives
me my normal parallel transport

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.180
exists.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:40.970
And I have a different one that
involves the star parameter.

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:43.700
You can actually show that these
two things describe exactly

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:50.630
the same motion, but with lambda
and the dumb parameterization,

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:56.090
lambda star, related to each
other by a particular integral.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.820
So what this shows
us is we can always--

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.400
as long as I'm talking about
motion where I'm in this

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.260
regime-- where there's
no forces acting--

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.510
it's not an extended body--
it's just a test body--

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:16.557
I can always put
it into a regime

01:03:16.557 --> 01:03:18.890
where it'll [INAUDIBLE]
geodesic and the right-hand side

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.030
is equal to 0.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.860
If I'm finding
that's not the case,

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.820
I need to adjust my
parameterization.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.550
When you are, in fact,
in a prioritization

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:33.650
such as the
right-hand side is 0,

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.822
you are using what is called
an affine parameterization.

01:03:36.822 --> 01:03:38.530
That's a name that's
worth knowing about.

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:01.910
So your intuition is that
the affine parameterization--

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:03.410
I described this
in words last time.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:06.035
And this just helps to make it
a little bit more mathematically

01:04:06.035 --> 01:04:07.440
precise what those words mean.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:25.340
Affine parameters
correspond to the tick marks

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:38.065
on the world line,
being uniformly spaced

01:04:38.065 --> 01:04:39.190
in the local Lorentz frame.

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:47.670
If you are working with
time-like trajectories--

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:51.420
which if you're a physicist,
you will be much of the time--

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.030
a really good choice
of the affine parameter

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:58.020
is the proper time of a body
moving through the spacetime.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.050
That is something that
is uniformly spaced,

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:02.010
assuming that's--

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.030
you don't have to
assume anything.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.405
Just by definition
it's the thing

01:05:04.405 --> 01:05:07.080
that uniformly measures
the time as experienced

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.995
by that observer.

01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:54.130
So this is-- you guys are
going to do on PSET 4--

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.140
this is the exercise you
need to do to convert

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.360
a nonaffine
parameterized geodesic

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.270
to an affine parameterized one.

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:03.100
That kind of
parameterization is not

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:09.960
too hard to show that if we
adjust the parameterization

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.920
in a linear fashion--

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:25.160
so in other words, let's say I
go from lambda to some lambda

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.220
prime, which is equal
to a lambda plus b,

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.700
where and b are both constants--

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.195
we get a new affine
parameterization.

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:45.510
But that's the only class
of reparamterizations

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:46.593
that allows me to do that.

01:06:49.288 --> 01:06:50.580
And hopefully that makes sense.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.100
If you imagine that
you're using proper time

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.440
as your reparameterization,
this is basically

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.690
saying that you just chose
a different origin for when

01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:58.648
you started your clock.

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.690
And this means you changed
the units in which you

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:01.560
are measuring time.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.060
That's all.

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:11.780
So I'm going to skip a
bunch of the details.

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.940
But I'm going to scan
and put up the notes

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.580
corresponding to one
other route to getting

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:20.227
to the geodesic equation, which
I think it's definitely worth

01:07:20.227 --> 01:07:20.810
knowing about.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:36.328
It connects very nicely to other
work in classical mechanics.

01:07:36.328 --> 01:07:38.870
So it's a bit of a shame we're
going to need to skip over it.

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:41.030
But we're a little
bit behind pace.

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.590
And this is
straightforward enough

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:45.950
that I feel OK posting the
notes that you can read it.

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:50.910
So there is a second
path to geodesics.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.380
So recall the way that we
argued how to get the geodesic

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.205
equation, which we
said we're going to go

01:08:02.205 --> 01:08:04.330
into-- it's actually in
the board right above where

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.410
I'm writing right now--

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:07.120
go into the
freely-falling frame.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.070
I have a body that isn't
coupling to anything

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:10.270
but gravity.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:11.870
Therefore in the
freely-falling frame,

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:13.270
it just maintains its momentum.

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.190
It's going to go
in a straight line.

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:17.590
Straight means parallel
transporting tangent vector--

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:20.830
math, math, math-- and
that's how we get all that.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.569
So what this boiled
down to is I was

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:26.109
trying to make rigorous in a
geometric sense what straight

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:28.620
meant.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.222
There's another
notion of straight

01:08:30.222 --> 01:08:31.930
that one can imagine
applying when you're

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:33.013
working in a curved space.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.740
So your intuition for--

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.529
if you're talking about how
do I make a straight line

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:42.960
between two points on a globe--

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.689
your intuition is you say,
oh, well the straightest line

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:48.330
that I can make is the
path that is shortest.

01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.460
We're going to
formulate-- and I'll

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.165
leave the details
and the calculation

01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:24.790
to the notes-- we're
going to formulate

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:26.920
how one can apply
a similar thing

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.600
to the notion of geodesics.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:36.760
So imagine I've got an event
p here and event q up here.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:43.750
And I ask myself, what is
the accumulated proper time

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:48.939
experienced by all
possible paths that take me

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:50.368
from event p to event q?

01:09:50.368 --> 01:09:51.910
I'm going to need
to restrict myself.

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:54.285
I want it to be something that
an observer can physically

01:09:54.285 --> 01:09:56.730
ride-- so all the
time-like trajectories that

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:59.050
connect event p to event q.

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.660
So I've got one a path
that goes like this,

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.735
got a path that goes like this,
path that goes like this, path

01:10:04.735 --> 01:10:06.610
goes like this, path
goes like-- some of them

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:08.270
might have just become
somewhat space like,

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.460
so I should rule them out.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.380
But you get the idea.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.880
Imagine I take all the
possible time-like paths

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.230
that connect p and q.

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:22.600
Some of those paths will
involve strong accelerations.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.690
So they will not be
the freefall path.

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.260
Among them there will be
one that corresponds exactly

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:28.760
to freefall.

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:45.540
So if I were talking about--
imagine I was trying to--

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:48.560
and this is something that
Muslim astronomers worked out

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.810
long, long ago-- they wanted
to know the shortest path

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:53.660
from some point on
earth towards Mecca.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.680
And so you need to find what
the shortest distance was

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.680
for something like that.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.290
And when you're doing this
on the surface of a sphere,

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.137
that's complicated.

01:11:02.137 --> 01:11:03.720
And that's where the
qibla arose from,

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.210
was working out the mathematics
to know how to do this.

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:07.730
This is a similar
kind of concept.

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.860
I'm trying to define--

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:13.740
in this case, it's going to turn
out it's not the shortest path,

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.600
but it's the path on which an
observer ages the most because

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.400
as soon as you
accelerate someone--

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.000
it's not hard.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.542
Go back to some of
those problem sets

01:11:21.542 --> 01:11:23.840
you guys did where you look
at accelerated observers.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.720
Acceleration tends to decrease
the amount of aging you have

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.370
as you move through some
interval of spacetime.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:33.920
So the path that has
no acceleration on it,

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.480
this is going to be the one on
which an observer is maximally

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:36.980
aged.

01:11:47.065 --> 01:11:48.440
Why maximum instead
of a minimum?

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.810
Well it comes down to
the bloody minus sign

01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:53.780
that enters into the
timepiece of an interval

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:55.052
that we have in relativity.

01:11:55.052 --> 01:11:56.510
And that's all I'll
say about that,

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:58.970
is just boils down to that.

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:03.350
So what we want to do
is say, well along all

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:06.380
of these trajectories,
the amount

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.648
of proper time that's
accumulated-- so let's

01:12:09.648 --> 01:12:11.690
just say that every one
of these is parameterized

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:15.440
by some lambda that describes
the motion along these things.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.890
This is the amount
of proper time

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:39.400
that someone accumulates
as they move from point p--

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.688
which is at-- let's say this
is defined as lambda equals 0--

01:12:42.688 --> 01:12:44.980
and it's indeterminate what
that top lambda is actually

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.480
going to be.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.860
It's whatever it takes when
you get up to lambda of q.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:58.020
So what the notes
I'm going to post do,

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.530
is they define an
action principle that

01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:05.445
can be applied to understand
what the trajectory is

01:13:05.445 --> 01:13:06.570
that allows you to do this.

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.760
So I'll just hit the highlights.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:37.060
So in notes to be posted,
I show that this delta t--

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.150
this delta tau rather--

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:45.580
this can be used to
define an action.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.410
It looks like this.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.820
And then if you
vary the action--

01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:29.760
or rather you do a variation
of your trajectory--

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.630
where you require that the
action remain stationary under

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:42.610
that variation-- in other words
I require delta i equals 0 as x

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:43.420
goes over to such--

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:08.840
so-- what you wind up with--

01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:25.715
is delta i equals--

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.340
Notice what I've got in here.

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.790
This is just a
Christoffel symbol.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:25.715
So when I do this
variation, what I find--

01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:28.950
and by the way going from
essentially that board

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:33.080
to that board, it's about
2/3 a page of algebra.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.850
Going down to this
one, there's a bunch

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:36.683
of straightforward but
fairly tedious stuff.

01:16:36.683 --> 01:16:38.985
It's one reasons why I'm
skipping over the details.

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:40.610
We've got enough G
mu nus on the board.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:08.250
So the key point is I am going
to require that my action be

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:11.850
stationary, independent of
the nature of the variation

01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:13.150
that I make.

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:16.110
For that to be true,
the quantity in braces

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:20.057
here must be equal to 0.

01:17:20.057 --> 01:17:21.640
Let me just write
that down over here.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.682
This is a good place to
conclude today's lecture.

01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:45.390
So we require this to
be 0 for any variation.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:18:00.020
Yet the bracketed term
being equal to 0, pull that

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:07.390
out, and clear out that factor
of the metric with an inverse,

01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:09.860
you've got your
geodesic equation back.

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.590
So we just quickly wrap this up.

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:15.080
So it's worth looking
over these notes.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080
It's not worth going
through them in gory detail

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.705
on the board, which
is why I'm skipping

01:18:18.705 --> 01:18:20.020
a few pages of these things.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:23.500
But what this demonstrates
is that geodesics--

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.780
our original
definition is that they

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:33.380
carry the notion of a straight
line in a straightforward way

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:39.470
from where they are obvious
in a locally Lorentz frame

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:41.240
to a more covariant
formulation of that--

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:55.170
so a generalized straight
line to a curved spacetime.

01:18:55.170 --> 01:19:08.500
And they give the trajectory of
extremal aging in other words

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.850
a trajectory along which
between two points in spacetime,

01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:15.520
an observer moving from
one to the other will

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.060
accumulate the most proper time.

01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:26.380
So I'm going to stop here.

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.748
There's a bit more,
which I would like to do,

01:19:28.748 --> 01:19:30.040
but I just don't have the time.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.940
But I'll tell you the key
things that I want to say next.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.060
Everything that I've
done here so far

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:41.367
is I've really fixated on
time-like trajectories.

01:19:41.367 --> 01:19:43.450
I've imagined there's a
body with some finite rest

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:47.500
mass where I can make a
sensible notion of proper time.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.000
We are also going
to want to talk

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.750
about the behavior of light.

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:53.590
Light moves on
null trajectories.

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:58.660
I cannot sensibly define proper
time on long such a trajectory.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.500
They are massless.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.667
There's all sorts of
properties associated with them

01:20:01.667 --> 01:20:03.250
that just make this analysis.

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:05.260
The way I've done
it so far, I'll

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.188
need to tweak things a little
bit in order for it to work.

01:20:08.188 --> 01:20:09.230
We will do that tweaking.

01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:11.290
It's actually quite
straightforward

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:14.110
and allows us to also bring
in a bit more intuition

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:16.210
about what affine parameters
mean when we do that.

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:17.680
So that'll be the
one thing we do.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.780
The other-- it's unfortunate
I wasn't able to get to it

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:21.620
today-- but it's a
straightforward saying,

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.100
which I think I may include
in the notes that I post--

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.420
is including what happens,
if your spacetime--

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.570
so if the metric you use to
generate these Christoffels has

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.860
a Killing factor
associated with it,

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.770
you can combine
Killing's equation

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.360
with the geodesic
equation to prove

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.570
the existence of conserved
quantities associated

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:41.343
with that motion.

01:20:41.343 --> 01:20:42.760
And that's where
we start to begin

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.150
to see that if I
have a spacetime that

01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:48.850
is independent of time, there's
a notion of conserved energy

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:50.020
associated with it.

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.410
So we will do that on Tuesday.

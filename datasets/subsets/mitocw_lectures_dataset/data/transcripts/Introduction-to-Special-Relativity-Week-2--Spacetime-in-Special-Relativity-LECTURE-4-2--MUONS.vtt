00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.390
PROFESSOR: Welcome back to
8.20, special relativity.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.950
In the last section,
we discussed

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.250
that moving clocks
tick differently

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.440
than those which are at rest.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.310
And here, I would
like to discuss

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.430
real life example of this.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.400
The muon is an
elementary particle

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.110
very similar to the electron.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.000
It's mass is about
200 times as heavy.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.340
The muon was
discovered in the 1930s

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.760
by Anderson and
Neddermeyer at Caltech.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.150
And it's really one of
my favorite particles

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.200
because you can--

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.130
they are abundant.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.490
There's many of them
in cosmic air showers.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.040
You can study them, you
can study their lifetime.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.080
You can even calculate the
lifetime on a piece of paper.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.580
So what Anderson
and Neddermeyer did

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.390
is they just basically
went outside and discovered

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.620
a particle which
comes from the sky.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.270
And so they studied
cosmic radiation.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.490
Muons are produced in
cosmic air showers,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.820
and we look at one of
those a little later.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.400
Basically, protons hits
the upper atmosphere,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.120
and in a shower of
various particles,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.980
muons are being produced.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.410
And then those muons are
not stable particles,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.530
but they are stable
enough to reach us.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.890
On average, if you hold
out your hand right now,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.210
about one muon travels through
your hand every second.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.710
How is this possible?

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.560
So if you look at this
muon, it gives you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.320
a little bit of particle
physics explanation here.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.260
Again, the muon is
not a stable particle.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.180
They decay via the
weak interaction.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.280
For those who are
interested, this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.070
is a Feynman diagram
for this decay.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.300
The muon couples to the w,
and as a result of the decay,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.450
you find an electron, an
anti-electron neutrino,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.430
and the muon [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.230
The lifetime is about
2.2 microseconds--

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.110
2.2 times 10 to the
minus 6 seconds.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.580
And I just taught 8.701
which is introductory class

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.440
into particle and
nuclear physics,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.810
and the students
calculated the lifetime

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.230
of a muon in that class.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.390
So you can calculate this.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.460
And you need a few tools, but
it's not that hard after all.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.290
The average velocity
of the muons

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.830
when they're being produced is
close to the speed of light,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.900
or 0.998 times the
speed of light.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.790
And if you do a
classical calculation,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820
and you want to figure
out how long do the muons

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.440
on average live--

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.550
fly, you find that this
is about 660 meters.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.920
Now they are produced
in the upper atmosphere,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.270
and nevertheless, we can
find them down here on Earth.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.207
So something is not quite right.

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:54.290
What is not quite right--
you can already assume--

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.940
is that the clock in the
muon as observed by us

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.610
ticks much, much slower
than for the muon at rest.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.790
And so the lifetime of the
muon of 2.2 microseconds

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.540
is basically extended.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.180
If you calculate this--
this is average velocity--

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.360
we find gamma factor of 15.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.760
Using the equation we--

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.090
[? of ?] time dilation, you
just simply multiply 15 times

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.270
2.2 microseconds, and you
find that muons, indeed,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.450
reach our hand on
the surface of Earth.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.250
This is a really fun example.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.010
Again, you can study
those cosmic showers,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.070
those muons, and
learn about the muons

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.365
in very simple experiments.

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:43.990
This picture here shows you one
of those air shower formations.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.740
So the story is a
little bit more complex.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.970
As I explain, this is a
spectacular air shower,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.490
or a picture of
one, where you have

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.290
an [INAUDIBLE] coming
in at an energy

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.900
of 10 to 15 electronvolts.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.030
And so even its lower energies
show us look like the one here.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.690
It produces, in collision
with the atmosphere,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.320
many, many particles-- pions,
protons, additional protons,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.540
neutrons, and pions again.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.840
And those pions then,
they decay into muons.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.570
And this all happens in
the upper atmosphere,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.000
but also in some
cases, further down.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.490
So here, we have
seen now an example

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.380
which you can actually
see and observe

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.410
in nature, where particles
travel with high speed.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.090
And there are
relativistic effects

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.990
we can measure and observe.

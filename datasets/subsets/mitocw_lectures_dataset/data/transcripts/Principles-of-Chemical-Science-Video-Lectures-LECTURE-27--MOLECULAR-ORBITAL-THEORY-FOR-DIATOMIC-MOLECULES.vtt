00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
At the end of last hour,
we had just gotten to the point

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of having developed the
molecular orbital energy level

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
diagram for the BH three
molecule, this trigonal planar

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
entity.
And I had not had time last

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
hour to show you what these
molecular orbitals look like in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
their calculated form.
And so, I am going to start off

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
today by doing that,
and then will proceed to answer

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
a quadrangle of questions that
we can attack regarding diatomic

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
molecules using molecular
orbital theory.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Remember that the BH three
MO problem is a seven

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
orbital problem.
And so, we will go through and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
just look at these seven
molecular orbitals in ascending

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
energy from the lowest energy on
up.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This one is the lowest energy
molecular orbital for BH three

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as calculated using a
modern quantum chemical package.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And what you can see is that
since we are indicating the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
phase of the wave function by
color, there is only one phase

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to be seen.
This, of course,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is a characteristic property of
an s orbital.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Remember that?
And what we have here,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
at the center of the molecule,
is the 2s orbital on boron.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And in this molecular orbital
theory, effectively what is

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
happening is that 2s orbital on
boron is reaching out and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
simultaneously overlapping with
the three 1s orbitals on each of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the hydrogens.
And the way that we have

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
orthogonalized it and normalized
it amounts to a single molecular

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
orbital that can,
if you will,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
house a pair of electrons in
this orbital that is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
simultaneously bonding between
boron and the three hydrogens.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You have one electron pair in
here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Two of the six electrons in the
valance shell of this molecule

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
are in this lowest lying,
most tightly held,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
most electronegative molecular
orbital.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let's look now at the next one.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You should be thinking in your
mind just what was the next

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
highest lying orbital that we
had, and you will realize that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
this is an orbital formed from
one of the boron p orbitals and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a linear combination of two of
the hydrogen wave functions.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And let's see if you can
recognize it based on what we

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
did last time.
Maybe I can reorient it to help

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in that regard.
Here is a molecular orbital

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that can house a pair of
electrons, one spin-up and one

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
spin-down, and that is
simultaneously bonding from that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
boron to this hydrogen,
up here.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And then there is a nodal
surface, here,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that is coincident with the
nodal surfaces of the boron 2px

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
orbital, using the same
coordinate system that we were

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
using last time.
And so, the wave function

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
changes sign as you pass through
the boron.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And then the opposite phase
lobe of the boron 2px orbital is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
able to overlap with these two
hydrogens, here.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
If you will remember,
when I wrote down the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
normalization constants for this
molecular orbital,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we had double the coefficient
on the hydrogen up here as

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
compared with the two hydrogens
down here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And they were opposite in sign.
And that leads to a really nice

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
overlap, as you can see here.
This is BH bonding here,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and BH bonding,
down here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And it involves that boron 2px
orbital.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
One way you can think about
this molecular orbital theory is

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that this 2px orbital on the
central atom is reaching out

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with its intrinsic plus-minus
phase combination that is

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
intrinsic to a 2px orbital
simultaneously reaching out and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
bonding with all three hydrogens
in the only way that it can,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
being a 2px orbital.
And so, we created that linear

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
combination with that idea in
mind.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And then, if we go up one more
in energy, strike that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Not one up more in energy,
but to the other orbital in the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
molecule that is at the same
energy.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What we will find is that we
are involving,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
now, the 2py orbital.
And it will reach out and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
interact with hydrogens in the
only way it can,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
given its intrinsic nodal
properties as a 2py orbital.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Remember that a 2py orbital has
the x,z-plane as a nodal

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
surface.
And there is a hydrogen up here

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
on that x,z-plane,
namely the one that lies on the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
plus x-axis.
And because it lies on the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
intrinsic nodal surface of this
2py orbital, it can contribute

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
nothing to this molecular
orbital.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
All we are seeing up here at
the top is an arbitrarily sized

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
sphere, just to show the
location of that nucleus,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the hydrogen nucleus that is on
the plus x-axis.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And then here,
what you see is the 2py orbital

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
oriented along y and overlapping
simultaneously with a plus 1s

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
wave function here and minus 1s
wave function here so that you

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
see a beautiful bonding
molecular orbital that is at the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
same energy at the one we just
looked at.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And so, as you step up in
energy, looking at the energy

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
level diagram for BH three
from last time,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that is what you see.
We have now six electrons in

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the molecule,
two in this orbital and two

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
each in the two orbitals we just
looked at that provide the three

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
BH bonds that we represent in
the valance bond theory as

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
electron pair bonds.
But this is a totally different

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
way of looking at the electronic
structure that is very appearing

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because it just takes advantage
of the atomic orbital properties

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that you would calculate for
your central atom.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Now, let's go up one more.
The very next one,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I will skip showing to you for
purposes of saving time,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
here, but you know that the
next orbital up is simply the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
2pz orbital on the boron,
which is our lowest unoccupied

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
molecular orbital,
as well as being an atomic

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
orbital in this system and
responsible for the Lewis acid

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
characteristics of this species.
And one up above that,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
one higher in energy than the
LUMO is the orbital that I did

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
show you last time,
the out-of-phase combination of

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the boron 2s with the three
hydrogens all with the same

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
sign.
It is sort of a round nodal

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
surface intersection each of the
BH bonds.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And then, finally,
orbitals number six and seven

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
are the antibonding counterparts
to the ones that I just showed

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
you involving boron's 2px and
2py wave functions.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Here is what these look like.
And this one,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you will see,
involves the 2px orbital.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Here is our x-axis pointing up.
And the blue lobe of 2px,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the positive lobe here,
as you can see,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is squished out and down.
These pictures can be a little

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
bit more complicated than what
we are used to looking at from

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
just sketching it out on the
board or the qualitative

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
pictures that you sometimes see
in your textbook.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But what we do find here that
is the important feature is that

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
as we go from the 1s
contribution on this hydrogen

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
over here to the positive lobe
of 2px we are going through a

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
nodal surface.
And that is antibonding in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
character.
And you can see that this

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
deformation of this lobe of the
p orbital, of course,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
looks like a high energy type
of phenomena.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And indeed it is.
This is one of the two highest

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
energy orbitals in the energy
level diagram for the BH three

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
molecule.
And then, similarly,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
here is the other lobe of the
2px orbital, the minus lobe.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And, as you try to go from it
to the adjacent hydrogens,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
remember, in the bonding one we
were allowing this to overlap

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
with the same sign on the
hydrogens.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Now we have the opposite sign
on the hydrogens,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
so that we have a beautiful
antibonding node indicated here

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and here between the minus phase
lobe of 2px and the adjacent

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
hydrogens.
So, this antibonding orbital

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
has lots of internuclear nodes,
nodes that appear between

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
nuclei and indicate that we are
not getting overlapped and

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
bonding, but rather we are
getting a high frequency orbital

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that is likewise high in energy.
Finally, I will show you the

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
counterpart to this one,
that involves 2py.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It is a little easier to
understand from inspecting it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And it also evinces the
internuclear nodes that you

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
would expect for an antibonding
molecular orbital.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And I am orienting it so that
you will be able to understand

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
it with reference to our
coordinate system as introduced

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
last time.
And so, you have the boron and

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the hydrogen along x,
up here.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Here is our 2py.
It is sort of bending away from

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
these two hydrogens whose wave
functions have opposite sign to

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
the lobes that are directed into
their vicinity.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You can see that we have here a
nodal surface between boron and

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
this hydrogen wherein the
bonding counterpart that we

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
looked at had the same sign and
a nice bond.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And then over here,
once again, the mirror image.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So, this is one of our final
orbitals in looking at the BH

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
three energy level
diagram.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It is the case that if you
start to put electrons into

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
antibonding orbitals,
they will cancel the bonding

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
properties of the bonding
counterparts.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And we will explore that in
quite a bit more detail here

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
shortly.
Let me leave that up there for

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
now and tell you what quadrangle
of problems it is that I hope to

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
answer for you today using more
MO theory ideas.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
First of these will be why He
two is so stable?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And so, today's lecture is
predominantly devoted to

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
diatomic molecules.
And He two will be the

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
first of these.
Let's make this unstable.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Let's do stable here in just a
moment, but first let's say,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
next, why does O two
have unpaired electrons?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Certainly, if we draw the
valance bond picture for O two,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
like that,
it does not give us any

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
indication that this diatomic
molecule would have unpaired

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
electrons.
And so, we are going to see how

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
MO theory can shed some light on
this issue.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then, the final two
questions that I will fold into

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
one line here given the way I am
using up space on this board is,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
why is N two so stable
--

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
-- and CO poison?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
MO theory can shed very clear
light on all of these questions.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And so, that is what we will
work on for the rest of the

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
hour.
In MO theory,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
there are a couple things you
should keep in mind when trying

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to grasp all the subtleties of a
given energy level diagram with

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
which you may be confronted in
your textbook or on an exam or

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
just through reading papers in
the Journal of the American

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Chemical Society,
wherever you may find these.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You should keep in mind that,
number one, interaction is

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
strong.
That is, when atomic orbitals

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
interact to form molecular
orbitals, the AO interaction is

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
strong --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
-- when there is good spatial
overlap.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Overlap is a central concept in
molecular orbital theory.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
The idea is that if you have
atoms that are far apart from

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
each other in space,
then their wave functions have

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
dropped off exponentially and
are not interacting much and

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
there is not good overlap.
But when orbitals are close in

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
space and if their orbitals are
directed in space toward one

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
another, then there may be
overlap that leads to good

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
bonding.
And also I can echo this first

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
part, AO interaction is strong
when, and say two,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
AOs are close in energy.
The interacting orbitals are

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
close in energy.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
When I talk about where atomic
orbitals are in energy,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I am going to really want you
to think about your periodic

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
table and the properties that
appear with periodicity and are

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
organized and collated in the
periodic table.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We are going to be talking
about properties like

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
electronegativity as it relates
to the energy.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And I will get to that a little
bit on the next board,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but let's first make a small MO
diagram here.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And this will be a diagram that
we may use both for H two

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
or He two.
This is the simplest of all MO

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
diagrams and one with which you
should be quite familiar.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We have a bonding molecular
orbital at low-end energy.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And notice that if this is a 1s
orbital over here and this is a

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
1s orbital over here for H two
or He two

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
systems, then when these come
together and bond,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
here are your two nuclei,
--

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
-- and here is a probability
density isosurface that I am

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
drawing around that shows
in-phase combination of those

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
two 1s orbitals merging with
each other, giving good overlap,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and the interacting AOs being
of the same energy.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Because the H two and He
two molecules have such

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
symmetry we have a good bonding
orbital.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And then, up here,
we must find there to be an

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
internuclear node in that
corresponding antibonding

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
orbital.
And so, it will look something

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
like this.
And, therefore,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I am going to associate with
this high-lying orbital an

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
asterisk to indicate the
antibonding character,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
the presence of this
internuclear node,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
the change of sign as we go
from one nucleus to the other,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
the absence of bonding
character.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Here we have the buildup of
electron density in the

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
internuclear region,
electrons being stabilized by

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
being held simultaneously by
more than one nucleus that is

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
positively charged.
And here, the exact inverse of

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
that, constructive interference
and destructive interference in

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
the H two or He two
systems.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And then we can ask,
how many electrons do we have

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
to put into the diagram?
If it is the H two case,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
then, to figure out the bond
order, --

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
-- what we do is populate the
diagram according to the same

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
kind of Aufbau principle that
you would for generating the

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
energy level diagram for an
atom, and taking into account

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
things like Hund's rule.
If it is H two,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
we have two electrons that we
can put in, which in here with

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
opposing spin,
like that.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
That is our bonding molecular
orbital.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
We have two bonding electrons.
Zero antibonding electrons

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
divided by two equals a bond
order of one.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
We have an H-H single bond in
the case of the H two

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
molecule.
But if we have He two,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
then in the He two system,
we have two more electrons,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and the only place they can go
is up here in the antibonding

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
molecular orbital.
We have two bonding minus two

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
antibonding over two is equal to
zero for a bond order of zero.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And so, the idea is that if two
He atoms collide with each

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
other, when they do so,
their orbitals may overlap and

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
give rise to bonding.
But, simultaneously,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
you get antibonding.
And the net bond order is zero,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
and so He two is not
bound, but these atoms just

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
bounce off each other.
There is no stabilization.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And you can certainly
understand that if we were in

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
the middle somewhere,
as we would be if we had He two

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
plus,
missing one electron up here,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
then our bond order would be
one-half.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
It is going to get a lot more
complicated than this,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
but this you have to know
because this is a really nice

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
starting point for thinking
about bonding in all kinds of

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
scenarios where you may need to
consider it.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And so, let's look at some
periodic properties.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
This will be with reference,
again, to energy.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And I am interested in how some
of the properties of the atoms

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
vary as we go across the
periodic table,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
lithium to beryllium to boron
to carbon to nitrogen to oxygen

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
and over to fluorine.
And I will stop there.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000
We won't worry about any more
of the noble gases today.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
As we go from left to right,
one of the things that you know

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
from your study of the periodic
table is that electronegativity

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
increases.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
This increases from left to
right across the Periodic Table

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
in concert with increasing Z.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
That is, the increasing atomic
number.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
That is, the increasing number
of positively charged protons in

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
our nucleus, as we go across.
Each time we are adding more

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
protons to that nucleus.
The nucleus is becoming more

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
and more positively charged as
we go across.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And an important consequence of
that has to do with the fact

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
that s orbitals don't have a
node at the nucleus.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Whereas, p orbitals do.
Since these elements are in the

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
so-called p block of our
periodic table,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
well, lithium in the s block,
but we will consider the

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
properties all the way across.
And the energy issue up here

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
that I am going to be concerned
with is the energy of the atomic

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
2s versus 2p orbitals as we go
from left to right across the

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
periodic table,
systematically adding to the

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
number of protons in our nucleus
in a way that does not affect 2s

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
orbitals the same way that it
affects 2p orbitals.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
It turns out that by the time
we get over to fluorine,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
where we have essentially our
most electronegative element,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
the 2s orbital has sunk to a
very low energy.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And the 2p orbital has gone
down in energy as well,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000
but just not by nearly as much.
And so, it is nearly an

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
isotonic function as we go
across.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000
2p is decreasing in energy in
response to this increased Z,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
but not as much as 2s is
decreasing in energy,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000
having to do with the fact that
2s electrons see much more of

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
the nucleus than 2p electrons do
because 2s electrons don't have

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
a node there.
They spend a lot more time in

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
close to the nucleus than do
your 2p electrons.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
This has a really important
influence on that set of

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
diatomic molecule MO theory
problems, eight orbital

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
problems, that we call homo or
heteronuclear diatomic molecules

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
of these elements.
And that has to do with the

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
fact that in between nitrogen
and oxygen, a fundamental change

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
takes place in the energy level
diagram.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And that change,
that results from the atomic

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
structure of the elements,
ends up with the result that

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
the MO diagram is much easier to
draw for oxygen,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
O two,
and fluorine,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
F two,
than it is for the earlier

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
ones.
And it is much easier to

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
understand for O two and
F two than it is for N

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
two, C two, B two,
Be two, Li two.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
So, let's just see what that
means.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
First of all,
when we are going to draw an

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
energy level diagram for a
diatomic molecule,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
if it is a homonuclear diatomic
molecule, meaning the two atoms

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
that are going to be bonded
together are the same,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
that means that the atomic
orbitals for the contributing

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
atoms are the same.
Here, on the left,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
what I am drawing is,
let's say, an F or an O atom.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
We have the 2s and the 2p,
x-y-z.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:58.000
That is four of the eight
orbitals in our problem.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And then, over here,
we have the other identical F

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:10.000
or O atom, with its 2p x-y-z and
2s orbitals at exactly the same

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
energy as for the counterpart,
over here.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
So, this is another F or O
atom.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And then we are going to ask,
how can these atomic orbitals

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
combine to give molecular
orbitals in these diatomic

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
molecules?
This is unlike the BH three

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
problem because there is
no atom at the center of gravity

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
of our system,
but the ideas are the same.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And the ideas are very much the
same as what we have here for H

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
two, where also we could
make molecular orbitals despite

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
the fact that there was no atom
at the center of our system.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
We can pretend that there is,
and we can use that pretend

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
atom to identify what linear
combinations we should make.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
A simpler way to do it,
at this point,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
would be to say that our
molecule has the two nuclei

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
oriented along the z-axis.
And then you have x and y

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
perpendicular to z.
And so, if we take this choice

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
of coordinate system that the
molecule is oriented along z,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
the two nuclei lie one on plus
z, one on minus z.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Then we can immediately
classify our atomic orbitals as

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000
being either sigma or pi with
respect to the z-axis.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
I will say AO is sigma or pi
with respect to z,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000
which is the molecular axis.
And remember what that means in

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
terms of the nodal properties.
If something is sigma with

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
respect to z,
that means if you view it down

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
z it will look like a cylinder.
It will look like a sphere,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
actually.
It will be cylindrically

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
symmetric about the z-axis.
If it is sigma then,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
if you are viewing down z,
you see that.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That could be either an s
orbital or it could be a pz

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
orbital.
They would look the same if you

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
were viewing right down z.
And then pi,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
viewing down z,
would look like this.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And that would be a px or a py
orbital perpendicular to the

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
z-axis.
And this would be an s orbital

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
or a pz orbital.
What I can say right away is

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
that we can separate out the
molecular orbitals that we are

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
going to form from these atomic
orbitals into their sigma or pi

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
characteristics relative to the
z-axis.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
And because we are in the O or
F atom case, very far on the

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
right-hand side the periodic
table, we have a large gap.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
This gap is large.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
We can make the approximation
that this 2s orbital here,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
which could in principle form a
sigma bond with this 2pz orbital

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
over here, that would be an
interaction looking like that,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
--
-- that that does not occur.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Because remember here I said
you get strong interaction when

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
the interacting AOs are close in
energy.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
When you are talking about
these very electronegative

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
elements, the s manifold of
orbitals is very well separated

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
in energy from the p manifold.
That leads to simplicity in the

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
case of the diagram that we are
about to draw.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Because we say that this
interacts with this in a sigma

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
fashion, giving rise to bonding
and antibonding interactions

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
that look exactly like what we
have drawn over there.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I will draw the bonding orbital
here.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Actually, the antibonding
orbital here and the bonding

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
orbital here.
And I will show the parentage

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
of this molecular orbitals in
this way.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And you will recognize that
this is our in-phase combination

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
and this is our out-of-phase
combination, analogous to the H

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
two problem.
This is like the H two

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
problem built into the F two
or the O two

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
problem.
And next what we find is that

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
we can also make a sigma bond by
interaction of pz with pz.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
This is going to be a nice
strong directed bonding

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
interaction that will look like
this.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
You see we have overlap here in
the center, a nice strong

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
bonding interaction in the
center with 2pz orbitals that

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
are directed at each other.
And this is a sigma bond

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
because you view that down z,
it is going to look like a

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
round thing.
You are not going to see any

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
nodal surfaces.
And then it has up here a

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
corresponding antibonding
orbital right there.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So far I have --

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
-- two pair-wise combinations
that give us two sigma bonding

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
orbitals and two sigma star
antibonding orbitals.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
So, that is pretty
straightforward.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And, once again,
I can say that we have the H

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
two problem built into
this energy level diagram twice,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
with the s interactions,
with the pz interactions.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
The only thing I have left is
to do my px and py interactions.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And we can make a pair of pi
bonds and a pair of pi

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
anti-bonds that corresponds to
those pi bonds.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
This one is pi.
This one is pi star.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And what do they look like?
Well, they look like

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
side-to-side bonds between pairs
of p orbitals.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
This is just like what I showed
you for the ethylene molecule.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
The pi bond,
in fact, has this nice overlap

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
on one side and up here on the
other.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
There is your pi bond.
And you have one of those that

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
lie in the x,z-plane and one of
those that lie in the y,z-plane.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
You have two of them,
and they are at equal energy

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
here.
And then up here,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
what does the pi star look
like?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Well, the same,
except we turn around one of

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
the p orbitals,
introducing a nodal surface,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
like that.
And we have two of those.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And here is our nodal surface.
Now it is an internuclear

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
between the nuclei nodal
surface, indicating antibonding

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
character there.
That is the easy case because s

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
and p are very well separated.
What you can see,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
though, is that type of
interaction of a 2s on our left

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
atom with a pz on the right
atom, that might start to become

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
important as you are over here
in this part of the diagram,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
where s and p are pretty close
together in energy.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
And that is what happens,
in fact.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And that is what happens as
soon as you go to the left of

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
oxygen and to nitrogen or
anything lighter than nitrogen.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Suddenly, you cannot ignore
interactions of s on one side

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
with p on the other.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And so, I am going to draw here
the diagram that you would use,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
say, for N two.
And, for simplicity,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I am just going to draw the
middle part.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
This part here in the middle is
that which corresponds to the

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
molecule.
This one is what you would use

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
for O two or F two.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
And let's just go ahead and
draw that diagram for the

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
molecule.
This one would be this set of

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
energy levels corresponding to,
for example, N two.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And we have increasing energy

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
on the vertical axis.
We are going to find that

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
again, we have a sigma and a
sigma star.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And then, the difference comes
right here where we find that as

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
we go up in energy we next get
to our pi bonds.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And then, the next sigma
orbital is slightly higher in

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
energy than the pi system rather
than slightly lower in energy.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
And then we will encounter up
here our pi star.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
And then, finally,
that highest in energy,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
sigma star.
This switch,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
this sigma going up relative to
that pi is really a consequence

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
of all of the sigma orbitals
being responsive to the value of

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
the electronegativity of the 2s
orbital of the atom.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
You can really almost consider
the pi system independent from

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
the sigma.
These four sigma orbitals,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
sigma, sigma star,
sigma, sigma star,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I can call them one sigma,
two, three, four,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
just to show you that we have,
in ascending order,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
four orbitals of sigma
symmetry.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
That whole manifold,
when you can start mixing a

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
little bit of very low energy s
into it, sinks down relative to

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
pi.
In the case over here,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
we are basically pulling down
the four sigma orbitals relative

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
to pi.
And here, because our s

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
orbitals are higher in energy
relative to our p orbitals,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
they go up a little bit and
bumps three sigma up over pi.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And what it means is that these
orbitals are not so simple

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
anymore.
Any one of them is a linear

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
combination of four atomic
orbitals.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
This orbital here,
one sigma, will not look like

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
it looks in the H two
problem, anymore.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
This one sigma will have some p
mixed into it.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And so, one way we can
represent that through a simple

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
drawing is like this.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
You see the difference between
that sigma bonding orbital and

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
the one up there?
We have some extra little nodes

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
in here that are an inherent
characteristic of the

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
contribution of 2pz orbitals
into this.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
This is a linear combination of
the 2s and the 2pz orbitals on

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
the two atoms we have.
There are four atomic orbitals

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
that go in with different
coefficients to these different

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
parts of the sigma manifold.
And then up here,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
the other bonding orbital,
we can draw it this way.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And this molecular orbital,
this one here,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
three sigma,
has diminished bonding

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
character between the two nuclei
and enhanced character on the

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
outside, the part of the p
orbital that is contributing to

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
it that points away from the
other atom.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And so, while this has bonding
character, it also has what we

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
might think of as lone pair
characteristics.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
In MO theory,
some orbitals are not that

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
simple.
They might be at the same time

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
a little bit bonding and a
little bit lone pair in

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
character.
Let's look at a couple of

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
orbitals like that,
briefly.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And here I have done this for
the C two molecule.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
I have done the calculation for
C two,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
so now we are over here on the
left-hand side of that dividing

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
line where s and p are a big
closer together.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And I am opening up this
orbital, this one down here.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
It is a little more complicated
than the way I drew it on the

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
board, but what you should be
able to see is --

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Think back, now,
to the first orbital I showed

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
you today, which was the lowest
lying orbital in the BH three

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
molecule.
You remember,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
no matter which way we turned
it, we only saw blue,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
which was the positive wave
function.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
It looked like an s orbital,
everywhere.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It had the same sign
everywhere, and you could not

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
see any nodal properties.
Well, that would be true also

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
for this one down here in the
case of O two or F two

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
because it is not mixing
in p character.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Because the atomic s and p
orbitals are so far away in

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
energy.
But now, when they are closer

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
in energy, this orbital down
here, the s over here sees the p

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
over here and they mix in,
and vice versa.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
And, if I turn this around,
what you are going to see are

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
these little negative lobes here
that I am indicating that are

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
mixing in.
But this is hugely bonding

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
orbital, still,
because look at how much of the

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
orbital is centered in the
region between the nuclei.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
This is a very strongly bonding
orbital in this system.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Let's now visualize the three
sigma, the third sigma symmetry

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
orbital, as we ascend in energy.
And it will look hopefully

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
something like what I drew here.
There it is.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
You see this is a sigma
orbital, because as we look down

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
the z-axis, it looks just round.
But it certainly has a lot of p

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
orbital character because as we
go from outside the molecule

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
through the nucleus,
we get a change in sign.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
And then there is overlap in
here, but the amount of the

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
overlap in here is small
compared to the amount of this

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
lobe out here that is just
nonbonding in character because

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
it is pointing out into space.
It is like a lone pair of

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
electrons at the same time as it
is a bonding orbital.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
If this molecule actually had
enough electrons to fill up

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
through three sigma and no
higher, than you would recognize

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
that this orbital that we are
looking at would be the highest

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
occupied molecular orbital.
And it would be responsible for

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
the basicity and the
nucleophilicity of the molecule

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
--
-- because any Lewis acid that

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
came in would want to come in on
the z-axis to interact with this

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
lone pair electron density out
there.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
So, that is how our three sigma
orbital now looks when we are on

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
the left side of that red dotted
line to the lighter elements.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
I will leave that up there for
a moment while we consider a

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
couple of interesting points.
One of the things that you will

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
often be asked to do is to write
down the configuration.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And I want to finish these two
questions here of O two,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
why does it have unpaired
electrons?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
In the case of O two,
we are over on this diagram,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
we have 12 valance electrons.
We can go two,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
four, six, eight,
ten, and then 11 and 12,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
two electrons up here in the pi
star manifold.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
We are completely filled up
through pi.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
And then, we have a half-filled
pi star with 12 electrons

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
populating the O two diagram.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Let's represent that this way.
We have our one sigma with two

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
electrons in.
We have our second sigma,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
which is antibonding with two
electrons.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Then we have our third sigma
with two electrons.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
And then, as we go up in
energy, the next is our first pi

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
orbital bonding.
That accommodates four

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
electrons.
And then we have next our

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
second pi type orbital.
It is antibonding and has two

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
electrons in it.
And then all the other orbitals

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
are empty, so I won't indicate
them.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
This is the configuration for
the O two molecule.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
That means, we come back over
here, by Hund's rule of maximum

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
multiplicity,
we have two spin-up electrons

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
in the O two molecule
with all these other orbitals

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
down here being filled.
That configuration that I wrote

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
down for the O two molecule over
there is a very shorthand way of

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
representing the MO energy level
diagram --

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
-- because I started here at
the lowest energy,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
and I went up in energy like
this.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And what you can see is sigma
star cancels sigma,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
so no bonding there.
We have here three electron

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
pairs in bonding orbitals,
sigma and 2pi,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
but we have two electrons that
are unpaired electrons,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
responsible for the
paramagnetism of the O two

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
molecule,
that cancel some of the bonding

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
down here.
When we want to write that down

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
in terms of our bond order
convention, we have six bonding

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
electrons minus two antibonding
electrons over two,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
which is going to be equal to a
bond order of two.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
That is our bond order for O
two.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
While the bond order is what we
expect to find based on that

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
valance bond representation of O
two up there,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
what we find out is that the
representation of O two up there

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
in the valance bond terminology
would not tell us that the

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
molecule should actually have
two electrons that are not

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
paired in the molecule,
--

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
-- that it should have
paramagnetism due to the lack of

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
pairing up of all the electrons,
spin pairing in the molecule.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
And it has to do with this high
symmetry of the O two molecule.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
And it cannot distort from high

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
symmetry because it has just two
atoms.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
It has very few degrees of
freedom.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
It cannot bend or something to
get those electrons to pair up,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
and so they are unpaired.
And that is why dioxegen has

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
unpaired electrons.
And then, if we go to nitrogen,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
the order that we write these
things down in is a little

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
different because the energy
level diagram is different

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
because now s and p are closer
together.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And what we have is one sigma
with two electrons,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
or two sigma star with two
electrons.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
And then, next,
we have our one pi with its

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
four electrons.
And then next,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
we have our three sigma with
its two electrons.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
And that is it.
We have two less electrons in

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
the system than we do in
O two.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
That is N two.
And our bond order now is

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
three.
That is in accord with our

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Lewis structure of N two,
but it is a triple bond.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And it is a triple bond in a
molecule that is completely

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
non-polar.
And it is one of the strongest

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
chemical bonds known.
That triple bond is worth about

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
226 kilocalories per mole.
And it makes N two a

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
very fascinating molecule.
And, of course,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
it is the major constituent of
our atmosphere.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
And it is very inert,
due to the stability associated

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
with having this diagram
populated up all through the

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
bonding orbitals,
and then no more antibonding

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
electrons present in the system.
So, that is pretty interesting.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
And given the time,
I think I will leave you after

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
the following.
I just want to show you one

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
more picture as a prelude to
where I will start next time.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
And that has to do with what
happens when the two atoms that

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
are bonding are different.
Let's look at the three sigma

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
orbital for the carbon monoxide
molecule.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
It would look like it does for
N two.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
It is the same number of
electrons.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
But look here.
It is very asymmetric.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And that has to do with the
fact that carbon and oxygen have

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
very different
electronegativity.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
And so, this highest occupied
molecular orbital for carbon

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
monoxide, again,
an eight orbital problem,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
and again, a ten electron
system, is one where we have a

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
larger coefficient on the lone
pair piece that is on the carbon

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
atom of the molecule.
And I will start off with this

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
next time, but that is one of
two reasons why CO is a poison.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Have a nice weekend.

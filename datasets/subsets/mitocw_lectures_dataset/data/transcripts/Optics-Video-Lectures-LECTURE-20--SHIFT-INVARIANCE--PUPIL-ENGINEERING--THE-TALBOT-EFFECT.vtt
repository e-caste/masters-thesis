00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:22.290
PROFESSOR: Right, OK.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.690
So I guess we ought to start.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.625
We seem to be a bit depleted.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.210
Anyway, so today last time we
spoke about 4f imaging systems

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.040
and a bit about
spatial filtering.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.890
And I guess we're going to do
quite a lot more on that today,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.150
really.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.780
So I mean this is really the
most basic part of Fourier

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.480
optics, really, I think so you
need to get lots of practice

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.240
seeing how it all works until
it comes second nature really.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.950
So this is what
we said last time.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.760
We went through
this slide last time

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.570
showing the significance
of the point spread

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.210
function of a low pass filter.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.310
The idea is that if you
put in a point object--

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.810
i.e.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.830
You put in an opaque
screen with a small hole

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.750
in, illuminate that with
light, this is going

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
to then give a spherical wave.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.060
And then this lens is going to
collimate that spherical wave

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.910
to make a plane wave.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.680
And in this back focal
plane of that lens,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
you will get a nice
smooth variation here--

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.530
no variation, uniform
intensity, uniform amplitude,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.130
which is basically
the Fourier transform

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.630
of this delta function.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.050
Fourier transform of a delta
function is a constant,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.680
isn't it?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.010
And then this light then
goes through a pupil mask.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.480
The plane wave after the mask
then gets to this second lens.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.390
And the plane wave
is then focused down

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.830
and produces a focused spot
at some image plane, right?

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.050
So that's how it all works.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.800
And so now what do
you actually see here?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.050
What's the image of a
single point object?

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.930
What you see is the Fourier
transform of this pupil mask.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.600
Because again, this is also
producing a Fourier transform.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.140
Right, so the point
spread function--

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.000
what's called the amplitude
point spread function

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
is just the Fourier
transform of this pupil mask.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.390
And we sometimes talk about
an intensity point spread

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.300
function, which is actually the
model of the square of that,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.380
the intensity in that
image of a point object.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.010
OK, so and this is
reminding you where

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.030
you might have come across
this sort of concept before.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.080
This is like-- we spoke
in the last lecture about

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.270
if in electronics,
you might think

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.350
of an electronic system like
an amplifier or something

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.090
as a sort of black box.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.810
You put in a signal, and
you get out a signal.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.730
And you can characterize
that black box

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.850
by what's called the
impulse response, which

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.280
is the response that it would
give to a sharp spike going in.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.580
All right, so ideally
you'd expect--

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.880
you'd want a sharp spike
to come out as well.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.500
But in practice,
you don't get that.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.820
You get some sort
of broader function

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.920
because of the imperfections
of the transfer system.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.250
OK, so this is our
point spread function.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.080
And it's denoted-- little
h of x dash, y dash.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.390
This the x dash y dash plane.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.459
And I guess this
terminology little h

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.440
seems to be pretty universal.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.620
Goodman, I think, uses
that in other places.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.920
All right, so this is
just now describing again

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.460
how you how you
calculate this 4 pi--

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.190
this 4f system.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.310
We notice everywhere that
the input transparency

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.220
of a delta function
gives one here.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.890
You multiply by the
pupil mask, and then you

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.520
do another Fourier
transform to find the image.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.610
All right, so that's--

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.080
I ought to say something bit
more about the scaling of this.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.080
Yeah, so you've got
of course, this.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.798
The output point spread function
is a function of x dashed.

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.340
But, of course, when you do a
Fourier transform of something,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.770
it's going to be a function
of frequency, not of distance,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.760
isn't it?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.890
So really this h
here, h of x dashed,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.400
we get by doing the
Fourier transform of this,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.910
and then transforming
the coordinates-- scaling

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.050
the coordinates in order to get
it into the coordinates x dash.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.450
OK, so and then
last time, we also--

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.640
I'll go through this
very quickly, what

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.570
we said last time, if you've
got a low pass filter in 1D,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:02.870
like a slip pupil, then the
pupil mask is a rect function.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.420
And so if we're trying to
calculate the image of a point

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.890
object again, the field when
it gets to this pupil plane

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.460
is just a constant.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.660
And so after it's gone
through the aperture,

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.390
it will have this sort
of amplitude variation.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.260
And then so this is
what this is showing.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.870
On the positive side is what's
on the negative side, which

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.780
is just 1 times
this, which is this.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.230
And then if you then
Fourier transform that,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.470
you find that the
point spread function

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.812
is going to be the
Fourier transform of this,

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:44.770
which is just the sync.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.540
And then the point
spread function

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.920
is the Fourier
transform of this.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.013
And then this is doing the
scaling of the coordinates

00:07:01.013 --> 00:07:02.680
and getting it into
the right hand side.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.055
I'm not going to
go through that.

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:10.300
We went through it last time,
but hopefully we're going to--

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.220
yeah, here we are.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.580
And there's the sync.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.680
Right, so this is that
the amplitude point

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.010
spread function or just normally
called point spread function.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.670
Note that it goes negative.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.060
This is 0 here.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.180
So note that it goes
negative, right.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.260
So you've got to convolve
that with your objects

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.140
to find the image of some
arbitrary objects, which we'll

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.750
carry on to talk
about in a minute.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.580
This was just another
example of a phase filter

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.260
and the Fourier
transform of that.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.635
But I don't think there's
point going through that again.

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:47.470
We'll just carry on now
where we've got up too,

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.520
which was to do with shift
invariance of the 4f system.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.570
Now what we find--

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.170
what we've looked at is if we've
got a point object that we get

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.840
from this hole in
the screen, we get

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.080
an image which is this
amplitude point spread function.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.360
The amplitude here would
be this Fourier transform

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.470
of this pupil mask.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.370
Then, yeah I'd just mention,
there is this constant.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.810
This is the point
spread function.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:21.080
It's the Fourier transform
of this pupil mass.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.840
But there's this constant
out at the front.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.370
And this constant out at the
front is written like this.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.940
And you can see that it's
made up of two parts.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.890
First of all, this phase part--

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.700
this just comes about
because of the distance

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.429
the wave is traveled
through the optical system.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.789
Right, so if it starts
off with zero phase here,

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.660
it's going to come up with
some particular finite phase

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.940
when it travels all this
distance through the system.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.070
And then the other
bet is this F2

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.420
over F1, which is
a scaling factor,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.030
the ratio of the focal lengths.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:08.365
And basically you need that to
satisfy conservation of energy.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:14.030
All right, so you can imagine
that as the point spread

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:19.100
function gets broader, then
it has to also get lower

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.880
because it has to contain
the right amount of energy

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.620
equal to the energy
going into the system.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.670
So when you work
out the intensity

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.410
of this image of a
point, this would

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.880
be F2 over F1 squared, which
is the ratio of the heights--

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.200
the maximum intensities
of the center

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.420
of that image of a point.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.820
Right, now so what we'll be
carrying on to look at now

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.040
is what happens if we
displace our point object.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.850
We move this delta
function sideways.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.600
And then let's
look, first of all,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.150
at just the physical
situation of what's happening.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.700
This produces a spherical wave.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.400
And then when it goes
through the lens,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.030
you can see that it's going
to produce again-- it's

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.770
going to be collimated
into a plane wave.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:16.040
But now this plane wave is not
actually moving horizontally

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.200
but is moving at an angle.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.920
And this comes about because
when you Fourier transform

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.990
this, you will get some
exponential phase factor, which

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.400
actually represents a wave
which is moving at an angle.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.060
And then when this
inclined plane wave

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.920
goes through the
pupil mask, of course,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.870
its angle doesn't
change anymore.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.270
So it's still moving
at the same angle here.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.640
And then again, it's collimated
and produces an image.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.900
And the image-- what we find--

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.990
is the same as it was before.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.540
The amplitude is exactly
the same as it was before.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.350
But it's shifted.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.800
So this is what we found before
when we looked at the image.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.200
You got this-- you remember--
this inverted magnified image.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.470
The inversion means that it's
the opposite side of the axis.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.200
The scaling is this F2 over F1,
which comes about from the fact

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.130
that the focal
lengths are not equal.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.500
But the important
thing to notice

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.790
is that apart from this shift,
this function is the same

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.950
as the function was before.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.140
So what that means
is that this is

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.450
what's called shift invariance.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.790
It means that the
image of a point

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.430
is independent of
where the point is.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.510
Right, so that's a very
important property, which

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.640
simplifies things tremendously.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.810
Yeah, and here's
a note just to say

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.370
that that is the lateral
magnification of this system

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.460
as we described before.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:15.560
OK, so now this is just
showing this diagram again.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.570
These are not meant
as sort of rays.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.140
These are just sort of showing
regions where the light is

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.270
as it goes through.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:31.890
But we've got this
amplitude here,

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.230
which is Fourier
transformed by a lens

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.726
and then goes through a mask,
Fourier transformed again

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:40.600
[AUDIO OUT] field.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.120
So what this slide
is trying to show

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.020
is the significance of
the point spread function.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.030
At some arbitrary objects--

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.060
we can think of an
arbitrary object g of t,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.250
an arbitrary transparency.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.750
You can you can think of--

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:03.840
sorry.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.930
You're illuminating
that with some field.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.990
So what actually you get
after the transparency

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.610
is the products of those two.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.110
So is the g in that I
really meant to talk about.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.940
The g in you can think
of as being made up

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.680
of lots of delta functions.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.830
Any arbitrary function,
you can divide it up

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.280
into lots of delta
functions where

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.160
the strength of each of them
corresponds to the strength

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.938
of that function at that point.

00:13:30.938 --> 00:13:32.730
Right, so this is what
this expression here

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.210
is writing down.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.970
So the g in is written as--

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.720
you can write it as an
integral over delta functions

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.415
with the strength
given by the function.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.890
But each of those
delta functions

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.170
is going to propagate
through this system

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.840
and produce a point
spread function exactly

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.430
like we described before.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.120
And then the image
of the total object

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.300
is going to be the sum
of the images of all

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.990
these delta functions.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.960
So all of these delta functions
produce point spread functions.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.930
So you integrate over those
point spread functions

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.070
with the relative strengths
that you need from here

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.580
and you'll get the final image.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.600
And yeah, you can
see that this is

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.600
a bit like Huygens principle,
that you are breaking up

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.560
this wavefront into lots
of components that are all

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.300
represented as delta functions.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:52.630
OK, so therefore what we get out
is going to be this integral.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.050
Each of these delta
functions is going

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.530
to produce an image given by
this point spread function.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:04.150
The point spread function
is shifted a distance

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.830
which depends on the
original distance

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.240
but is scaled according
to this factor we just

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.080
mentioned earlier.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.560
And the strength
of that component

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.740
is given by this value g in at
this point as we said there.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.230
So our final expression says
that the output amplitude,

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.160
but amplitude convolved with
the point spread function.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.360
Right, so this
expression-- you can see--

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.140
is exactly the same as
an ordinary convolution

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:45.460
expression, except [AUDIO OUT]
But you can see it's

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:55.730
like [AUDIO OUT]

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:01.060
OK, yeah so because
of this scaling,

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.060
we can-- and also the
inversion as well,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.110
we sometimes express
things in terms

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.680
of a reduced optical
output coordinates.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.230
So we think of the
output coordinate

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.990
as being [? measured ?]
[AUDIO OUT] to get rid

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.560
of the sine and also
scaled it to get rid

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.510
of the scaling factor.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:31.450
And if we do it in terms of
these reduced quantities,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.300
then you can write this as
are just a normal convolution

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:34.830
expression.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.240
So all we've done
really is scaled

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.750
the output coordinates
in order to make it

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:46.350
so that you can use the
normal convolution expression.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.280
And then we think
back to our case

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.270
I was mentioning before of
the electronic black box.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.530
So an electronic black
box, you can either

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.310
characterize in terms
of an impulse function

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.800
or in terms of a
transfer function.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.020
So an impulse
function-- you look

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.890
at a delta function in time
and look at what comes out.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.500
In terms of a transfer function,
you put in a pure frequency

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.230
and you look at
the output that you

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.630
get from that pure frequency.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:26.550
Right, so we can do exactly
the same for the optical case,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.180
instead of thinking in terms of
a point spread function, which

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:39.830
is the same as this
impulse response,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.740
we can think in terms
of a transfer function.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.310
And now one thing
to be very clear

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.070
here is of course,
this whole thing,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.100
we're talking about
coherent systems.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.560
So we're working with
amplitudes all the time.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.600
And so it's the
amplitudes that are

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.500
going to be affected
by the optical system.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.860
And that's why we have
to think of what's called

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.750
an amplitude transfer function.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.550
All right, and we've written
that as ATF, amplitude transfer

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.430
function.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.490
So this-- if you do
have just a Fourier

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.750
transform of this convolution,
you get a product.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.360
And so this is saying
that the spectrum out--

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.340
the spatial frequency
content of the image

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.770
is equal to the
spatial frequency

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.390
content of the input
multiplied by some transfer

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:44.300
function, which is the Fourier
transform of the point spread

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.870
function.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.140
Right, so this thing here is
called our amplitude transfer

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.140
function.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:56.370
So we have to multiply the
spectral content of the object

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.290
by the transfer function.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.350
And then we could do an
inverse Fourier transfer

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.400
and we'd end up
now with the image,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.690
the amplitude in the image.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.685
That there's something.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.680
It wrote something, did it?

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.318
Yeah, OK.

00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:24.110
Right, so we've already
[? reached ?] that.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.670
OK, so let's look at these
examples we said again.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.170
So these are two pupil masks
that we looked at before.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.890
The first one is just
a low pass filter,

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.120
lets through the low
spatial frequencies

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.760
but doesn't let through the
high spatial frequencies.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.880
And this was another--
this was a phase

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.240
filter we looked at
before where we only

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.400
let through the spatial
frequencies within this region.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.990
But also within that region,
we changed the phase--

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.040
the relative phase
of the components

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.660
which are in this region here.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.120
Right, so you can
think of this as being

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.567
the modulus of the filter.

00:20:11.567 --> 00:20:12.900
This is the phase of the filter.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.380
And outside here, of
course, it's zero anyway.

00:20:23.668 --> 00:20:31.670
So [AUDIO OUT]
Right and then, this

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:38.720
is how we calculate the
transfer function from this.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.430
This is a distance, right?

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.610
The pupil is actually
a real physical thing.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.470
So it's got a physical size.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.900
So this is measured
in centimeters here.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.030
It cuts off at 1.5 centimeters.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.010
And in order to convert
that into spatial frequency,

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.700
we have to divide
that by lambda f.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.350
And this is putting
in some figures.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:07.010
That says that u is equal to
x double dash in centimeters

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.810
times 10 to the
minus 3 centimeters

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:19.370
to the minus [AUDIO OUT]
[? Scaling ?] of our transfer

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:25.040
function, and then finally
this is what the ATF is.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.714
5 is going to be 1.5
times 10 to the 3 cent--

00:21:34.714 --> 00:21:38.740
[AUDIO OUT] which is what this
shows here in this diagram.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.015
It's identical, just scaled.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.020
Of course, to the
other example--

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:56.237
or any [AUDIO OUT]
[INAUDIBLE] [AUDIO OUT]

00:21:56.237 --> 00:21:57.070
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.190
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE] is going
to have this modulus of phase

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.930
components.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:01.690
Yeah?

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.060
AUDIENCE: Your sound is
breaking up a little bit.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.830
And I wanted to ask how is the
point spread function related

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.610
to ATF?

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.130
Is it just the--

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.360
ATF is the Fourier transform
of the point spread function.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they're
a Fourier transform pair.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.925
Yeah, but you have to be
careful with the scalings.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.790
OK, so I don't
know why the sound.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.290
I moved that a bit closer.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:31.920
Is it?

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.850
TA: Maybe clip it
on the other side.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.975
PROFESSOR: I'll clip it on
the other side, perhaps.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.990
Right, OK.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.770
Let's see if that's better.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:43.900
Maybe just walking around.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.910
OK, so that's that one finished.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.010
Where am I going to
find something, George?

00:22:53.010 --> 00:23:12.060
TA: [INAUDIBLE] That's proper.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.770
PROFESSOR: OK, so now
we're up to today.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.530
OK, so really today we're
going to carry on talking

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.880
about the same sort of stuff.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.850
I think this is the
simplest way to describe it.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.240
And so what we've
been looking at-- this

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.760
is just revising
again with the fact

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.640
that we're thinking
of the 4f system

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.090
as being a linear
shifting variance system.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:45.190
Right, so if you remember
the shift invariance means

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:50.210
that the point spread function
is independent of position?

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:56.590
Right, so there in that case,
you can [? right ?] the image

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.850
as a convolution.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.900
Yeah?

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:11.780
AUDIENCE: Mr. [INAUDIBLE]
There's [? nothing ?] with

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:19.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.500
So I hope that this is better.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:31.040
So we can take about a 4f
system as being an linear shift

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.580
invariant imaging system.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:40.080
And so this is
going through then

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.790
how you calculate
that sort of system.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.720
So we start off with
some illuminating field

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.860
that comes in here.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.510
It illuminates
some transparency.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.890
And so what you get on
the far side of that

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:56.220
is going to be the
product of illumination

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.420
and the transparency.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.650
All right, so this is
basically the object

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.480
of the imaging system,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.070
And then it goes through
an imaging system

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.410
with a certain pupil
mask, which is related

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.280
to an amplitude
transfer function, which

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:27.780
is just a scaled version
of that pupil mask.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:33.150
And by doing the Fourier
transform of that,

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.650
you will get the point spread
function of the system.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:42.280
So the Fourier transform
of the pupil mask

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.160
gives this point spread
function like this.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.380
And then your output
field is going

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:01.840
to be your input field
convolved with the point spread

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.750
function of the system.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.920
So I noticed that--

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.030
so there are two versions of
this that are described here,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.000
one in terms of x dashed,
and one in terms of x naught

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.130
dashed.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:23.980
This x naught dashed
one is the rescaled one

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.480
to make it look like
a proper convolution.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.170
So we've got rid of the
scaling factor F2 over F1.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.000
And you see what
that does back here

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.840
in the point spread function
is it just changes an F2--

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.950
well, one over F2
to one over F1.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.562
So you can work in
either of those.

00:26:46.562 --> 00:26:47.770
There's no difference really.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.640
OK, so let's now think about
how these concepts fit in

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.950
with what we learn from
geometrical optics.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.290
And first of all, then we
look at natural magnification.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:12.480
What we find then is that if
we have a point object here--

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.700
we just mentioned this before--

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.920
what it would give
is an image which

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.840
is going to be a blurred
image of a point object.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.090
It's going to be this amplitude
point spread function.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.270
But let's for the moment--

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.220
we're trying to find
out how this fits in

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.740
with the geometric optics limit.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.950
Of course, in geometrical
optics there is no diffraction.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.650
So you can look at the
sort of limiting case

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.450
as when that point
spread function becomes

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.960
a delta function.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.710
So in this case,
this is not physical

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.450
because you couldn't do
this either very easily.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.540
But you could do it only
by making the wavelength 10

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.050
to zero or you could
make the aperture 10

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.840
to infinity, which of
course, both things

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.610
you can't really do.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.000
But just think of it like this
just to see what's going on.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.790
If you could think of
the point spread function

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.940
as being a delta function,
the image of our point

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.720
here would be a point here.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.940
And we've already found
where that point is.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.640
We've found that
it's a point which

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.160
is on the opposite
side of the axis.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.140
And the distance here is
scaled relative to this one

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.880
by the ratio of
the focal lengths.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:37.680
And this is exactly what we
found from geometrical optics.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.620
So the lateral magnification
is this n here.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.440
nt is the lateral
magnification which

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:52.410
is given by minus the ratio of
the focal length in F2 over F1.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.600
OK, so if we assume that
our amplitude point spread

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.210
function is just
a delta function,

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.200
then the output
amplitude is going

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.060
to be equal to the
input amplitude

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.160
but with this scaling.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.540
OK, so that's the result we get.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.895
It's exactly the same as you
get from geometrical optics.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.790
Analyzing the same system
would also give you

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.220
this same magnification.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.890
Right, so this is
another example.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.820
This is looking at the angular
magnification of this system.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.980
So before we looked
at what happens

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.770
for a point in the input plane.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.400
Now we're going to look at
what happens to a plane wave

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.030
at a certain angle
in the input plane.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.090
And you can see what that plane
wave does as it goes through.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.420
Of course, the plane wave when
it's Fourier transformed now

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.380
becomes a converging wave,
which converges on this point.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.310
It then spreads
again and then is

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.840
coming is collimated
by this lens

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:25.210
to produce an another
parallel wave there.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.500
But you'll notice that
the angle of this wave

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.250
is not the same as the
angle of this wave.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.230
For a start, you'll notice
they've got opposite signs.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.460
That one's going up.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.080
That one's coming down.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.660
But that's what you'd
expect of course, because

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.810
of this same inversion that
we've been talking about.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:50.130
So this input field then is
just an exponential face factor.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.680
OK, so still assuming this
ideal geometrical point spread

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.750
function, the output field
is going to be given by this.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.990
And you can then express
that in terms of phases.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.310
And it comes out to be this.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.660
So this is the angle--

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.240
the angle in was 3 to 1 and
the angle out is now minus F1

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.200
over F2 times 3 to 1.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.030
So again, it's scaled and
got an inversion relative

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.920
to the input angle.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.550
So you can see the
angle of magnification

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:40.720
then is given by this
expression, minus F1 over F2.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.170
And again, that is
the same as you get

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.690
from your geometrical optics.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.710
OK, so based on the
interpretation of propagation

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.520
of spatial frequency,
the magnification results

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.030
are also in agreement with
the scaling similarity

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.520
theorem of Fourier transforms.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.410
Right, so you've got
an input amplitude,

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:14.570
an output amplitude related to
an input amplitude, an output

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:20.000
spatial frequency related to
an input spatial frequency.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.850
And you notice this
one's got an F1 over F2.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.940
And this one's
got an F2 over F1.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.220
So this is back to where
idea is that if you make

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.640
the functions smaller,
the Fourier transform is

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.110
broader and vise versa.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.240
OK, so now this geometry
I guess you could see--

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.570
maybe I could just draw one.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.800
So this is our system.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.930
And what I was going
to draw, this is F1.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.110
F1, F1, F2, F2.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:08.040
And you can see this wave
is coming in like this.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.430
So we could have
drawn a ray like this.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:21.440
And this would of course, have
been refracted so that it's

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.400
traveling parallel to the axis.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.890
And then this would
come down like that.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.640
So you can see here,
this is our phase one.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.130
So f phase one is this distance.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.060
And that is also--

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.390
if you think of this
as being theta out,

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:41.370
we can see that this distance
is the same as this distance.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:46.180
And so F2 times theta out is
equal to F1 times theta in.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.900
OK, so everything agrees
nicely with geometrical optics.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.760
So that's good.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.110
So let's look at
some examples now.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.650
Let's look at some
examples of some apertures.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:08.500
So first of all, the case of
let's put it as our pupil mask

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.960
a rectangular aperture, which
has got a distance a and b

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.520
in the two directions.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.869
So we can think of this as being
rect, x over a times directive

00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:21.260
rect of y over b.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:26.880
And we can then work out what
the transfer function of that

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.570
is.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.280
The transfer
function-- we said--

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.710
is just equal to a scaled
version of the pupil mask.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.969
So if this is a rectangle,
this is also a rectangle.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:45.400
But the scaling has got
this lambda F1 coming in.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.074
Right, so this is now--

00:34:47.074 --> 00:34:48.449
because it has to
have something.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.695
This is a function of distance.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.960
Sorry, x is distance.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.070
a is distance.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.640
Right, so this is the
dimension and its quantity.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.580
And in here, this is distance.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.960
This is distance.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.740
And this is distance.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.600
So this has to be, of course,
inverse distance, doesn't it--

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.730
to make this whole
thing dimensionless.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:20.090
So this is why you need
to have something in there

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.680
to get it the right dimensions.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.410
And then the point
spread function

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.950
is given by the Fourier
transform of that.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.630
And that's what this looks like.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.440
Fourier transform
of rect is sinc.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.290
So this is separable.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:38.180
So you just do the two
Fourier transforms separately.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.830
And you end up with this
pattern that you've seen before.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:48.980
It looks like a central spot
and then a lot of extra spots

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.390
that decrease in
amplitude or intensity

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.050
as you get away from that.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.170
Yeah?

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.970
TA: Maybe we mentioned
that in the notes

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.510
that they posted the ATF
and PSF were mislabeled.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.680
In the notes that
were on the web,

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.480
this said PSF and this said ATF.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.970
So it's pretty obvious
when you see them.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:15.470
It's obviously the
wrong way around.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.500
TA: And we posted corrections.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.050
[? George ?] posted
a correction.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.930
Now I was going to
ask one question.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.810
This is presumably the intensity
of the point spread function

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.500
that your plotting here--

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.788
TA: Is the square.

00:36:29.788 --> 00:36:30.830
PROFESSOR: Is the square.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.470
Yeah, the square of the
amplitude point spread

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.960
function.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.330
Right, So that's our first
example, very important

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.950
example.

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:43.320
The second one is probably
even more important.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.350
So this is a circular aperture.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.780
And of course, most
optical systems

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.770
do have circular apertures.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.950
So this is why this is
of great importance.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.420
It seems to have
turned out being

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.160
bit like American football for
some reason, but never mind.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.510
And practice because it's going
to over to the US, I suppose.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.760
TA: This would have been
OK except the perception

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.250
[INAUDIBLE] the
other way around.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.310
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.150
That's true.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.160
Yes.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.740
It doesn't know how to do
Fourier transforms obviously.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.860
Anyway, this is
supposed to be a circle.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.070
And if this is the
pupil mask, the transfer

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.190
function-- the amplitude
transfer function is just

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.200
a scaled version of this.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.320
So it's again just
a circular thing.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.250
And sorry, perhaps I just
ought to stress this.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.130
It's obvious to you now,
I'm sure, by this stage.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.120
So this is plotted
here as black or white.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.690
Of course, white means one--
black means zero in this case.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:52.520
So that means if spatial
frequencies land on this, those

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.340
inside this get through
and those outside this

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.540
don't get through, right?

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.830
So this is what we have
to multiply our frequency

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.770
response of our object by in
order to get the frequency

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.370
response of the image.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.530
And that's just like before.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:15.380
We have to scale this
with these lambda F1s.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.560
And then the Fourier
transform of this

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.990
will give the point
spread function.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:26.070
And this one has now gone
into glorious technicolor.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:30.110
And so this is what
we call the airy disc.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.530
The equation for best is given
in terms of Bessel functions.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.930
You've defined this at
some point, I presume.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.110
I'm not sure I was in the
lecture where we defined

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:43.700
this [INAUDIBLE] function, which
is basically 2j 1 of something

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.460
over something.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.910
And so this is our
normal airy disc,

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.410
the image of a
point object, which

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.560
has got this central
bright spot, and then

00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:02.120
a dark ring, and then some
bright rings outside a not so

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.230
bright ring, and then another
dark ring, and so on and so on.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:10.790
All right, so what
we find then is

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:17.600
the size of this has got this
magic factor 1.22 that comes up

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.290
all the time in terms of when
you look at Rayleigh resolution

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.470
and things, you always
get this magic factor,

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:30.930
which is actually 3.83 which
is the first zero of J1 divided

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:34.490
by pi it turns out.

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.290
So that's why you get
this magic figure.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.470
OK, and this is just to
remind you of course,

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.980
when it comes to
resolution, we've

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.380
mentioned before
how resolution is

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.180
related to numerical aperture.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.430
And so what we're doing
here is producing an image

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.810
of an object, aren't we?

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.320
So if we've got an
object, it's imaged

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.100
with this lens, which has got
a certain numerical aperture.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.230
Right, so this
aperture here is what

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.380
decides the resolution
of the image

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.810
that you will get
in this system.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.020
This aperture here,
you see is a ray that

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:21.050
was drawn so it goes to the
edge of this pupil mask.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.650
And if you trace
this strobe, you'll

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.230
see that it comes
back down here.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.590
Sorry, of course, the numerical
aperture is actually--

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.750
the sine of this
angle, if you remember.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.790
That's what this means.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.270
It's not the angle itself.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.000
NA is not the angle.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.050
NA is equal to N sine
alpha, if you remember.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.540
The refractive index
of the material

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.310
times the sine of this angle.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:53.530
But what we find is that
if F1 and F2 are not equal,

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.240
this angle here,
of course, is not

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.720
going to be equal to this one.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.830
You can see that if NA
is small, if NA is small,

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.840
you can see that
these are going to be

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.970
scaled in the same way
as your F1 and your F2.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.970
It [INAUDIBLE] exactly be that.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:26.160
Of course, this NA would
have to be the tan of that.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.940
But the sine-- if NA is
small, then this distance

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.310
is the same here and here.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:38.890
So this distance
over this distance

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:44.310
divided by this distance
over this distance

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.500
is pretty close to being the
ratio of the focal length.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:58.220
OK, so we've got a certain
NA on the input side.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.110
And we've got a certain
NA on the output side.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:05.090
And the ratio
between those names

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:10.690
is just equal to the
magnification of the system.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:14.290
So actually, of course,
we're well used to the fact

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:22.760
that rays of light go equally
well in both directions.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.990
So we could use this
same ray diagram

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:30.890
to look at what happens
if this was the object

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.620
and this was the image.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.180
But in this case, of course, all
these things are now inverted.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.540
So if it was producing--

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.750
as it stands here, it's
producing a demagnified image

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:44.800
in this way.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.400
So it would produce a
magnified image going this way.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.300
And so you see that the object
that you'd have to be imaging

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.840
is scaled relative to this one.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.310
So the resolution would
be the same basically

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.540
in two directions.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.560
I mean, sorry--
that's not quite true.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.730
What am I trying to say?

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:11.530
I'm trying to say that the
NA relative to the size

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.080
of our object that
we're imaging here

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.840
will be the same when
we think of it as going

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.820
this way or that way,
because in real terms, how

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:26.380
small a thing you can actually
see with an optical system

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.380
depends on the numerical
aperture of the lens

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.700
that you're looking at with,
not the lens at the far end.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.590
OK, and then for
our slit aperture,

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.170
this is what the point
spread function looks like.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:52.350
And then you can express
that then very simply just

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.800
replacing our a over F1
by numerical aperture,

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.550
we've got now that
the width at this spot

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.770
is given by lambda
over NA, which

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.920
is exactly what we came about--

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.015
I guess you said that
before somewhere.

00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:09.890
TA: I can't remember.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.330
PROFESSOR: But the
resolution of a microscope

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.690
or whatever and of
an imaging system,

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.040
you can write in this form.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.190
So of course, this
distance will be

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.890
smallest when this is biggest.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:30.510
So the biggest this
could be is if NA was one

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:34.620
and you made n, the
refractive index nice and big.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.290
And this one, these
distances are in terms--

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.690
this is distance in
the image in terms

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:47.570
of the NA in the output plane.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.990
So you could have
converted this so this

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.150
is distance in the objects.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:58.930
And then this would become
NA in the input plane.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:04.060
And right and then
circular aperture,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.070
our point spread
function looks like this.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.090
And so this is what we get.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:15.790
And this delta r dashed here
given by this expression,

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:22.000
this 0.61 is half of
the 1.22 we had before.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.170
But notice this
is delta r dashed

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.980
is the radius of
the PSF [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.260
So it's this distance,
not the whole distance.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.940
It's this distance, right?

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.170
So this is why we got half--

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:44.950
why the 1.22 is divided by 2.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:45.510
OK.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:49.740
Now I didn't mislead you
also by saying from now

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.220
to the end of the lecture's
a breeze because it

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.730
isn't, because the next bit
is this thing about sampling.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:03.450
So that one more bit which is
a bit difficult to take in.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:08.640
And this is really pointing out
about effectively the number

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.110
of degrees of
freedom in an image.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:17.370
So imagine first of all,
you've got an object

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.660
that you're imaging.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.460
So this is this input field.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.140
It's got a certain size
which is called here delta x.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.660
And of course, in any
real practical systems,

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.800
you don't actually measure
it as a continuous function.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.570
It's actually going
to be measured

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.830
with a certain pixel size.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:39.350
So here we're calling
the pixel size delta x.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.860
Right, now so what
we've got here then

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:48.320
is this function is
like an array of spikes

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.150
in this direction.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:53.270
An array of spikes delta
functions in this direction,

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.060
isn't it--

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.460
so in the products of those.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:01.120
And if you do the Fourier
transform of that,

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.890
you'll get something which is
very similar again an array

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:05.390
of spikes.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:12.440
If you look in the standard
books on Fourier transforms

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.940
like Bracewell or whatever,
he calls this a cone function.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.970
And the Fourier transform
of a cone function

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.130
is another cone function.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:27.650
Right, so this is a cone array
of delta functions multiplied

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.820
by a rectangle.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:33.140
And the Fourier
transform of a product

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:37.580
is the convolution of
the Fourier transforms.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:42.900
Right, so the Fourier transform
of the rect is actually--

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.570
so this is really--

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:46.880
I ought to get into that.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.970
So just think of this then as
being in the spatial frequency

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:51.960
domain.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.220
It's got a certain range
of spatial frequencies,

00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:04.600
and it's made up of certain
resolution of frequencies.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.030
So what we're going to say is
something about Nyquist now.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.870
So we can say that--

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:18.920
we know that in order to image
this input field, knowing

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.430
what this bandwidth
is here, we have

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:26.000
to sample with this distance.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.940
Is that what I'm trying to say?

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.640
Yeah.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.610
The bandwidth is equal to 1 over
twice the sampling distance.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.770
That's right.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.280
Yeah, and this is
in the x direction.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.220
This is in the y direction.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.810
But we can also--

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:52.550
you can see by the similarity
of these diagrams and the fact

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.760
that Fourier transforms
go either way,

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.790
you can see that there will be
a similar sort of Nyquist type

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:02.900
criterion going from
the other way around.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.670
So because this has
got a finite field,

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.410
this would mean that you've
got a certain frequency

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:10.400
resolution there.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.990
So there's a relationship
between delta u and delta x.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.930
The fact that this
has got a 2 here,

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.140
of course, you know from the
normal definition of Nyquist.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.530
And the fact that this
one doesn't have a 2 in,

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.400
it just comes
about from the fact

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:31.350
that this is defined here
as being two times this.

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:39.210
And right, so just like before,
the spatial frequency domain--

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.400
those spatial
frequencies are then

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.480
multiplied by the pupil mask
to find the spatial frequencies

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.000
in the image, aren't they?

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.220
Right, so this is looking now
in the plane of the pupil mask.

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.200
So this is actually the same
as equal to this but just

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.270
with a rescaling.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:03.120
And so these are the
expressions for that.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.750
So this is just applying that
rescaling, putting these lambda

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.810
F1s in these expressions.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.080
So you'll get then
what you need,

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:20.120
how you need to sample
in this plane here.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:27.880
And what you can notice
from that is if you

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.950
you'll notice that these
things are all equal and equal

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.890
to some constant, therefore.

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:40.270
And this thing is called
the Space bandwidth product.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.040
So you look at what this means.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.450
Delta x over delta
x is the field size

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:49.690
divided by the pixel size.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:55.360
So it's basically the number of
pixels in the field, isn't it?

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.200
Right, so your
original object here

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:05.335
has got the number of pixels
equal to n x times n y.

00:51:05.335 --> 00:51:09.850
So that's the total amount
of the number of pixels.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:13.750
And therefore if you think of
it as being a binary thing,

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.730
it's the amount of
information that you've

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:19.300
got in that original object.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.150
And of course,
that information is

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:28.700
going to be transferred
through the system.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:33.610
So if you look at now the ratio
in the next plane in terms

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:38.590
of use, this distance
over this distance

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:41.170
is equal to again,
the number of pixels.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:46.720
And as you know, when you
do a fast Fourier transform

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.430
of something which
has got n elements,

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.020
you get something
which is n elements.

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.720
So it all works right.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:58.240
So effectively, you can think
of this as being a bit like--

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.430
of course, you can't really--

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:04.600
if this has actually got
some finite bandwidth, then

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.750
of course you can't
sample on points.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:11.560
So it's a bit of an idealization
to thinking this for the terms

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.800
really.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.270
But nevertheless, it
gives you a good idea.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:20.950
So of course, for a repetitive
type function like this,

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.190
also you can think in
terms of a Fourier series

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.870
becomes a Fourier transfer.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:28.990
Right, so all we're
doing here is really

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:35.350
resolving our function
here into a Fourier series.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.390
And the Fourier series consists
of a lot of sine terms,

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.890
doesn't it?

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:47.290
Sine of n, and sine
of x, and sine of 2x,

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:52.390
and so on and so on, and these
correspond in the Fourier

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:55.210
domain to these
points on this grid.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:58.390
Right, so these
each of these points

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:03.970
represents the particular
Fourier series component

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:08.050
in the original object if
you think of it like that.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:11.080
So the idea of a space
bandwidth product

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.270
is quite a powerful
way of thinking

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:18.670
about the fundamental
limits of an optical system.

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:24.920
And people have gone on to
study this sort of approach

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.520
in much more detail,
actually trying

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.790
to get around the limitations
that I just described.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:35.450
The fact that, of course,
that we've truncated this

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.980
means that this is no longer
a repetitive function.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.030
And similarly for here, right?

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:44.060
So that actually you know
this idea of thinking

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.780
of truncated
repetitive functions

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.330
is a bit of a anomaly, really.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:54.530
But people have come up
with mathematical ways

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:58.700
of dealing with these sorts
of systems which are probably

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.170
way beyond what we are going
to get to in this course.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.360
OK, did something come up then?

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.080
Oh, yeah.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.510
Next slide.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:13.120
So OK, this is just
pointing out then

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.370
we said that you
put a mask in here

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:22.850
and that mask produces a
certain transfer function--

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:27.130
amplitude transfer function, and
the Fourier transform of that

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.000
gives the pupil function.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.610
And we've shown a
couple of examples

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:33.700
of what this pupil
function looks like

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.130
and what the image
would look like.

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.670
But this is just pointing
out that actually,

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:45.710
of course, that means that
we can choose whatever

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:50.340
we want to put in there in order
to produce the results we want.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.580
So this is what
George has called here

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.600
pupil engineering, which Ernst
Stelzer doesn't believe in,

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.140
I think, from what
we were saying.

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:04.790
But anyway, so the idea is
that by changing this mask,

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:11.150
you can improve the properties
of that point spread function

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:16.610
in some way, which would suit
the that particular application

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:17.540
you're looking at.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:22.220
Actually, it turns out
that you can't actually

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.670
do a lot better normally
than the very simple example

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.040
of a circular aperture.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:35.960
And the circular aperture
is actually very special

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:40.910
because it does give according
to some measures anyway, a very

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.650
sharp point spread function.

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:47.870
And you can come up with
other pupil functions

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:51.560
that make the central lobe
narrower, but normally

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:56.660
what happens is then the size
of the side lobes get stronger.

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:58.200
So it's a sort of compromise.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.180
You can't have a very
small central lobe together

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.540
with very weak side lobes.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.590
OK, so some examples then.

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:13.200
So let's imagine first
of all, our object

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.170
is our intensity
at the input plane

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:21.360
is this rectangle with
the stripy pattern.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.330
And so we're going
to then look at what

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:31.050
happens if we image that with
some mask that we put in here.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:33.150
And what should we
put in there, then?

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:38.530
Well, the first one let's
put in something like this.

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:40.290
So now this is going
to let through--

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:42.690
this is a low pass
filter, isn't it?

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.870
Right, so it's a very small
low pass filter as well.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:50.220
So it only lets through the
very slowly varying parts

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.570
of that object.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:57.090
But it stops all the fast
variations of the object.

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:58.930
Right, so if you
look at the object,

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:02.130
you'll see that it's got
this stripy pattern, which is

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.800
actually a very fine structure.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.530
So these are
actually really being

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:13.250
calculated using Mat lab,
not by me, by George.

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:17.150
And so this is what you'd see
in the output plane of that.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.110
So there you are.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:21.260
You can see that
this stripy pattern

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.720
has disappeared virtually.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.960
We've lost some
sharpness at the edge

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:32.630
though because we've also lost
the high spatial frequencies,

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:34.880
of course, that
defined the edge.

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.680
And a sharp cut off at the
edge will include quite a lot

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.090
of high spatial frequencies.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:47.830
But anyway, so that's a good
example of spatial filtering.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.880
And then the next
ones we're going

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:54.070
to look at something which
has got a bit more structure.

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:59.500
And so this is MIT
written as a binary mask.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.210
And so this is our
original object.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.800
And we're going to image
that in an optical system

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.230
and look at what the image
looks like in different cases.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:12.650
So the first one is
quite straightforward.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:18.820
We've got now a
circular aperture.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.770
So this is what the image
looks like in this case.

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:29.780
You see that there's already a
bit of artifacts in that image.

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:33.850
It's no longer-- you can
still read it as MIT,

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:36.963
but you see that
inside the letters,

00:58:36.963 --> 00:58:38.630
you'll see there's
some structure there,

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:40.810
which is not really present.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:44.020
So this is some sort of edge
ringing, I guess from the fact

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.680
that this aperture has
got this sharp cut off

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.180
at some particular
spatial frequency.

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.420
So if you made it so that
it tailed off gradually,

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.930
you could probably get
rid of some of that--

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:01.300
those fringes there.

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.580
But OK, so that's an aperture.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.550
So we've got rid of some
high spatial frequencies.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:13.900
Let's look what happens if we
reduce the spatial frequencies

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.520
even more.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.290
So this is making
the aperture smaller.

00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:23.070
And now you can see that
the resolution has degraded.

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:27.010
It looks rather blurry now.

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:29.020
You can you can't
really see whether it

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:33.670
says MIT of HIT or maybe HIY.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:36.930
It's all getting a
bit vague, isn't it?

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:41.430
And also you can see that
it gets a bit sort of blurry

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:43.060
around the edges.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.118
Yeah, sorry if we make that--

00:59:45.118 --> 00:59:45.910
AUDIENCE: Question?

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:48.770
One thing to point out here
which is kind of obvious,

00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:51.820
but it's worth pointing is
that if you do this also,

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.220
the average brightness
of the image

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.010
would decrease as you
stop down the aperture.

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:58.420
But in this case, they cheated.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.580
They normalized the
intensity to the full level

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.290
so it is visible
in the projector.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:05.590
But in a real system, it
would also become less bright.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:08.290
PROFESSOR: Right, OK so I
didn't notice that because I

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:09.570
didn't do the calculations.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.570
But yeah, OK.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:14.235
So of course, if this aperture
gets smaller and smaller,

01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:15.610
the amount of
light going through

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.320
gets smaller or smaller.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.250
And so in the end,
you'd end up with black.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:26.390
Right, so anyway we're now
going to make this even smaller.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:29.020
So what would you expect?

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.830
Well, you'd expect
that again the thing

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:34.070
to become more blurry looking.

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.730
And in fact, it
really does become.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:40.240
Just before we carry on,
just take this fully in.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.860
You notice that there are four
legs here, four straight lines.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.630
And these two are
closer together

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.960
than these other
spacings, right?

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.740
So as we decrease the
size of the pupil,

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.540
now you see what's happened.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.600
This is quite amazing.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.030
I was quite surprised at this.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:03.130
The four legs have
become three legs.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:07.470
So I guess these two central
legs are now not resolved.

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.770
They're below the
resolution limit.

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:14.400
And you'd have no idea of
course what that said now.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.860
It looks something
really blurred.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.590
So we're not getting enough
information obviously there

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:27.350
to be able to see
the image properly.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:32.520
OK, then let's try doing
some other funny things.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:36.870
So this one is a
high pass filter.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.400
Now, so what we're
doing here is we're

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.190
blocking out this
central part and letting

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:45.510
through all the other filters,
all the other frequencies.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.140
Now there's one
other thing that we

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:51.520
ought to mention here is that
this, of course, is done--

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.790
these calculations are
done using FFTs, right?

01:01:54.790 --> 01:02:00.280
So we're actually working
on a field of a certain size

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.210
when we calculate the FFTs.

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:06.570
The fact that this--

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:11.980
as you know FFTs do like a
sort of repeating, don't they?

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.600
Right, so this is not really
quite the same as this being

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.180
going out to infinity
in spatial frequency.

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.750
So I think that the result
in the image you might get

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:28.000
could depend a little on the
properties of the zero padding

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.640
and things like
that in this case.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.880
But anyway, this is
the image in this case.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.930
So you'll notice that we've got
the high spatial frequencies.

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:42.550
So we actually get some sort
of enhancement of the edges.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:46.870
You see the edges come out
really very crisply now.

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:49.510
So you get this
enhancement of the edges.

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.870
It's like an edge
enhancement filter.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:59.360
But on top of that, there's
a rather strange sort

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.670
of glowing patterns,
which I'm not really quite

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:04.280
sure what they refer to at all.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.020
But you could-- I
guess-- think of them

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.330
as being some sort of artifact.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:11.300
It looks a lot better on
this screen than that one.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.361
Interesting.

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:19.000
But if we do another of
these high pass filtering

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.200
but with the central
block even bigger,

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.790
this effect of edge enhancement
shows really nicely now.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:30.190
So all we're now
seeing is the edges.

01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:35.080
And the bits inside the letters
are not showing up or outside

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.040
the letters, so neither.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.370
I can't remember what the
object looked lie now.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.350
It's interesting.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:44.080
The object, whether
it was black writing

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.940
on a white background
or white writing

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.070
on the black background,
probably this

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:49.952
would look very similar.

01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:51.610
It wouldn't make a
lot of difference--

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:52.810
I don't think.

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:58.930
OK, and so all these examples
have been circularly symmetric

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.080
type patterns.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.080
But you can also, of
course, put in things which

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.180
are not certainly symmetric.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:10.310
So this is throwing out these
frequencies here and here.

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:11.900
So we haven't done
anything here.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.900
So we're going to have a high
resolution in that direction.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.800
But in this direction here,
we've reduced the resolution.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.190
So we'd expect it to be blurred
in the vertical direction.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:28.900
And of course, just to prove
that we can do the opposite,

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.090
and this one now is
going to be blurred

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:33.590
in the horizontal direction.

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:36.410
So you see here
again, you're almost

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:41.740
losing the resolution
of those four legs.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:52.230
OK, and then probably one of
the most important applications

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:57.220
of pupil filters is
in phase imaging.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:02.760
And so this leads on to
a Zernike face contrast,

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:08.000
which Zernike got
the Nobel Prize for.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.170
It's quite interesting.

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:12.120
It was a long time after he
invented it though, I believe.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.550
He invented it
sometime in the '30s.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:18.755
And it was commercialized--

01:05:18.755 --> 01:05:20.130
actually he seems
to have managed

01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:25.200
to get Zeiss and [? Leicher ?]
and everyone to make it.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.780
So he must have sold his
patent to lots of people.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.930
But anyway, eventually
it became very popular.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.930
But it didn't get it didn't get
the Nobel Prize until the '50s

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:38.130
some time.

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:43.640
And very useful
for a long time, I

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.090
think eventually it
got to a certain degree

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:53.240
anyway, outclassed by
some later techniques,

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.540
but still used a
fair bit in the lab.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.690
He has one advantage of
being quite cheap as well.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:04.220
Anyway, what you're trying to do
with [? phase-phase ?] contrast

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:06.130
is image of phase objects.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:10.550
And this is an example of what
a phase object might look like.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:16.910
Imagine, for example, you've
got some glass slide--

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:20.540
well, one thing which would
approximate quite well to this

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.690
is if you had a
biological cell sitting

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:25.720
on top of a glass slide.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.390
Right, so this shows
that something like that.

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:32.520
But actually what
we're thinking--

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.070
well, if it was a
cell, of course,

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.780
the refractive index
of this would be

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.850
slightly different from this.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:44.450
But that's really not
an important difference.

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:46.600
So this is looking
on the top of it.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.150
So here we've got
this object, which

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.340
has got a certain thickness.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.160
And what we'd like
to be able to do

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.850
is to produce an image
which actually shows up

01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.830
the shape of this
object, right, which

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:02.450
might be a cell or something.

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:06.110
And so this phase object--

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:10.010
we can think of the light
propagating through this

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:12.770
and producing a
phase shift then.

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.910
So the phase shift is
given by this expression.

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:21.680
So n here is the refractive
index of this cell.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.850
We have to have n minus 1, of
course, because the cell is

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.260
displacing air.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:31.130
So the cell wasn't there,
there would be air there.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:35.420
So we have to subtract away the
air that would have been there.

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:39.570
And so the phase is 2
pi times n minus 1 times

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:43.520
the thickness, which is a
function of x or of x of y

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.340
in this case, divided
by the wavelength.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:53.240
And so if we illuminate this
with some certain illumination

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.890
field this, then what we'll
get on the output side

01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:00.430
is just this times this.

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:04.340
There's no-- each of
the i phi, our object

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.930
just behaves here as
a pure phase object.

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:11.570
There's no modulus change,
only a phase change.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.080
Yeah, so useful for
imaging biological objects

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.640
such as cells,
but not only that.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:27.560
It's got applications in
material science, and so on.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:33.529
And yeah, so if
we looked at the--

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:38.149
image this illumination
is just unity.

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:41.689
And we look at the
modulus squared

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:44.479
of this object function.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:47.210
You see, because it's
just only a phase object,

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.310
when you look at
the modulus square,

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:51.060
you'll see nothing at all.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.290
So if you look at this in
an ordinary microscope,

01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.760
you wouldn't see anything.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.930
You'd just see completely
uniformly white.

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:02.720
And so you wouldn't see
the shape of this thing

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.890
that we're trying to see.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.680
So the question is, how
can we go about that?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.189
What can we do to solve that?

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:14.600
So yeah, what we're
now going to look at

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.130
is back to this MIT pattern.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.250
And we're going
to think of an MIT

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:24.540
pattern, which is now not
a binary object but a phase

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.500
object.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.210
So imagine that
this is our object.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.779
So this represents phase.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:40.360
So red represents a phase
change of 0.1 of a radian.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:49.590
And this one shows the modulus
of this object, which we're

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:53.160
assuming is completely uniform.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.850
And so it's a pure phase object.

01:09:57.850 --> 01:10:00.510
And if we looked at this in
our ordinary optical imaging

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:05.430
system, all we'd see is the
modular square of this thing.

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:09.280
So we'd see basically nothing.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.180
So the question is what can
we do to try and improve that.

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:17.080
Well, Zernike came
up with the answer.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.270
And actually, this is not
quite the way he does it.

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:22.270
We're not going to really
do the way he does it.

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:26.260
But the principle
is here anyway.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:31.360
What you do is you introduce
a pupil mask, which has also

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.000
got a phase objects in it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.320
It's got basically
a small region

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:43.090
at the center, i.e. where the
low spatial frequencies are,

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:46.450
which we change
the relative phase

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:50.290
of those spectral components
relative to the other spatial

01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:54.760
frequencies by pi over 2.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.330
And so we put that
in our in our system.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.120
And what we find,
as it says there,

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.070
is we can actually get
contrast of the phase.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:16.080
We actually see the phase now.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.030
And this will explain
why that works.

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.230
So this is what we're doing.

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.440
We're putting in our
phase MIT thing here.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.090
And we're putting in this
pi over 2 phase mask here.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.740
So that's what it looks like.

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.530
It's some bit of
dielectric, which

01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:39.600
has got this
central region which

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.200
changes the phase by pi over 2.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.680
Ideally, what we want
to do, as it says here,

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.930
is for this to be very small.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:50.610
What we're trying
to do is to use

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:54.600
it to change the phase
of just the DC component,

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.400
the unscattered light component
relative to all the rest.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.220
But of course, you can
never do that because it's

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:06.840
got to have some
definite real size.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.070
So whatever size
it is, there might

01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:15.270
be some low spatial frequencies
of the object, which

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.105
are going to be--

01:12:17.105 --> 01:12:18.480
the phase is going
to be changing

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.320
in the same way as the DC term.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.870
So let's look at the
mass of how that works.

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:30.240
So what we do is we assume
our phase object is what

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.080
we call a weak phase object.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.250
It's got the form
e to the i phi.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:42.720
But we think of that as being
approximately one plus i phi.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.990
And we neglect all
the other higher order

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:53.660
terms in the Haus's series
expansion for the exponential.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:58.670
And you can see then that in an
ordinary system, what we'd see

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:02.810
is you can think of it--

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:05.630
keeping all the terms,
the modular square of this

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:07.660
is obviously one.

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.130
And this also,
the modular square

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:14.210
of this to the first
order of small quantities

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.610
is also going to be one.

01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:19.550
Of course, if you square this,
you'll get phi squared terms.

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:21.260
But actually, there
are also really

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:25.980
some extra phi squared terms
in this series, which actually,

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.740
if you do it properly,
all cancel out.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:29.930
So you still must get one.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.440
OK, so what we're now going
to say, this is our object.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.210
But now, this object is going
to go through this mask here,

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:48.200
which is going to change the
relative phase of this relative

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.770
to this.

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:54.920
And so if we change
the one to i,

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.580
we're not going to
get i plus i phi.

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:01.520
And therefore now,
the output that we get

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.780
is going to be given by--

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.520
this should be into
i, intensity actually.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.740
Yeah, the intensity that you
see is the modular square

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:17.840
of this, which is 1 plus phi
squared, which to small--

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.100
Because phi is small,
we can expand that

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.560
to first two terms
of the series.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.900
And we get one plus two phi.

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.340
Right, so now we're getting
an image where the phase is

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.730
visible to the order of this--

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:39.200
order of the weak
phase object phi.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.230
In this case here, we
weren't seeing anything

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:43.660
to the order of phi.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.340
The lowest things
that were there

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.280
would be of the order
of phi squared, which

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.050
is going to be negligible if
phi is going to be small enough.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:55.050
Right, so there we are.

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:58.010
So by putting this
in, we've managed

01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:02.030
to make this phase
object visible.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.910
So this is the
demonstration of that.

01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:09.830
So this is our looking
out at our phase MIT.

01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:14.010
And this is the size
of our phase mask.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.490
So it's quite big here actually.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:25.970
And so I guess, it's changing
the phase of the central DC

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:26.810
term.

01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:30.770
But it's also changing the phase
of some low spatial frequency

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:35.210
terms of the MIT,
which I guess accounts

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:39.770
for some sort of
imperfections in this image.

01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:41.960
And I think a lot
of the ripples--

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.870
again, are coming from
the fact that this

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:48.290
has got a sharp edge to it.

01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:50.120
Probably if you
smoothed this, you

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.870
could make it so that you
didn't get such a strong ringing

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:54.740
in this thing here.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.510
But this is the next example.

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:04.150
We've now made
this a lot smaller.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:08.800
So it's now changing the
phase of the DC term.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.870
But it seems that the
object itself probably

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.830
has got very, very weak
components in that region.

01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:19.790
And you end up then with
this really wonderful image.

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:28.450
So I guess that really shows
the power of the Zernike phase

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.370
contrast method.

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:37.240
That's the end.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.530
How are we going?

01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:41.040
Good, we're up to time.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.910
I've been fast.

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:45.348
Right, any questions anywhere?

01:16:45.348 --> 01:16:47.390
Anyone want to look at
these nice pictures again?

01:16:54.788 --> 01:16:56.330
AUDIENCE: We had a
question actually.

01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:57.840
PROFESSOR: Yes good.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.920
AUDIENCE: It seemed like the
last analysis you're doing,

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.780
phi was much, much less than 1.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.820
But then you're saying
that phi was pi over 2.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:06.570
PROFESSOR: No, no.

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:07.720
Two different phi's.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.110
How do I get back in this?

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.400
TA: You click the play button.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.962
PROFESSOR: The play button.

01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:20.220
Ah, the play button.

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.470
It's right there.

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:24.530
Yeah, OK.

01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:26.390
So two different phi's.

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:32.240
The object is the one
that has to be weak.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:38.880
So here we said the
object has got this phi.

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.790
So we got e to the
i phi as the object.

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:47.820
And this phi has to be small.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:52.270
And somewhere it said--

01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:55.700
maybe it was after.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.696
The phase MIT objects--

01:17:58.696 --> 01:17:59.760
here we are.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.780
The phase MIT objects--

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:05.940
the phrase change
is 0.1 of a radian.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.820
So 0.1 of a radian we're
taking as being small.

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:15.310
But so red here represents
0.1 of a radian.

01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:20.580
Red there doesn't
represent 0.1 of a radian.

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.660
So this is our mask.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.230
So this has got a phase
change of pi by 2.

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:30.700
So this is much bigger
than 0.1 of a radian.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.720
OK?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.900
Yeah, so that's-- it's the
object that has to be a weak

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.320
phase object, not the mask.

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:45.000
TA: I think the principle still
works for strong phase objects.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.970
But the explanation is easier if
you assume a weak phase object.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:50.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:53.640
I think I agree with that.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.910
Yeah, but actually for
a strong phase object,

01:18:56.910 --> 01:19:00.610
you do also get an image in
your ordinary imaging system.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:05.400
But it's very complicated
to actually relate it

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.360
to the object.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.040
It's a bit like
frequency modulation.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.590
TA: Or another example
of a strong phrase object

01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:13.420
is the waves in a swimming pool.

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.140
They create an image
at the bottom which

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.660
looks like very bright lines.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.580
In a way these
lines are an image

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:24.720
of the index of
reflection of the water.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.430
And these lines are
known as caustics.

01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:29.490
But it is very difficult to
interpret them and relate them

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:32.360
to the actual
shape of the water.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:38.220
OK, any more questions?

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.320
Not many from this
end, today, either.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.030
I usually rely on [INAUDIBLE]
to come up with some questions.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.560
You know, at FOM, he
was in FOM, and he

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.110
asked the very first question
of the whole conference.

01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:55.233
TA: Oh, that is quite
the distinction.

01:19:55.233 --> 01:19:56.650
To the plenary
speaker, I imagine?

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:58.317
PROFESSOR: Yeah, to
the plenary speaker.

01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:03.520
All very clear?

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.970
I think these
demonstrations are really

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:11.470
great because I think that you
get a very nice feel for what

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:13.580
happens.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.100
TA: We have the quiz coming up.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.627
But we have enough time.

01:20:17.627 --> 01:20:19.335
Maybe we can introduce
temporal coherence

01:20:19.335 --> 01:20:21.060
at the beginning
of the next lecture

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:23.225
or should we just stop here?

01:20:23.225 --> 01:20:24.100
PROFESSOR: Up to you.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:30.460
TA: If anybody has no questions
at all, we have quiz coming up.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.470
This is your chance to
ask questions, I suppose.

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:34.910
PROFESSOR: So when's the quiz?

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:35.565
TA: On Monday.

01:20:35.565 --> 01:20:36.440
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:36.940
OK.

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:41.530
TA: That's why he could
not answer the question.

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:43.125
He was expecting a phone call.

01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:49.200
AUDIENCE: When you
have a phase grading,

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.792
normally you try to solve for a
system that has the 4f system,

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:56.250
you normally play
different tricks.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:21:03.690
One of them is you try to expand
part of the grading in Fourier

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:04.730
series.

01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:06.420
And after that,
you somehow managed

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.240
to decompose that
into something easy,

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:15.600
or you actually change the e
to the exponent to something

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.890
easier to handle in terms
of you look at the phase--

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:21.060
and you look at it.

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.660
And if it is like pi
over two or it's pi,

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:28.080
you change it to
something different

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.790
that it's easier to handle, any
advice on how to solve those?

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:34.560
I found those
particularly tricky

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.635
to actually get a grasp
of how to solve things.

01:21:39.635 --> 01:21:42.130
PROFESSOR: I'm not quite
sure you're saying.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.300
I mean if you've got--

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:46.090
I mean, you start off
by saying you've got

01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:49.270
some sort of gradient object.

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.310
And then if you
illuminate this, you'll

01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:56.040
get a series of
diffraction orders.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:00.720
And of course, you know, the
relative strengths of these

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.510
might be complex to account
for the phase changes.

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:11.610
And so what you're saying is
that by changing the phrase

01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:16.560
or whatever of these components,
you can improve the image.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.570
But is that what you're saying?

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:19.980
Something like that?

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my
question was more

01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:25.440
in the order of like
how to handle the math?

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.950
Normally if you get something
in terms of Fourier series,

01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:32.020
you get a bunch of terms.

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:37.583
And it's kind of like it
ends up being pretty messy.

01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:38.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.590
But you know, this is like
going through the mask.

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:48.440
So if we've got some mask which
has got some phase variation.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.850
So the relative strength
of these gradient orders,

01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:56.550
it will just be changed by
the phase of the phase mask.

01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:57.790
So the forward problem--

01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:00.580
I've got the feeling
that maybe you

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.820
were trying to solve the
inverse problem, you know.

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:09.490
If you know what the
image looks like,

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:11.650
how do you know how
to improve the image

01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:13.010
or something like that?

01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:18.100
But normally, of course, if
you knew what the object was,

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.402
then it probably wouldn't be
a lot of point in imaging it.

01:23:21.402 --> 01:23:24.280
But anyway, to calculate this,
this is all you have to do.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.540
Just multiply the strength
of these gradient components

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:34.120
by the strength of your mask,
both in amplitude and phase.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.730
So it's very
straightforward really.

01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:41.620
TA: And I don't think there's
a way out of the Fourier series

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.790
expansion.

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:45.400
Like if you really want to
solve this kind of a problem

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:50.257
with a phase gradient, you
must compute the Fourier series

01:23:50.257 --> 01:23:51.340
expansion of the gradient.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.760
Unless, for example,
if the phase is weak,

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.150
then you can simplify it as
we just saw in the example.

01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:01.430
But otherwise,
yeah, you have to go

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:04.960
through the pain of the
Fourier series expansion.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.080
OK, thanks.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.360
But you know, there are
some times of course,

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.527
for lots of other objects,
you can just look them up

01:24:11.527 --> 01:24:13.710
in the tables of
Fourier transforms.

01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:17.580
And even the Fourier
series, you can sometimes

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.500
get from that, of course.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.830
I mean, for example, you
know, these square wave

01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:24.810
gradients like this.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:32.040
You can think of this as being
this convolved with this.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.740
So the Fourier
transform of this is

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.140
going to be the Fourier
transform of this, which

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:40.640
is a sinc times the
Fourier transform of this,

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.380
which is another one of these.

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:48.590
Right, so you end up with
basically an envelope,

01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:53.800
which is this and then some
components within here.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.320
And the height of
these gives you

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.440
the strengths of these
different gradient components.

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.360
So I think there was a
sketch like that in one

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.350
of the earlier slides showing
how you can think of that.

01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:09.840
So these are the
strengths of the Fourier

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.990
series for this object.

01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:14.490
They're just given
by the product

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:20.418
of a sinc and an appropriately
scaled sampling function.

01:25:20.418 --> 01:25:22.710
TA: I think you need to push
the paper a little bit up.

01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:23.880
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.207
Yeah.

01:25:25.207 --> 01:25:25.790
Can I do that?

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:26.500
Oh, yeah.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.000
Sorry.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.550
There you can see
what I'm saying.

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:34.920
Yeah, so some
sometimes you can find

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:39.798
shortcuts to be able
to deal with some

01:25:39.798 --> 01:25:41.340
of these various
areas without having

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:44.520
to go through that the hard
work of doing what you did when

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.990
you were a first year student.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.620
TA: There was a homework like
that actually where it was not

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.720
quite phrased like
this-- but yeah,

01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.270
I had you guys
compute the Fourier

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:03.200
series in this clever way.

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.410
PROFESSOR: OK no more questions.

01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.270
Yes, [INAUDIBLE] got one.

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:14.066
Yeah?

01:26:14.066 --> 01:26:20.890
AUDIENCE: How did the idea of
numerical aperture come about?

01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:25.000
And why is it defined
as a sine of an angle?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.150
PROFESSOR: Rather the
tangent of an angle.

01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:28.440
Yeah, good point.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:31.780
Well, I guess it's because
George in one of the earlier

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:36.130
lectures pointed out that
according to Snell's law,

01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:38.800
you've got n sine
alpha is the invariant.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.840
So as rays goes through
a series of interfaces,

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.445
then that will be an invariant.

01:26:46.445 --> 01:26:48.110
It won't change.

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:52.150
So I think that was the
justification for it.

01:26:52.150 --> 01:26:55.440
But yeah, you've hit
something which is quite--

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.340
you know, the fact that
sine theta isn't tan theta

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:05.540
is basically why paraxial
optics eventually breaks down.

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:10.790
And so a lot of the stuff
that we've presented

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:14.680
has been based on assuming that
these angles are all small.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.330
And a lot of these
things just fail

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:23.090
if you can't assume that
these angles are small.

01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:25.310
TA: For example,
aberrations are another type

01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:31.090
of not shift invariant
behavior with the exception

01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:31.990
of spherical.

01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:35.290
But the aberrations
are not shift invariant

01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:38.800
so our approximations fail.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.100
For example, astigmatism
if you recall,

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:45.810
astigmatism occurs if you have
a plane wave entering the lens--

01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:48.240
I'm sorry, I
should've said coma.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.220
Coma occurs if you have
a plane wave entering

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:52.050
the lens at an angle.

01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:53.810
So of course, as you
increase the angle,

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:54.900
the coma becomes worse.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:28:02.050
So that is shift invariant

01:28:02.050 --> 01:28:03.770
PROFESSOR: OK, do you
want to stop or do

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:05.250
you want to say something?

01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:07.310
TA: We could talk
about the Talbot effect

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:10.430
that we skipped in
the previous lecture.

01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:14.288
I can have to do to find it.

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:16.580
PROFESSOR: I think that might
not be interested in that

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.372
because I don't think
my students have ever

01:28:18.372 --> 01:28:21.926
come across the Talbot effect.

01:28:21.926 --> 01:28:40.585
[INAUDIBLE] I was
just going to say--

01:28:46.372 --> 01:28:47.580
[INAUDIBLE] that's all right.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:48.810
I'll come and say it here.

01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:52.690
I was just going to say
that this Talbot effect.

01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:54.720
He was actually a
very long time ago.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.150
I can't quite
remember the history,

01:28:57.150 --> 01:29:01.350
but it's a very old effect.

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:04.260
TA: And I think Talbot was also
another professor of mechanics

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:09.180
who ended up doing contributions
in optics if I'm not mistaken,

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:13.380
very similar to Maxwell and
a bunch of other people.

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.300
No, no.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:15.795
I went the other
way around there.

01:29:15.795 --> 01:29:18.420
I shouldn't be expected to make
the contributions in mechanics.

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.360
[INAUDIBLE] OK, oh, I'm
not showing anything.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.183
I'm sorry.

01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:32.310
So the Talbot effect
is a phenomenon

01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:37.320
that happens when we have a
periodic pattern, for example

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.830
a gradient and you illuminate
it with a plane wave.

01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:45.670
And then what you do is you
observe the intensity pattern

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:50.010
forming after the
field diffracts,

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:52.890
after it has gone
through the transparency.

01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:55.350
So I don't when the
movie will show possibly

01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:58.020
because of something
[INAUDIBLE] the projector,

01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.412
it might not show.

01:29:59.412 --> 01:30:00.870
But if you look
carefully, you will

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:05.700
see that as the field diffracts,
the original grate and pattern

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.250
becomes visible at
certain distances.

01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:09.270
Then it disappears.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.050
Then it becomes visible again.

01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:14.420
It will play it in the
case of diagonal gradient

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.920
and then I will play
both of them again.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:21.270
So you can see, it diffracts,
then the sinusoid reappears

01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:22.225
and so on.

01:30:22.225 --> 01:30:23.850
In this case, it is
actually very clear

01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:27.480
when it will stop happening
because as we said,

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.300
in the case of a
gradient, in the field

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.440
after the gradient splits
up into diffraction orders.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.540
Now this gradient is finite, so
as you can see the diffraction

01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.140
orders separate.

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.710
And by the time it
reached here, you

01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:44.220
can see that you have basically
three rectangles that have

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.520
split up out of the gradient.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.860
So the Talbot effect will stop
happening when the rectangles

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.030
completely separate.

01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:52.560
It hasn't quite stopped yet.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.240
But it can only
happen that region

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.250
of overlap between gradients.

01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:59.473
OK, so the next--

01:30:59.473 --> 01:31:01.390
let me play this once
again so you can see it.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.880
So again, look out for the
repetition of the periodicity

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.320
of this pattern now.

01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:18.190
And again for the next one.

01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:23.750
I hope with this is
showing up also in Boston.

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:27.960
Here you can see it very
clearly on the projector.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.570
OK, so yes?

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:35.820
OK, so the next slide
is cross sections?

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.180
AUDIENCE: George?

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:39.910
Did you see that this
effect occurs only

01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:43.960
when there is an overlap between
the diffraction orders of the--

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.930
TA: Yes.

01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:46.930
So if the gradient is
infinite, then, of course,

01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:48.243
it occurs forever.

01:31:48.243 --> 01:31:50.410
But if the gradient is
finite, eventually the orders

01:31:50.410 --> 01:31:54.410
will separate and then
it doesn't happen.

01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:58.282
So this is cross sections
of the intensity pattern

01:31:58.282 --> 01:31:59.990
at different distances,
which of course I

01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:02.960
chose strategically
because I know the formula

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.800
that this effect follows.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.550
Of course, you don't
have the formula yet.

01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:10.220
But anyway, this
is what you see.

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.640
Now what is really
interesting and you may not

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.040
have seen in the previous
one, but there's also

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.790
a plane where you see a periodic
pattern at twice the frequency.

01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:23.880
So this like the second harmonic
of the original gradient.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:26.650
So the question is
why does that happen.

01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:29.630
Well, there is the physical
explanation, which is probably

01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:33.410
the most interesting.

01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:35.450
And that has to do
with the following.

01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:39.320
So this really goes to
the heart of diffraction,

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.690
why really diffraction
happens and why

01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:43.950
we see all of this phenomenon.

01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:47.550
So imagine that you
have a plane wave going

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:51.390
into a sinusoid
amplitude gradient.

01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:53.860
And of course, in this case
you only get three diffraction

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.900
orders, as we discussed,
the plus 1, the minus 1,

01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.860
and the [INAUDIBLE]

01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:01.680
And these diffraction
orders, each one of them

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.300
is really a plane wave.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.520
So you have now--

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.790
you started with one coming
in, but after the gradient,

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:11.930
you have three plane
waves propagating out.

01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:15.270
And imagine that you pick any
point of the gradient really,

01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:16.230
it doesn't matter.

01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:18.090
But let's pick this one.

01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:22.820
And we'll draw a
sphere over radius z.

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:26.190
we'll draw a sphere
centered at this point.

01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:28.170
Now if you compare
the three plane waves

01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:33.450
and you take rays
really, centered

01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:35.760
at the center of this
sphere, and if you

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:41.130
compare what happens to
these plane waves by the time

01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:43.440
that each of the
cell of this sphere,

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.340
then you realize that they
all have the same phase delay

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:50.910
because they only propagated the
same distance from the center

01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:52.130
to the edge of this sphere.

01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:53.980
They all propagated
by the same amount.

01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:55.920
So they have the
same phase delay.

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.370
However, when we
observe the field

01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:01.740
in all of this cross-section
that I showed before

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:04.290
in my movie and in
the calculation,

01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:07.140
I did not really observe
the field on a sphere.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:09.400
I observed it on a plane.

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.430
So if a center this plane at
a distance z from the axis,

01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:18.150
then the central order
that propagates a axis,

01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:20.430
it sustains itself
in phase delay.

01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:24.450
But you can see that the
plus one and minus one order,

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:27.660
they propagate the longer
distance from this sphere

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.920
to that gradient.

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.760
And you can calculate
this distance.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.090
It is the difference
between the z itself

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:38.060
and an expansion that is that
you get from its Pythagoras's

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:39.150
theorem.

01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:43.890
So this expression is basically
the hypotenuse of this triangle

01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:47.780
all the way out to the plane.

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.090
And if you do after that
the paraxial approximation,

01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:51.882
then you find that is
given by a quadratic.

01:34:51.882 --> 01:34:54.500
That is this is our
familiar quadratic term that

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.510
appears in the Fresnel kernel
and in all of these expressions

01:34:58.510 --> 01:35:01.040
of Fresnel diffraction.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:06.930
So however, now what
am I really observing?

01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:10.520
Well, in this plane, I observe
the interference pattern.

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.740
You can think of it as
a Fresnel diffraction

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:15.140
pattern from the
gradient or you can also

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.930
think of it as an interference
pattern between these three

01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:19.550
plane waves.

01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:22.940
It's like an
interferometer, right?

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:25.460
I mean, physically as I
think Professor separately

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.520
mentioned and I also mentioned
at some point or another,

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:31.198
diffraction is really no
different than interference.

01:35:31.198 --> 01:35:32.990
It is just that in the
case of diffraction,

01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:35.990
you have many, many, many
waves interfering produced

01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:39.210
by the Huygen's
wavelengths originating

01:35:39.210 --> 01:35:41.120
at your original object.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:42.830
But in this case,
instead of thinking

01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:44.630
of all these
Huygens wavelengths,

01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:47.030
I'm better off just
thinking about it

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:49.760
as plane waves interfering
because the physics

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.330
of the gradient tell me that
the diffracting field is really

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:56.210
composed of three plane waves.

01:35:56.210 --> 01:36:01.460
So now there's a phase delay
between this guy and this guy.

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:04.900
Actually, this guy and this
guy, the plus 1 and minus 1

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.800
are always in phase.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.790
But they can have a
difference in phase delay

01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:14.690
between the themselves
and the 0-th order.

01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:18.870
And of course, if that phase
delay happens to be 2 pi,

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:20.640
then there's no phase delay.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.470
And when did these things
start having no phase delay?

01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:27.720
Well, at the gradient, right?

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.840
So if I let this thing
propagate enough, whatever

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.810
parameter I can vary here is z.

01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:37.530
If I let z grow so that
this phase delay becomes

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:40.860
equal to 2 pi, then I
reproduced my original gradient

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:45.105
because of course, there
was no phase delay here.

01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:49.960
So when the phase
delay becomes 2 pi,

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.420
then again I will
see the same pattern.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:37:04.480
It is not as obvious why
you get the subharmonic, why

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.360
you get the second harmonic
that I discussed before.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.890
But there is a
little bit fortunate

01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:15.300
that the lectures got shuffled
in order because by now, you

01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.290
remember from one of the
examples of Professor

01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:21.520
Sheppard showed, when you
actually get rid of the DC

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.440
component, you can get
the second harmonic

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.330
to pop out all of a sudden.

01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:29.200
A very similar thing happens
if you get the pi phase shift.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.268
This pi phase shift can produce
a very distinct sub harmonic.

01:37:32.268 --> 01:37:33.226
So this is that reason.

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:42.393
Now the rest, I will
actually not go through.

01:37:42.393 --> 01:37:43.810
But there's a
mathematical-- well,

01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:45.435
I can go through very
quickly, I guess.

01:37:45.435 --> 01:37:47.730
There's a mathematical
way to derive it.

01:37:47.730 --> 01:37:49.510
And it is also
described in Goodman.

01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:51.780
And I also did it in the slides.

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.620
So if you start with
a grate with a field

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.880
after the gradient--

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.130
of course, you can express
it as a diffraction orders.

01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:03.040
We did this before.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.880
You can put it in a form the
field after the gradient.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.340
We've done this before ask in
the context of the 4f system.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.130
But mathematically,
it is really the same.

01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:14.800
Each one of these
exponentials in the field

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.000
will produce a delta function.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.760
Now, the question
is what happens

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:23.060
after the field propagates
by a certain distance.

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:28.870
So in order to do that, let me
show the Fresnel diffraction

01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:29.680
again.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.290
These we're familiar with.

01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:34.180
We said many times that
Fresnel diffraction

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.400
is expressed as a
convolution that

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.170
has to do with the
Huygen's wavelengths

01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:40.780
propagating and producing
spherical waves that

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.100
again interfere.

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:45.520
So the interference is expressed
as a convolution integral.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.600
But because of the properties
of the Fourier transform,

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.750
if I take a Fourier transform
of the output field,

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:56.270
then it will be expressed
as a product of the Fourier

01:38:56.270 --> 01:39:00.790
transform of the input field
times the Fourier transform

01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:04.660
of this Fresnel kernel.

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:08.020
And I really am not
going to prove this.

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:12.490
But you can look up in Goodman's
book in the table of Fourier

01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:13.390
integrals.

01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:15.820
You can look up the
Fourier transform

01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:18.070
of an expression like this one.

01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:20.770
And you'll find that
it looks very similar.

01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:24.158
This is a quadratic phase delay

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:25.200
It's a Fourier transform.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.240
It also looks like a
quadratic phase delay.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.350
But it has two key differences.

01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:32.020
One is that it has a minus sign.

01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:35.070
So it is actually quadratic
phase advance if you wish.

01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:37.450
And the second is, of course,
the [? scalene ?] theorem

01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:41.690
that will take up this factor
of lambda z from the denominator

01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:43.750
and will pop it up
in the numerator.

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:47.440
And of course, the happy
outcome of this scale operation

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.260
is that also the
units are preserved.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.414
This quantity has
to be dimensionless.

01:39:52.414 --> 01:39:53.122
So indeed, it is.

01:39:53.122 --> 01:39:56.560
I have distance square
in the numerator

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.240
as well as the denominator.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.320
In this case it uses
spatial frequency which

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.980
is inverse distance square.

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:05.500
By multiplying by
this distance squared,

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.490
I get again a one
dimensional quantity.

01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:10.030
So the [? scalene ?]
theorem works quite nicely.

01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:15.570
And you can also think then of--

01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:17.490
we talked about
transfer functions

01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:20.003
in the context
over the 4f system.

01:40:20.003 --> 01:40:22.170
But really you can also
think of a transfer function

01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:24.360
in the case of
Fresnel propagation

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.070
because it is shift invariant.

01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:29.430
Clearly if you have free
space, that is it truly

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:30.930
a shift invariant system.

01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:33.060
No matter where you
start in free space,

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:37.110
you would expect the field
to shift by the same amount.

01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:40.800
It would be really odd if
anything else happened.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.470
Unless you believe in space
and [INAUDIBLE] I guess.

01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:48.390
Only close to the Big Bang,
this property was not observed.

01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:51.720
But since billions of years
have lapsed since the Big Bang,

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.082
space is isotropic.

01:40:53.082 --> 01:40:54.540
So we don't have
to worry about it.

01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:58.110
So of course, the Fourier
integral approaches.

01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:00.540
And of course, then this
quantity that we derive

01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:03.060
is simply the transfer
function of free space.

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:07.190
It is another
quadratic phase delay.

01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:11.120
OK, so we can actually
apply this formulation now

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.230
to the mathematics
of the Talbot effect.

01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:31.780
All I have to do is multiply
the Fourier transform

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.840
of the gradient itself.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.650
All I have to do is multiply
it with a Fourier transform

01:41:37.650 --> 01:41:40.250
of the Fresnel
propagation kernel that is

01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:42.355
another quadratic phase delay.

01:41:42.355 --> 01:41:44.230
And this multiple
multiplication is very easy

01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:46.300
to do because I'm
multiplying the function

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.130
that I know with a bunch
of delta functions.

01:41:49.130 --> 01:41:54.400
So all that will remain
really is the value

01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:00.760
of this quadratic phase
delay computed at the spots

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.340
where the delta
functions occurred.

01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:06.200
And this is what I'm
doing the next slide.

01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:12.720
This looks a little
bit nasty but really

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.890
that's all you need to know.

01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:19.190
It looks like an expression
very similar to the gradient.

01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:20.820
This is the DC component.

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.610
This is the plus one
diffracted order.

01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:24.980
This is a minus one
diffracted order.

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:29.000
But it picked up this additional
quadratic phase delay,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.210
which is really it came
out of the math now.

01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:33.350
I used Fourier transforms
and convolutions

01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:34.500
and everything else.

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:43.070
But if you go back to my
picture here with the sphere

01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:45.530
and the phase delays,
you can really

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:49.520
see that this is really
the same expression.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.400
It came out of the
math in one case.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.140
It really came out
of a physical picture

01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.390
of phase delay of [? planes ?]
as they propagate.

01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:57.390
But it's all consistent.

01:42:57.390 --> 01:43:04.010
It is nearly all
the same answer.

01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.950
And after a little
bit more pain,

01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:16.080
which involves really taking
one Fourier transform,

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:22.970
and then combining these
things to form a sinusoid,

01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:26.210
you'll get this
expression for the field.

01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:31.160
And now you can see what I
was saying before, if you--

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.830
this looks like a
nasty phase delay

01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:34.940
that got appended to
the diffracted field.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.740
This is really
diffracted field now.

01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.540
So this is the Fresnel
diffraction pattern

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.770
from a gradient.

01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:45.780
But if this quantity and
exponent happens to be 2 pi,

01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.180
then it is not there anymore.

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:49.160
So you recover your
original gradient.

01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:54.350
OK, that's the intensity.

01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:56.760
And you can also see
from this-- you can also

01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.600
get the condition for the
second harmonic generation.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.580
Basically, if you
kill this term, which

01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.250
means that this quantity
becomes pi over 2,

01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:06.230
then this disappears.

01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:08.730
So all you're left is the cosine
squared, which is of course

01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:10.090
the second harmonic.

01:44:10.090 --> 01:44:16.300
So this is really delineated
in the next slide.

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.460
If the propagation distance--

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.830
if this quantity, this
is also non-dimensional.

01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:23.440
It is distance squares
over distance squared.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.890
If you propagate far
enough so that this equals

01:44:26.890 --> 01:44:30.100
an even integer, then
you get the replica

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.690
of the original gradient.

01:44:31.690 --> 01:44:33.970
This is basically--
this quantity

01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:37.000
becomes a phase delay of 2 pi.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.690
If you get it to become equal to
[? n, ?] you call this distance

01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:44.580
a Talbot play.

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:49.320
If you're get it to propagate
so that it is an odd integer,

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.940
then it is pi that
shifts this term by pi.

01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:55.550
Basically, you flip the sign.

01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:56.860
Now the gradient has shifted.

01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:00.680
If you really do work it out,
you still get the same sinusoid

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:03.430
but shifted by half a period.

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:07.560
And finally, if you completely
eliminate the linear term

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.210
by choosing--

01:45:09.210 --> 01:45:14.790
this tends to be pi over 2 or
3 pi over 2 or 5 pi over 2,

01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:18.120
and so on and so forth,
then you can actually get--

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.380
I forgot to put to
close my bracket here,

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:24.060
but anyway, then you
get the period doubled.

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:27.270
And you'll get the
second harmonic.

01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:30.070
OK, and this the schematic.

01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:32.380
These are basically now
repeating periodically

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:37.860
every time you add this
propagation distance--

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:41.250
I'm sorry, these
are flipped here.

01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:44.940
This should have been 2 lambda
z over lambda squared, 2 lambda

01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.210
z over lambda squared.

01:45:46.210 --> 01:45:49.410
So basically every time you
propagate by this quantity,

01:45:49.410 --> 01:45:51.540
you go from a Talbot
sub plane where

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:54.580
you have a second
harmonic to a half period

01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:58.760
shift, to another second
harmonic to a replica.

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.000
And then it repeats.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.790
So these are the Talbot plains.

01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:06.280
Now we're out of
time so I will say

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.870
something that's
interesting for those

01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:12.150
of you who have time to stay.

01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:15.670
This-- as Professor
Sheppard mentioned

01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:18.860
has been noticed since
a very long time ago.

01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:21.950
But more recently, it became
actually kind of a hot topic

01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:24.730
over [INAUDIBLE]
because people noticed

01:46:24.730 --> 01:46:29.740
that it happens not only
in sinusoidal gradients,

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:34.180
but it can also happen in
every periodic pattern.

01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.700
If, for example, you
have a square gradient,

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:39.562
it would also have
its own Talbot planes.

01:46:39.562 --> 01:46:41.020
And then, not only
that, but people

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:47.570
noticed that it can happen
in some strange patterns that

01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:50.560
are called was quasi-crystals.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.260
So I don't know how many of you
have taken solid state physics.

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:56.020
But in solid state
physics they teach you

01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:02.132
that there are certain
patterns in nature that--

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.258
there's often
symmetries in nature.

01:47:09.258 --> 01:47:10.800
For example, a very
simple symmetries

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.370
is rectangular symmetry.

01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:17.620
If you take this as a unit
cell and then you repeat it,

01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:20.500
you can keep filling out the
space like this periodically.

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:23.130
Another example is a hexagon.

01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:26.253
Let's see if I know
how to do the hexagon.

01:47:26.253 --> 01:47:27.420
I ended up doing an octagon.

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.128
Sorry about that.

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:37.220
That's a pentagon.

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:38.410
I need one more, OK.

01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:39.460
I got my hexagon, OK.

01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:45.390
That's nice because
this does repeat.

01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:48.970
OK, never mind anyway.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.570
OK, that will repeat.

01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:57.070
Good.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.770
OK, so fortunately I
did a pentagon also.

01:48:08.042 --> 01:48:09.500
So the question is
what will happen

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:13.350
if you start sticking
pentagons next to each other.

01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:16.760
Now this will be really
impossible for me to do,

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.890
but you can imagine
if you tried to stick

01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:22.730
another pentagon, identical
pentagon next to here,

01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:27.860
then you will get something
like this, I guess.

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:29.680
And then you can keep doing it.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.650
But you noticed when I did it,
then I got to stick a pentagon

01:48:33.650 --> 01:48:35.990
but it is slightly rotated.

01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:38.150
It is still is
difficult for me to draw

01:48:38.150 --> 01:48:41.570
but if you google
quasi-crystals.

01:48:46.522 --> 01:48:48.730
I don't know if it's the
first website that comes up.

01:48:48.730 --> 01:48:51.250
There's a website at Caltech,
in the physics department

01:48:51.250 --> 01:48:51.910
at Caltech.

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:54.310
And you will see some
very nice pictures

01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:57.670
of what happens if you stick
pentagons next to each other.

01:48:57.670 --> 01:48:59.860
That's called a quasi-crystal.

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.610
OK, now why are people
interested in this?

01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:04.450
Physicists are interested
because in solid state

01:49:04.450 --> 01:49:07.870
they teach you that if
you have atoms arranged

01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:13.180
in one of the patterns that
produce symmetries, then

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:18.240
if you pass X-rays through
this symmetric lattice,

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:20.250
you get a diffraction
pattern, very

01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:23.250
similar to a gradient
that we saw here,

01:49:23.250 --> 01:49:25.920
except that we're in 3D
because the symmetries are

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.030
very simple in 2D.

01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:28.620
I think in 2D you only get two--

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:31.188
you get the rectangular
and the hexagonal symmetry.

01:49:31.188 --> 01:49:32.730
In 3D, you get many
more symmetries--

01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:34.110
I forget, how many do you get?

01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:38.680
I think it is 7 groups
or 12 or anyway.

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.430
I should refresh my
solid state physics.

01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:44.650
But anyway, each one of
these gives rise to--

01:49:44.650 --> 01:49:48.350
each symmetry gives rise to a
distinct diffraction pattern.

01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:49.870
And then crystallographers
basically

01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:51.610
bypass the next
stage to a crystal

01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:53.560
and observe the
diffraction pattern--

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:56.170
they can guess what was
the original symmetry that

01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:58.220
produced it.

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:01.670
We also know that non
symmetric patterns

01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:03.290
can produce diffraction.

01:50:03.290 --> 01:50:06.680
And that is what won Crick
and Watson the Nobel Prize

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.210
because they figured out
that you have a helix, which

01:50:09.210 --> 01:50:11.620
not quite symmetric, it can
still produce a diffraction

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:12.320
pattern.

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.850
And Crick was a very clever
mathematician who solved it.

01:50:14.850 --> 01:50:17.240
And he won the
Nobel Prize for it.

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.020
Anyway, recently people have
observed that quasi-crystals

01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:22.730
like this one-- if
you take pentagons

01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:24.500
and you stick them
next to each other,

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:26.400
they also produce a
diffraction pattern,

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
which looks actually
like a bunch

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.907
of bright dots in a
pentagonal kind of symmetry.

01:50:33.907 --> 01:50:34.740
It looks very funny.

01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:38.760
If you go to this Caltech
website, you will see it.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.520
And then people also noticed
that this kind of thing

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:44.010
also produces Talbot patterns.

01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:50.550
If you you diffract a field
from a pentagonal quasi-crystal,

01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:54.390
it will produce Talbot patterns
as you'll go behind it.

01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:56.340
And that caused
quite a bit of stir.

01:50:56.340 --> 01:51:00.600
Actually there's a lot of papers
analyzing this and looking

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.860
into this interest.

01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:05.875
Anyway, so I don't know
if this has any use--

01:51:05.875 --> 01:51:07.250
it's kind of
interesting physics.

01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:11.020
But yeah, people spend
some time on that.

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:20.840
Oh, yeah.

01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:33.480
Actually, Talbot effect
found a use recently

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.350
in a very surprising
way in lithography.

01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:43.100
It is a very easy way to
reproduce a pattern lenslessly,

01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:46.590
as long as the
pattern is periodic.

01:51:46.590 --> 01:51:49.940
And so for planar
lithography is not

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:52.100
that interesting,
but nowadays many

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:55.780
people who want to make photonic
crystals which are periodic.

01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.710
So in the photonic crystals, you
want to start with the volume.

01:51:58.710 --> 01:52:00.380
So this is a
cross-section, and you

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:05.280
want to write patterns
that look like this.

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.630
So for example, what you
do is you take a polymer--

01:52:08.630 --> 01:52:09.710
OK, I take it back.

01:52:09.710 --> 01:52:14.000
You take a monomer and if you
could expose some [INAUDIBLE]

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.018
these regions and
then you develop it,

01:52:19.018 --> 01:52:20.810
then you would end up
with a structure that

01:52:20.810 --> 01:52:24.530
has low index in the unexposed
regions and high index

01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:26.030
in exposed regions.

01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:28.090
That is a photonic crystal.

01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:29.820
So the question is
how could you do this.

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.720
Well, one way is
with a Talbot effect

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:34.520
because a Talbot effect will
actually focus the light very

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:40.157
sharply in the Talbot planes and
then you'll get your exposure.

01:52:40.157 --> 01:52:42.240
But everywhere else, the
light is kind of diffuse.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.270
So it does not expose very much.

01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:47.660
So if you play with the
threshold of the photoresist,

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:50.240
you can actually get the
pattern to work like this.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.360
So there's a colleague of
mine at MIT, Ned Thomas.

01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:54.830
I don't know if any of Ned's
students are in the class.

01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:57.200
But he came up with
a very clever system

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:02.120
that he can expose and create
photonic crystals this way.

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.460
And then interestingly,
a student of mine

01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:12.550
discovered that if you vary
the duty cycle of this thing,

01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:14.450
I may be disclosing--

01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:16.550
everybody here is MIT, right?

01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:19.100
And those of you who are
NUS are sort of bound

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.150
by a vow of secrecy or whatever.

01:53:21.150 --> 01:53:22.990
But anyway, I may be
disclosing something

01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:24.710
that we have a
patent pending for.

01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:27.380
But anyway, so it
is also well known--

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:34.360
people have analyzed
patterns with a duty cycle

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:37.313
that these different
[INAUDIBLE] point have.

01:53:37.313 --> 01:53:39.730
So for example, if you have a
gradient that is like this--

01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:45.850
this also produces
a Talbot effect.

01:53:45.850 --> 01:53:49.470
So it will also produce
replicas of that pattern.

01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:52.315
So but my student discovered
that if you vary the duty

01:53:52.315 --> 01:53:54.440
cycle, that's really
interesting and we don't fully

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.660
understand why but it is true.

01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.780
I mean, it is physically
correct-- we don't know how

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.460
to explain it very intuitively.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.210
But mathematically,
you find that you have

01:54:04.210 --> 01:54:07.380
a pattern with a fixed period.

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:16.810
But the variable duty cycle,
for example, like this,

01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:19.120
it also for this
is a Talbot effect.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.370
Not forever, but over a
finite region maybe about--

01:54:24.370 --> 01:54:27.030
I don't know, it depends but
maybe about 10 or so Talbot

01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:29.750
planes, it reproduces itself.

01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:32.772
So it is also possible to
make non-periodic patterns,

01:54:32.772 --> 01:54:35.230
which as [? Colin ?] knows,
we're very interested in making

01:54:35.230 --> 01:54:36.907
non-periodic kind of--

01:54:36.907 --> 01:54:38.740
they're not for [? tiny ?]
crystals anymore,

01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:42.340
but they're not periodic
strong index modulations.

01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:46.820
That is possibly
one way to do it.

01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.080
AUDIENCE: George,
it seems like it

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:53.140
seems like that was still
a periodic pattern though.

01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:56.318
TA: No, because the
duty cycle varies.

01:54:56.318 --> 01:54:58.610
We call it periodic because
you must have the same duty

01:54:58.610 --> 01:55:00.500
cycle in every period.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.950
AUDIENCE: So even though
it repeats every period

01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:07.190
with a different duty
cycle, that's not periodic.

01:55:07.190 --> 01:55:10.345
TA: I don't know, would you
call this function periodic?

01:55:10.345 --> 01:55:12.470
AUDIENCE: I understand what
you mean about the duty

01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:15.155
cycle changing, but it's
got a definite period to it

01:55:15.155 --> 01:55:16.470
where features are--

01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:17.420
TA: Yeah.

01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:21.710
Yeah, but it's non-periodic.

01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:25.860
OK, what you're saying
is a possible explanation

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:28.020
for why it has a Talbot effect.

01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:30.330
It has a Talbot
effect because it

01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:34.370
has this fundamental period
underlined the variable duty

01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:35.070
cycle.

01:55:35.070 --> 01:55:36.778
AUDIENCE: Right, I
look at the duty cycle

01:55:36.778 --> 01:55:39.720
as changing the orders
that are coming out

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:41.160
for that particular region.

01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:47.700
TA: Well, in a slowly varying
approximation, perhaps.

01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:49.110
Yes.

01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:50.990
I mean, this thing--

01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:52.880
I've not looking at
the diffraction pattern

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880
of this thing in detail.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.810
But yes, it would produce
diffracted orders.

01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:01.860
But it is not clear how you
would compute their strength

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:03.360
from a Fourier series.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:05.390
At least, I don't
know how to do it.

01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:09.800
There may be a way with somebody
adiabatic approximation.

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:12.840
Because it is true
that in our simulation,

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.890
the duty cycle was
very slowly varied.

01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:17.250
And I believe it is also true.

01:56:17.250 --> 01:56:18.542
In fact, I think Will--

01:56:18.542 --> 01:56:20.750
my student who did this--
he also did this simulation

01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:23.690
with a fast, varying duty
cycle, and he found out

01:56:23.690 --> 01:56:26.120
that the Talbot effect
actually does not happen

01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.280
if the duty cycle varies fast.

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.210
So, yeah.

01:56:29.210 --> 01:56:34.130
There's certainly an adiabatic
approximation happening here.

01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:38.480
But I guess we haven't really
worked out all the details.

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:40.910
But it is sort of
interesting still.

01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:51.180
Anyway, yeah, it's one
of those things that--

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:53.710
the reason I'm bringing it up
is because the Talbot effect

01:56:53.710 --> 01:56:56.290
doesn't look like something
particularly useful.

01:56:56.290 --> 01:56:58.660
It looks more like a curiosity.

01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.830
But yeah, I guess
sometimes even curiosities

01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:03.220
can find applications, right?

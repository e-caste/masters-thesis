YEN-JIE LEE: I think
chalkboard is much more

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.540
natural for the
students and for me

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.070
because if I write all the
equations on the slides, first

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.680
of all, all those equations
appear at the same time.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.220
And so it is actually
harder for the student

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.160
to follow the logic
between formulas.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.280
And my feeling is that
it is so much naturaler

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.980
to see all those
equations popping up

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.900
in a logical sequence for them.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.400
And by writing down
them on the chalkboard,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.730
people have time to
think as well, what

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.870
is actually happening.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
And I have also the freedom to
point to the relevant equation

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.820
on the board slowly so
that people, everybody

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.129
who is not very familiar with
the mathematics can follow.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.090
Factorial x squared,
plus V triple prime 0

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.100
divided by 3 factorial x to
the third, plus infinite number

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.090
of times.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.600
And the V(0) is the position
of where you have minimum.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.650
So I think that's
actually a decision

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.690
to use chalkboard in
combination with slides.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.840
Usually, my slides
contain information

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.790
which is actually
already covered

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.320
from the previous lecture.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.850
So that serves a purpose to
flash through the information

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.560
which is actually
already covered

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.310
duirng the last few lectures,
to remind people that, OK, you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.600
have learned this before.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.350
Right?

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.230
And so I don't have
to waste a lot of time

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.870
to copy them on the chalkboard
because they already

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.900
learned that.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.890
And secondly, I can use slides
to include interesting figures,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.789
interesting videos, interesting
pictures, et cetera,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.700
so that it should be that is
complementary to my chalkboard

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.730
teaching style.

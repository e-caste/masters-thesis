00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.620
ANDREW LO: So what I want to do
in this lecture is to provide

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.570
a quick overview of
the equity business,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.250
and then talk about a couple
of simple but rather powerful

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.700
models to price equities-- we're
using the exact same tools that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.110
we've developed--

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.960
and then talk a bit about
growth opportunities and growth

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.440
stocks.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.770
OK, so industry overview.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.770
What is equity?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.540
As I said, it's an
ownership in a corporation.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.780
And typically, when you own
a piece of a corporation,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.310
you're owning that
sequence of cash flows.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.810
There are two components
of possible cash flows

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.360
for a piece of equity security.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.760
One is dividends.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.950
But, of course, we know
that there are companies

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.020
that don't pay dividends.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.440
Typically, companies that are
early stage growth companies,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.570
they want to conserve
their cash, because they've

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.360
got lots and lots
of investment ideas

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.690
that they want to implement.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.530
And so any cash that's
generated internally,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.190
they're going to be plowing
back into current operations.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.440
So growth companies typically
don't pay dividends.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.540
But you still get value
from the security,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.990
because as the firm grows,
as the corporation becomes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.570
more valuable, that piece
of paper that you hold

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.740
becomes more valuable.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.020
So in other words,
you get capital gains

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.050
or price appreciation
of that piece of paper.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.530
And if you want to get value
out of that price appreciation,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.660
you could always sell it, right?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.980
So those are the two
ways of getting value.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.170
It's dividends-- and
by the way, there

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.760
are two different
forms of dividends.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.120
Cash dividends or
stock dividends,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.200
both of which provide
additional value.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.389
But also the fact is
that you could sell it,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.330
and so you can get money
from capital gains.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.110
Now there are a couple of key
characteristics of common stock

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.690
that are distinct from bonds.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.550
The cash flows we will
be able to analyze

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.970
using the same tools, but
those tools will ultimately

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.480
give us different answers,
because the legal structure

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.660
for equities is
different than for bonds.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.380
And I have to say, that
whoever invented equities--

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.800
this is many, many
centuries ago--

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.910
really was a brilliant
financial innovator,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.860
because equities have just an
enormously powerful ability

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.910
to provide proper motivation
and incentives for innovation,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.260
all sorts of innovation.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.910
And let me explain
what that means.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.340
First of all, one
aspect of equities

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.810
that I think you
all probably know

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.550
is that they are the residual
claimant to a corporation's

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.180
assets after the bondholders.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.380
In other words,
bondholders have first dibs

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.580
on the assets of the company,
but their claim on those assets

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.680
is only equal to the face
value or promised payments

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.890
of that debt, right?

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.800
They don't have access
to any more than what

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.800
the face value of that
bond is, as well as

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.650
the coupons along the way.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.730
And to say that equity holders
are the residual claimant

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.790
means that they get
everything else.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.500
Now you might say,
gee, that's not really

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.260
all that interesting, because
you're second in line.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.700
Well, it's very interesting
if being second in line

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.810
means that you get access to
all of the upside of a company's

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.880
growth and success.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.970
I'm sure that you've all heard
of stories of entrepreneurs

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.680
that have made many hundreds
of times what they put

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.850
into a company, whereas the
bondholders may have gotten

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.710
a handsome return
of 10, 15, 20%,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.100
but that's the upper bound
as to what they can get.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.940
As a bondholder, your upside
is capped, it's limited, OK?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.060
Whereas, as the residual
claimant, as the equity holder,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.930
you have no limit on
your upside, right?

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.170
Because once the bondholders get
paid, you get everything else.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.210
Now the other aspect of
equity that's really important

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.060
is something called
limited liability--

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.390
the fact that, as an equity
holder, the most you can lose

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.530
is everything.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.000
Now that might not seem like
a good deal, but trust me,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.490
it's an amazing deal.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.170
By everything, we mean
everything that you put in,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.840
so it's not
literally everything.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.290
For example, you
don't lose your life.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.880
You don't lose your freedom.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.650
You don't lose your pinkie.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.940
You don't lose any other
body parts, or loved ones.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.650
All you are at risk of losing is
what you put in to the venture.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.060
So that's what limited
liability means.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.920
And the reason that
it's an innovation

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.220
is, prior to the
modern-day corporation

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.650
and limited liability,
it used to be

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.360
the case that entrepreneurs
faced unlimited liability,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.360
or you could be put
in prison if you were

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.480
to default on your obligations.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.740
The fact that there is a
downside limit to what you

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.810
could possibly lose is a
tremendous boon to innovation,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.490
because now it means that
each and every one of you

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.230
can go out and start
your own company

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.820
and risk whatever money you
want to put into the company,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.610
but no more.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.570
And if it doesn't
work out, well, you

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.150
can walk away and do it again.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.390
And I suspect many
of you know of

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.890
so-called serial entrepreneurs
that just go from one company

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.389
to another to another.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.430
Many years ago, when I
was at the Wharton School,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.080
I heard a talk by the person
who started up Domino's Pizza.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.810
I unfortunately don't
remember his name,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.570
but he was giving a talk
in one of these CEO series

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.410
and he's a billionaire, because
of the incredible growth

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.590
of Domino's Pizza
in the country.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.170
And somebody asked
this fellow, how

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.260
did you know that having
a national pizza chain

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.070
was going to succeed
as well as it did?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.640
And he's very honest.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.500
He said, you know,
I didn't know.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.130
You know, this was
my ninth company.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.524
The first eight went bankrupt.

00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:06.940
And if this one
had gone bankrupt,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.360
I probably would've
started a tenth.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.220
And I think that's just
a wonderful expression

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.560
of the power of
modern capitalism

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.550
and limited liability, because
here's an individual that just

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.662
really wanted to do
something on his own

00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:22.120
and wanted to make
a success of it,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.549
and was willing to
work his heart out time

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:26.590
after time after time
until he hit upon something

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.210
that was really valuable.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.330
And that's the power
of limited liability.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.510
Think what innovation
would be if we decided

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.420
that if your first company
fails, from that point on,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.140
you would never be allowed to
start a company ever again.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.890
Think how many people
would take the risk

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.670
or take the plunge to do
something like starting up

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.330
your own company.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.870
So the fact that we
have a security that

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.000
limits your downside,
and that limits

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.280
the downside of
other investors that

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.160
want to join you in
your venture, really

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.960
allows for capital
formation to occur at a rate

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.470
and at a scale that would
be impossible without it.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.650
Now there's also voting
rights and the ability

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.540
to access public markets.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.060
What that means is
that you can actually

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.240
get other people, large
numbers of people,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.270
to co-invest with you.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.490
So that's particularly
important when

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.370
you're thinking about taking on
very, very ambitious projects.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.890
For example, if you want to
start up a biotech company.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.580
Biotech companies require more
than a few hundred thousand

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.929
dollars to get started.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.059
I think a few hundred
thousand dollars would maybe

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.570
buy you a quarter of a
centrifuge these days.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.970
Doesn't really help for
starting up a biotech company.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.580
And so if we didn't
have the ability

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.950
to access public markets, if
we didn't have the ability

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.790
to bring the power
of the public to bear

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.490
on a particular
investment opportunity,

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.510
it wouldn't get done.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.460
So that combination of
limited liability and ability

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.400
to access public markets,
and then voting rights

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.990
that give investors some say
in how the company is run,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.060
is really the
secret to unlocking

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.210
the power of the masses for
development of innovation

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.112
and capital formation.

00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:25.320
Now there's another point
that I wanted to make here,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.520
which is short sales.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.160
I think that by
now you should have

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.950
an appreciation for the
importance of short sales.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.470
Short sales allow information to
get into the market price that

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.500
may not be positive
news, but is nevertheless

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.850
important for people to have.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.690
And so the ability to
short sell a security

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.840
is a method for
allowing investors

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.330
to get information
into the market price

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.780
as quickly and as
easily as possible.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.150
Those of you who participated
in the trading game

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.420
that we did a couple of
weeks ago on that Friday--

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.150
you know, when we go over
the results towards the end

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.820
of this course, when we talk
about efficient markets,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.250
I'm going to show you
that the prices that

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.700
occurred in that marketplace
was not very efficient.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.700
Part of the reason that
it wasn't very efficient

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.980
is because we didn't
allow you to short sell.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.210
And so those of you who had the
information that at one point

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.220
the stock was worthless,
the most you could have done

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.910
was to divest yourself of
shares that you already owned.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.580
But once you did that,
that was the end,

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.990
and you're out of the market.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.910
You couldn't do anything more.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.210
If, on the other hand, we
allowed you to short sell,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.700
you would have driven that
price down to 0, where

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.480
it belonged at that point.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.560
And so the ability to short
sell is a very, very important

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.140
aspect of capital
market efficiency

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.970
and for making prices as
informative as you can.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.540
Now there are two markets
for equities-- primary market

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.830
and secondary market.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.360
Primary market means the
market where securities are

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.650
issued for the very first time.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.890
Primary, that's
what primary means.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.870
Secondary you could think of as
the market for used securities.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.850
We have a market for used cars.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.770
You have a market
for used homes.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.640
And there's a market
for used securities.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.139
I know you don't really think
of the New York Stock Exchange

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.370
as such, but, in fact, it is.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.490
It just turns out that
used securities are just

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.780
as good as new securities,
and in many ways, better.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.340
And so the steps for getting
a primary security issued

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.070
is very different than
the steps for dealing

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.972
with secondary markets.

00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:42.430
For the most part,
what we're going

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.870
to be talking about
in this course

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.790
is secondary market
transactions and dynamics.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.340
However, there is
obviously a lot more

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.990
to be said about
primary markets.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.130
I'm going to leave that to other
courses in the Finance group,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:03.490
including M&A and capital
budgeting and venture capital.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.910
Those are courses that
deal with the dynamics

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.450
of the primary market.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.440
These are the markets
that you would care about

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.560
if you're doing an IPO,
launching a new company,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.796
and issuing securities
for the very first time.

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:19.420
So I won't spend too
much time on that.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.253
If you're interested,
you're welcome to read

00:12:21.253 --> 00:12:24.107
the relevant chapters
in the textbook.

00:12:24.107 --> 00:12:25.690
But what we're going
to do is to focus

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.320
on the behavior of
secondary markets,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.250
in particular, in
the price formation

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.080
mechanism for secondary
market securities.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.110
Here's a little bit
of a summary about how

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.850
these markets have developed.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.850
You can see that
for primary markets,

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.520
the IPO market goes
through cycles.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.970
There are periods where the
market's very, very active,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.060
and there are periods where
the market is pretty quiet

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.360
and not a lot is going on.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.990
That has to do a lot
with the business cycle

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.217
and with the credit cycle-- how
much money there is out there.

00:13:02.217 --> 00:13:04.300
And it's obviously very
important for those of you

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.883
who are thinking
about doing startups,

00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:08.410
because when you do a
startup and you get funding

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.870
from a venture capitalist,
the way the venture

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.810
capitalist ultimately
gets paid is not

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.320
by the satisfaction of being
part of your wonderful company,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.410
but rather by having
your company go public

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.010
and having securities be
issued so that the venture

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.400
capitalist can cash out at
those public market prices.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.850
So the venture capital
and technology industries

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.930
are very much caught up in the
business cycle and credit cycle

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.760
as well, and so this
gives you a little bit

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.490
of a picture of how
that's changed over time.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.180
On the other hand,
the secondary market

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.950
has a somewhat different
set of dynamics.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.460
It's related, but not
nearly as highly correlated

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.710
as you might expect.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.190
This is an example
of the dynamics

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:02.500
of public secondary
markets, the NYSE and NASDAQ

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.380
over the last few years.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.860
What this displays is
the trading volume,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.820
both measured in terms
of shares as well as

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.510
in composite fraction
on the NYSE volume.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.320
And you can see that
over time that the share

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.260
volume, the amount
of shares traded,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.516
has just gone up year
on year, and this year

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:28.390
will be no different.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.720
2008 will be a tremendously
significant year

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.780
for the amount of shares
traded on the exchange.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.220
Lots more participation in
public markets, and the volume,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.710
while there may be little bits
of a dip that are functions

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.100
of business cycles,
not nearly as sensitive

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.565
as the primary market is.

00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:47.065
Yeah.

00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:49.927
AUDIENCE: Is the internet
also, you know, more volume?

00:14:49.927 --> 00:14:51.010
ANDREW LO: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.500
Well, there are a number of
technological innovations

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.400
that have made this market
increase so quickly.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.570
So the internet is one.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.350
Now all of us can
trade on the internet.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.195
In fact, when I was teaching
Finance back in, let's see,

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.900
was it 2000 or 2001?

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.990
I remember during
the middle of the day

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.670
one of the undergraduates
in the class

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.900
looked at some kind of cell
phone device and then ran out.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.512
And he came back in shortly
before the end of class,

00:15:23.512 --> 00:15:24.970
and at the end of
class I asked him

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.595
if everything was
all right, because he

00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:27.720
seemed really distressed.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.094
And then he said
that he just had

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.260
to respond to a margin
call on his equity position

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.240
that he'd put on the day before.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.810
This is an undergraduate.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.180
He's trading on his
little cell phone.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.740
That's a technological
innovation

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.300
that has actually increased
the volume in these exchanges.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.280
But there are other
technological innovations

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.100
as well.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.260
For example, something called
ECNs, electronic communications

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.340
networks.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.940
These are-- essentially, they
started out as bulletin boards,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.430
where large buyers and
sellers of equities

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.160
could come together
anonymously and transact

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.240
with each other at relatively
inexpensive prices.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.510
They can cut out the middleman
and reduce the bid offer spread

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.690
by hitting a transaction price
that was right in the middle.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.540
ECNs have grown tremendously
since the early, the mid 90s,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.790
when they started,
and now account

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.790
for a pretty significant
fraction of the volume.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.280
Electronic order routing,
electronic trading,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.660
all of these technologies have
caused this kind of increase

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.880
in the equity market trading
over the last several years.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.910
So today, as an
individual investor,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.760
you can trade much more quickly.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.910
You can trade much more cheaply.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.990
And you can trade much more
easily than ever before.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.440
So consumers have
benefited a great deal.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.750
Along the way, a number of
hedge funds and other investors

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.630
have ended up going out of
business because they have not

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.090
been able to compete
effectively with these kind

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.365
of technological innovations.

00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:02.590
And this is what I mentioned
last time, that technology

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.400
plays a very important role
in financial markets now,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.770
much more so than ever before.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.650
It used to be that it
mattered who you knew,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.220
rather than what you knew.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.790
That it was the old boys
network that mattered,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.609
instead of the computer network.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.359
And that the graduates
of Harvard and Yale

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:23.752
had an advantage over the
graduates of MIT and Caltech.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.210
That's been flipped
on its head now

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.376
over the last several years.

00:17:26.376 --> 00:17:31.270
It's what I call the revenge
of the nerds, which bodes well

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.306
for all of you.

00:17:32.306 --> 00:17:33.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:41.930
OK, so let me now turn to
the very first valuation

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.010
model that was ever
developed for equities.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.390
It couldn't be simpler.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.190
It's a model that
I think all of you

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.070
are going to
immediately understand,

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.750
and yet the
implications are going

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.380
to be really far-reaching
and profound.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.530
This is called the
Dividend Discount Model,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.320
and it starts with
the recognition

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.320
that, when you invest in a
company, what you're getting

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.230
for that piece of paper,
this common equity,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:14.120
you're getting the rights
to the flow of cash forever.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.050
And what kind of cash
are we talking about?

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.250
Well, we're talking
about dividends.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.890
So it's true that not
all stocks pay dividends,

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.000
but eventually you would figure
the stock will pay dividend

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.500
at some point, right?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.010
For years, Microsoft
never paid a dividend.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.670
But about, was it five
years ago or six years ago?

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.670
They announced that they're
starting to pay dividends.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:38.480
Why?

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.180
Because they had
accumulated so much cash

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.500
that they didn't have enough
things to invest that cash in,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.370
so they figured, let's give some
of it back to the investors.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.880
In their early days, they kept
every penny of their earnings

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.700
to reinvest, because they had
so many different opportunities

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.780
to take advantage of.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.660
But because they
became so mature

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.035
and they had already a
number of investment projects

00:19:02.035 --> 00:19:03.410
that were quite
valuable, and yet

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.332
were still generating
so much cash,

00:19:05.332 --> 00:19:07.290
they decided to return
some of it to investors.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.890
So at some point, you're
going to get dividends.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.200
And if a company never,
ever pays dividends,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.900
well, then, it should
be worth 0, right?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.210
If it pays you no cash
forever, then that

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.680
seems like a very bad asset.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.190
Yeah.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.064
AUDIENCE: What stops the
board of directors [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:22.064 --> 00:19:26.189
really depends on [INAUDIBLE]
issuing dividends [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:28.480
ANDREW LO: Well, first of
all, if they issued dividends

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.160
to pay themselves,
that's fine, as long

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.080
as they pay all the other
shareholders at the same time.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.630
So the answer is, in
principle, nothing stops them,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.930
but what makes them
decide against that

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.600
is if they have uses
for the cash other

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.310
than paying themselves.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.460
If, as a company, you have no
idea what to do with the money

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.530
you are generating,
well, first of all,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.180
that suggests that
maybe you're not

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.220
doing your job,
because as a company,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.770
you're supposed to be coming up
with valuable ways of earning

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.190
money for your investors.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.550
However, it may be that your
company is very mature, stable,

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.469
there's no growth,
there's nothing going on,

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:05.260
and all the cash that
you're generating you

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.490
don't know what to do with.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.830
In that case, you may very
well return all of that money

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.371
to investors.

00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:11.650
That's nothing wrong with that.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.950
The idea behind
having a vote though,

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.560
is that you want to make sure
that the board of directors,

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.770
who typically do own or are
responsible to shareholders

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.470
that own large blocks of shares,
will be deciding in the best

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.720
interests of the shareholders.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.090
And it could be that the best
interest of the shareholders

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.500
is to give them
back their money,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500
because we, the mature
company that we are,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.722
don't have any other
uses for the money.

00:20:33.722 --> 00:20:34.571
Yeah.

00:20:34.571 --> 00:20:36.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that, if the company never

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.622
pays dividends, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:39.622 --> 00:20:42.574
What about the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.341
Is there no value [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:45.840
ANDREW LO: Well,
but think about it.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.700
If a company keeps on
appreciating in value,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.180
but never pays out a dividend,
what's happening to the cash?

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.750
You know, when I say
never, I mean never.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.180
So I don't just mean like
in 10 years or in 20 years.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.440
I mean never.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.510
So can you think
of a company that

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.970
appreciates in
value all the time,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.890
but never, ever,
ever pays a dividend?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.690
There's no cash, so
you'll never get any cash.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.190
That's--

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.814
AUDIENCE: Well, then,
wouldn't you make a profit

00:21:10.814 --> 00:21:11.772
by selling [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:14.990
ANDREW LO: Oh, yes, you could
make a profit by selling,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.070
but if you sell a
security to somebody

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.370
else and they know for a
fact that it never, ever,

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.240
ever, ever pays any
money, well, then,

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.902
that's called a
Ponzi scheme, right?

00:21:28.902 --> 00:21:30.860
In other words, you're
selling a piece of paper

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.870
that's worthless to
somebody and hoping

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.350
that they are a bigger fool than
you are for having bought it.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.620
So when I say it never pays
any cash, I really mean it.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.010
If it never-- if you know
for sure that it never, ever

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:49.220
pays any cash, then it can't
be worth anything, right?

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.874
If you don't believe that,
then I have a piece of paper

00:21:51.874 --> 00:21:53.540
that I would like you
to take a look at,

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.320
and I would like
to sell you, OK?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.820
Yeah.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.214
AUDIENCE: Could it be like
coupons and, like, the company

00:21:59.214 --> 00:21:59.714
dissolves?

00:21:59.714 --> 00:22:00.560
ANDREW LO: What's that?

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.400
AUDIENCE: Even if it
never pays dividends,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.620
you could still
get something back

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.270
if the company
dissolves [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.600
ANDREW LO: Well, then
it does pay something.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.010
That's a liquidating dividend.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.230
Then that violates my
condition that it never, ever,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.720
ever pays anything, right?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.680
And that's the point.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.880
If the company is
growing and it has value,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.670
then you know for a
fact that either A,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.550
it will pay you a dividend
at some point, or B,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.200
if it doesn't and
it gets liquidated,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.700
then when it gets
liquidated, you'll

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.440
get a pro rata
share of whatever's

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.050
in the company, in which
case, that's a payment.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.160
So to say that a company
never, ever pays a dividend,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.750
I literally mean it will
never, ever pay anything, OK?

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.020
And in that case, it
can't be worth anything

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.480
if you know that.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.920
But if you can find somebody
who will buy it anyway,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.190
then that's an example
of an arbitrage.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.280
That's a free lunch.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.860
And so you can do that a lot if
you can find people like that.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.760
OK, so we're going to apply
the very basic principles

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.190
of present value analysis to a
security that pays dividends.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.300
So let's let the
price of a stock, Pt,

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.570
today, be given by that.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.350
Let Dt be the cash dividend
that gets paid at time t.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.860
And by the way, Dt could
be 0 for many, many years

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.020
and at some point become
positive, all right?

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.900
Dt can never be negative, right?

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.510
We're not talking about
taking money from investors.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.710
It pays either a
positive amount or 0.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.390
And I'm going to let E
sub t be the expectation

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.770
operator at time t.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.530
So now I'm going to
explicitly recognize

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.400
that these dividends are
not known in advance.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.750
Unlike bonds, where you
know the coupons in advance,

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.700
I don't know the
dividends in advance.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.950
So I'm going to have to guess.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.390
I'm going to have to make a
forecast as to what they are.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:24:00.170
And let me let r sub t be the
so-called risk-adjusted return

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.130
that is commensurate with the
risks of the dividends that

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.060
are there.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.700
I'm going to wave my
hands at this point

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.940
as to how we get the
dividend discount

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.210
return, the appropriate
risk-adjusted return,

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.770
but I'll come back to that in
a few lectures, when we go over

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.250
methods for determining the
appropriate risk adjustment,

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.790
OK?

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.250
But for now, let's
assume that we have it,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.110
and we get it from the
marketplace, right?

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.010
Just like we got the yield
from the marketplace,

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.070
it's a sum total of
everybody's fears,

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.230
expectations, hopes, and so on.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.780
So with these
components defined,

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.430
I'm now going to simply write
the price of my instrument

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.834
as this value function of
the future cash flows, right?

00:24:50.834 --> 00:24:52.250
That's the most
general expression

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.160
we started with on day one.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:00.350
And given what we now know about
present value and valuing cash

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.970
flows that come in the future,
it's not a big leap of faith

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.350
to put some structure on
this valuation operator, OK?

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:14.230
The value of this sequence
of future cash flows

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.950
is simply equal to the
expectation today, time t,

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:25.320
of future dividends out
into the infinite future,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.260
discounted back by the
appropriate risk-adjusted rate

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.650
of return.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.450
Now you'll notice that the
rate of return, this r, I

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:41.400
put a subscript, t, plus
1, and t plus 2, and so on.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.640
I'm explicitly
recognizing the fact

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.460
that the appropriate
risk-adjustment changes

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.330
over time as market
conditions change

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:57.640
and as the business changes, OK?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.600
So it could be that the
risk-adjusted return

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.610
for a one-year
cash flow is this,

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.000
but the risk-adjusted return
for a two-year cash flow

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.320
is different.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.190
Just like we have a yield
curve for riskless bonds,

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:20.460
we may have a yield curve
for risky cash flows, OK?

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.380
And if I really wanted
to be a masochist when

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.840
it comes to notation,
what I could do

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.480
is to have a double
subscript that

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.160
says that this is the
appropriate risk-adjusted

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.790
return between years
t and t plus 1,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.390
and then this is between
years t and t plus 2,

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:44.520
and so on, because these
discount rates may be

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.830
completely different tomorrow.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.530
In other words,
tomorrow's discount rate

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:54.390
for a one-year cash flow may be
different than today's discount

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.080
rate for a one-year
cash flow, right?

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.810
So I can have a whole string
of discount rates for today,

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.440
and a completely different
string of discount rates

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.040
for tomorrow and for
every day in the future.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.530
These things change
all the time.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.890
I think you'll see now why I
told you earlier equities is

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.220
a lot more complicated than
fixed income instruments.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.250
It's because there are two
sources of uncertainty.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:31.690
One is the discount rate, and
the other is the cash flows.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.390
And moreover, the discount
rate that we're talking about,

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.850
it's not the risk-free
discount rate,

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.430
but it's the risk-adjusted
discount rate.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.180
And if risks change over
time, as certainly they

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.300
have over the past
even few days,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.620
then the discount
rate should change.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.860
So in addition to
the term structure

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.680
effect of different
yields, we also

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.520
have the risk effect of looking
out into the future, given

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.830
current market conditions.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.100
So while this
expression is tidy,

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.050
and it looks nice
and clean, in order

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.150
to turn this into
an actual number

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.884
that you can look
at and decide, gee,

00:28:10.884 --> 00:28:12.300
do I want to invest
in this stock?

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.640
Is it undervalued or overvalued?

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.890
It's going to take
a lot of work.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.950
So before we get to
that work, I want

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.730
to spend some time thinking
about simpler things,

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.360
and try to come up with
relatively simple implications

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.750
of this relatively robust model.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.527
Question?

00:28:30.527 --> 00:28:31.461
AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:34.263
Does rt take into
account the riskiness

00:28:34.263 --> 00:28:38.120
of the company itself, or
is it of the marketplace?

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.391
ANDREW LO: The answer is yes.

00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:41.810
It's both.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.000
It's the riskiness
of the company,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.940
as well as the riskiness
of the aggregate set

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.040
of market conditions.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.640
It's both.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.620
And so we have to figure
out how that factors

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.364
into this equation.

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:55.530
That's going to take us a
few lectures to get there.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.310
But the answer is both.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.960
Yeah.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.460
AUDIENCE: Would you
say it's related

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.800
to the riskiness of the
expectation of the dividend

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.362
being whatever it is at time t?

00:29:06.362 --> 00:29:07.070
ANDREW LO: Well--

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.920
AUDIENCE: If I were to know that
the first dividend is absolute

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.750
certain, but after
that, not so much,

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.470
then could I replace rt
with a risk-free rate,

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:22.640
but rt plus 2 with something
else, and so forth?

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.670
ANDREW LO: Yes, assuming
that that dividend really

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.630
was risk-free.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.220
Yes, that's right.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.680
So the idea behind
the discount rate--

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.460
and, by the way, I'm going to
ask you to explain this to me.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.050
So I'm going to
make a statement,

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.540
and then I'm going to ask
you to justify it, OK?

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.010
The statement is this--

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:44.240
the discount rate that's used
in the denominator of each

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.670
of these fractions,
that discount rate

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.420
has to be risk-adjusted
in a way to reflect

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.710
the risks of the numerator,
as well as general market

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:56.530
conditions.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.860
It has to be commensurate
with the risks

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.720
of that particular numerator.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.270
So if this numerator is much
less risky than this numerator,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.370
I would argue that
you would have

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.590
to use a different
discount rate, one

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.530
that's higher for the
more risky numerator

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.240
than for the less risky.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.780
Now justify that for me.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.087
Why is that a reasonable
thing to want to do?

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:23.587
Yeah.

00:30:23.587 --> 00:30:26.128
AUDIENCE: Because you're getting
more return on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.310
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.620
AUDIENCE: Your discount
rate would be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.619
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:30:32.619 --> 00:30:34.110
You get more return
on your capital

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.240
for something of
greater risk on average,

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.694
because you've got to be
rewarded for bearing that risk.

00:30:38.694 --> 00:30:40.110
And if you're not
rewarded, you're

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.120
not going to take on that risk.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.020
How do you know that?

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.061
How do you know that you're
going to get rewarded

00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.370
for taking on that risk?

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.554
Where did you get
that from, besides me?

00:30:50.554 --> 00:30:52.970
AUDIENCE: That's just the law
of the jungle, I don't know.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.680
ANDREW LO: You're right.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.940
It's a law of the jungle.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.765
But in this case,
what is the jungle?

00:30:58.765 --> 00:30:59.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.889
ANDREW LO: Exactly, thank you.

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:01.800
The market.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.790
Excellent.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.360
The market.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.420
The market is the
jungle from which you

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.680
compete for scarce resources.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.970
And in order to get
your pet project funded,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.550
you've got to provide the
right incentives for people

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.200
to buy into your project.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.410
So that's the logic
of the justification.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.290
Now let me go one
step farther and say,

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.560
suppose that you want to
replicate these cash flows.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.180
Suppose that you want to create
a portfolio that gives you

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.080
these kind of cash flows.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.370
Well, then, you've got
to go to the marketplace

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.340
and figure out what the
appropriate opportunity cost is

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.045
for each of those cash flows
and then discount them,

00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:43.420
because that's
what the market is

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.560
charging for those cash flows.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.940
So that's why you have to
get the appropriate discount

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.440
rate matched to the appropriate
cash flow, all right?

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.490
It comes straight out of what
we learned about bond pricing,

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.670
but now we're adding an
extra dimension-- risk.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.430
And I'm not going to be able
to talk about it in any more

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.490
detail than this until we put
more quantitative structure

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.110
on what we even mean by risk.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.570
I mean, you all take for
granted, when I say risk,

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.370
you say, yes, you
understand what risk is.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.350
But in order for us to justify
a particular expression for how

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.660
to make that kind
of adjustment, we

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.370
have to be very specific
about how to measure risk.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.740
So in about three
or four lectures,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.830
I'm going to actually propose
a method for measuring risk.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.720
And once we have
that method in hand,

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.680
we can then make that
risk adjustment extremely

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.280
explicitly.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.620
I'm going to give you a
formula that you can actually

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.860
compute in an Excel spreadsheet
that will tell you exactly

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:43.540
whether the number should
be 6.5% or 7.3% or 8.9%.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.163
You're going to actually
see how to do that yourself.

00:32:46.163 --> 00:32:47.462
Yeah.

00:32:47.462 --> 00:32:48.980
AUDIENCE: The score
wasn't implying

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.296
that those time structured
to when dividends paid out.

00:32:52.296 --> 00:32:55.382
Like, the time between
t plus 1 and t plus 2

00:32:55.382 --> 00:32:57.590
doesn't have to be the same
as t plus 2 and t plus 3.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.090
ANDREW LO: Correct, correct.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.350
It doesn't have to be the same.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.670
And if it's not the same,
then the difference in horizon

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.840
should be reflected by the
implicit size of that discount

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.500
rate.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.097
Yeah.

00:33:11.097 --> 00:33:14.031
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the company's bond yield

00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:17.460
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.850
ANDREW LO: Well, you tell me.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.290
Can we use the
company's bond yield

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.040
to use as a discount
rate for the equity?

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.130
Well, that depends.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.700
It depends on whether or
not the equity and the bond

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.730
are of comparable risk, right?

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.400
Remember, it's not
the company that

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.230
determines the discount rate.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.520
It's not the company--

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.640
or rather, it's not
determined by fiat,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.270
or by announcement of a
company's particular policies.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.260
What determines the
yield is the riskiness

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.340
of that yield and
the marketplace.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.120
The market determines
that particular price,

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.290
not the individual, or not
the sources of those funds.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.820
AUDIENCE: Whenever [INAUDIBLE]
of the company's bonds

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.254
do not reflect on
the company's equity?

00:34:06.254 --> 00:34:07.670
ANDREW LO: Oh, of
course, they do,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.380
but they reflect in
a very specific way,

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.340
and we're going to
talk about that when

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.840
we get into capital structure.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.790
Companies that have
very high leverage

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.889
are going to have more
risky equity than companies

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.600
with very low leverage.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.719
So the leverage does have
an impact on the equity.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.699
We're going to come to
that in a little while.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.157
There is a
relationship, all right?

00:34:24.157 --> 00:34:27.440
But for now, let's look at
these securities in isolation

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.790
and not worry about it.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.739
And I'm going to keep
coming back to the idea

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:34.219
that it's not the company that
gets to determine the discount

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.770
rate, but rather it's
the company's riskiness--

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.949
or rather the riskiness of the
cash flows and the market's

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.860
assessment of the cost
of that riskiness--

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.570
that determines
the interest rate.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.900
A few years ago, there
was a faculty member

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.550
at Carnegie Mellon
who won a Nobel Prize,

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.600
and it ended up that he
was one of the highest paid

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.300
professors at the time.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.080
And so he was being interviewed
by the school newspaper,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.047
and they said,
Professor So and So,

00:35:07.047 --> 00:35:09.130
do you think it's appropriate
that even though you

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.850
won a Nobel Prize,
that you should get

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.330
paid twice as much as some
of the other faculty who

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.420
are Nobel Prize-winning
physicists and fields medalists

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.840
in the Mathematics
department, and so on?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.740
I mean, do you think it's
fair that your salary is twice

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.180
as high as other
people in the school?

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:36.030
And the faculty member, who is
an economist, said, listen son.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.490
The university does not
determine my equilibrium

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.510
salary.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.600
They only determine
what city I work in.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.330
In other words, the
salary of an individual

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.290
is not determined by that
particular institution.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.250
It's determined by
the marketplace.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.082
The marketplace bids
on that faculty member,

00:35:53.082 --> 00:35:54.540
and the highest
bidder, presumably,

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.850
will be able to get
that faculty member.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.040
The same thing with
these cash flows.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.246
It's not the company's
debt, or the company's

00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:02.620
weighted average
cost of capital,

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.450
which we don't know
what it is yet,

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.380
but I'll define a
little later on.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.200
It's not the company
that gets to choose

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.580
what the discount rate is.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.900
The question is, given the
riskiness of that cash flow,

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.040
what does the market tell me
is the fair rate of return

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.090
for that cash flow?

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.600
That's the number I want to
plug into that denominator.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.650
Yeah, question.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.450
AUDIENCE: The market may
determine the discount rate,

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.697
but the company determines the
growth rate on the dividend,

00:36:28.697 --> 00:36:29.196
right?

00:36:29.196 --> 00:36:31.380
They get to decide
what the dividend is.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.150
ANDREW LO: Well,
they get to decide

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.160
what the dividend is
subject to their ability

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.467
to pay that dividend.

00:36:36.467 --> 00:36:38.550
But if it turns out that
they make a bad decision,

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.630
and they pay out
all the dividends,

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.421
and they have no more
money, and they can't

00:36:41.421 --> 00:36:43.260
grow the company
anymore, then who

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.660
determines what's worth what?

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.320
Ultimately, the market.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.730
The market is the final arbiter
in all of these calculations.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.950
At least that's the
theory of finance.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:58.670
That's the basic, plain
vanilla, frictionless model, OK?

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:02.120
It's the market that determines
these interest rates.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.340
Later on, after we
go through the basics

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.380
and you understand the
frictionless model,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.030
I'm going to
introduce frictions,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.810
and then you'll see what
impact corporate policies have

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.010
on these implications.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.110
In some cases,
corporate directors

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:19.580
can actually do a lot of harm
by making suboptimal decisions

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.510
that go against the market.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.320
In other cases, you could argue
that corporate decision-makers

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.120
know more than
the market and are

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.330
able to make bets that the
market is not capable of doing.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.340
That's certainly possible,
because who knows

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.110
the company better than you do?

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:37.130
Although a market
expert would say

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.650
it's not knowing the
company that will determine

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.300
the value of the company.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.400
It's knowing how
that company compares

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.019
to all the other companies that
are out there that determines

00:37:46.019 --> 00:37:47.060
the value of the company.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.980
And you, as the
corporate insider,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.720
may know your
business very well,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.370
but you don't know
how you stack up

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.250
against the 25 other
businesses in your industry,

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.110
and we, the market, know better
than you, the individual.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.720
That's the argument that
would be made against that.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.700
AUDIENCE: In the case
of refinanced stocks,

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.887
can I use the same formula?

00:38:04.887 --> 00:38:06.470
ANDREW LO: We're
going to get to that.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:07.730
We're going to talk
about preferred stocks.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.080
That's a separate issue.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.000
Preferred stocks have a
different priority of claim,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.290
and that's going to require
some slightly different

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:16.995
modifications to this formula.

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:17.529
Yeah.

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:19.820
AUDIENCE: So I had a question
about the expected value.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.090
So yesterday in the example,
you discounted the 1,000 to 900

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.455
[INAUDIBLE] Et.

00:38:25.455 --> 00:38:28.991
So what else do you need
to discount in the r

00:38:28.991 --> 00:38:30.860
to account for the risk?

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.480
ANDREW LO: Well,
I mean, you have

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.170
to take into account the fact
that there are other competing

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.060
opportunities for this
particular project

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.450
in the marketplace.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.630
And so it's not just the
risk of this project,

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.030
but rather how the
risk of this project

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:48.260
stacks up against the risks
of all other possible projects

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.040
that you would be competing
for in the open market.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.290
Let me put it to you this way.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.300
Let's do a simple
thought experiment.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.090
Suppose that instead of
these as being dividend

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:03.740
streams for a given company,
let's do the following thought

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.890
experiment.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.860
Let's imagine doing a strip, OK?

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.660
You all know what
strips are now, right?

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.090
So let's think about
stripping out dividends, OK?

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.070
It's a very weird thought
experiment, granted,

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.520
but just bear with me.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.760
Let's suppose that
instead of one company,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.290
I generate an
infinity of companies.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:25.820
Each company lives only
for one dividend payment,

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.530
after which it gets liquidated.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:32.370
So each of these cash
flows, Dt plus 1, Dt plus 2,

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.760
each one of these things is
a separate and independent

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.220
company that gets
liquidated right

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:42.070
after it pays the dividend, OK?

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.910
Now how would you
value a portfolio

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.240
of all of these companies?

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.400
Well, you would do this, right?

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.550
For each company,
you would figure out

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.956
what the appropriate
discount rate is,

00:39:56.956 --> 00:39:58.330
and the appropriate
discount rate

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.210
reflects not just the
time value of money,

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:06.470
but the appropriate
riskiness of that cash flow.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.875
For example, if I took
that company-- let's

00:40:08.875 --> 00:40:11.000
actually do a thought
experiment of how we do that.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.400
Let's go through
the motions, OK.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.160
I've got a piece of
paper that is something

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:22.490
that funds nanotechnology in
a very specific application.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.910
And this company
is going to require

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.190
a certain amount of
investment, and then it'll

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:34.250
pay off all of its
earnings in 2013, December,

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.680
and then it'll liquidate
and be done with, OK?

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.700
That's the company.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.830
How do I figure out the
price of the company today?

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.770
Anybody?

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.670
How do I figure out the price?

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.630
I have this piece of
paper that says in 2013,

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.569
the company will
liquidate, and I

00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:57.860
want to know what the price is.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.490
What's the first thing you
would do with that proposal

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.914
if you got it in the mail?

00:41:02.914 --> 00:41:04.080
What would you want to know?

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.600
Yeah.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.599
AUDIENCE: I would want
to know, like, if there's

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:08.058
a security I can
buy in the market,

00:41:08.058 --> 00:41:09.515
is the company
going to pay for it?

00:41:09.515 --> 00:41:11.390
Because it's the same
risk return profile.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.190
And I look at the
marketplace for that.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.210
ANDREW LO: Why
would you do that?

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.668
AUDIENCE: Because
there's no reason

00:41:15.668 --> 00:41:19.400
I would go through the hassle,
or friction, as you call it,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.110
of pricing a new
company if I could just

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.340
go online and buy it.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.990
ANDREW LO: Right,
that's one logic,

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:29.282
but another logic is that you
have money looking for a home.

00:41:29.282 --> 00:41:30.740
You can put it in
this new venture,

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.900
or you can put it in
this existing company.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.696
And if they're
comparable, then at least

00:41:34.696 --> 00:41:36.320
you have some sense
of what it's worth.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.940
Exactly.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.740
In order to figure
out whether or not

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.960
you can get a
comparable security,

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.150
you need to know what the cash
flow is for that nanotechnology

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.210
startup, right?

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:50.000
So you might think first about
estimating the expected cash

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.610
flow in the liquidating
dividend in 2013.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:59.650
OK, so you calculate the
numerator, all right?

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.600
And you find a company
out there that has

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.730
that same kind of cash flow.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.070
You have to find one that
has the same profile,

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:10.900
so it does it in 2013, at
which point it gets liquidated.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.190
But let's even forget about--

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.080
suppose we didn't
have such a company.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.280
Suppose we didn't have
an existing security.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.270
So this is literally
a fresh start.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.490
You've got a piece of
paper that gives you

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.330
the claim to a company that
liquidates in 2013 with one

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:26.680
cash flow only.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.870
And now you've estimated
that cash flow to be

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:34.750
approximately $27 million, OK?

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.570
So now you've got the numerator.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.987
A piece of paper that
pays $27 million.

00:42:39.987 --> 00:42:41.320
How do you figure out its price?

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.990
What would you do?

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.520
Yeah.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.335
AUDIENCE: Calculate the risk
that it's going to [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:50.335 --> 00:42:52.930
also you have the
time [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.430
ANDREW LO: OK, and
you've done that,

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:55.360
and that's the $27 million.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.151
AUDIENCE: That's included
in the valuation.

00:42:57.151 --> 00:42:58.720
ANDREW LO: Right,
the $27 million

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.290
includes the probability
that it actually is 0,

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.710
so the expected
value is 27 million.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.693
How would you go about-- yeah.

00:43:07.693 --> 00:43:09.818
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
actually be two [INAUDIBLE],,

00:43:09.818 --> 00:43:12.188
so when the 27
million liquidates,

00:43:12.188 --> 00:43:14.895
you get the value of the assets?

00:43:14.895 --> 00:43:17.647
ANDREW LO: The liquidation value
is the 27 million on average.

00:43:17.647 --> 00:43:19.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
two payments for that.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.396
ANDREW LO: No, no, no,
it's just one payment--

00:43:21.396 --> 00:43:23.110
27 million on expectation.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.670
Oh, it may be two possibilities.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:28.900
Maybe you either get 54
million with 50% probability,

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.360
or nothing with 50%
probability, so the expectation

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.001
is 27 million.

00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:34.750
What would you do?

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.960
Yeah.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.418
AUDIENCE: I think
if you're already

00:43:36.418 --> 00:43:41.800
weighted in the probability
[INAUDIBLE] 0 [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.720
ANDREW LO: Suppose you
don't know what to use.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.819
Suppose you want to figure
out what the price is.

00:43:45.819 --> 00:43:47.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] discount.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.910
ANDREW LO: Yeah, I
know what you mean.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.990
But suppose that you
didn't have that.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.957
What would you do?

00:43:51.957 --> 00:43:56.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
at the yield curve just

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.080
to get an idea of
what in 2010, at least

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.582
either a risk-free
security or a security

00:44:03.582 --> 00:44:06.700
with that same credit risk.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.160
You know, what discount
rate that would go in there,

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.500
discounting by that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.420
ANDREW LO: You could
do that, but now we're

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.836
getting more and
more complicated.

00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:16.750
Isn't there an easier way to
figure out what the price is?

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:17.500
Exactly.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.270
You know, let's let
the market decide.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.730
Auction it off.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:24.460
Now when you auction it off, you
take the highest bidder, right?

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.606
And you get a number.

00:44:25.606 --> 00:44:26.980
I don't know what
that number is,

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.970
but let's just say the number
is, I don't know, 15 million.

00:44:32.485 --> 00:44:34.610
You've got somebody who's
willing to pay 15 million

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:39.740
today for a cash flow that
gives them expected 27 million

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.180
in 2013.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:49.160
With those two numbers, that
gives you r, doesn't it?

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.170
That's how r is established.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.030
It's established
the exact same way

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.540
that we establish r
for riskless bonds.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.160
The way that US
treasuries ended up

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.280
being three basis points
on September 18th was,

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.680
basically, tons of people
wanted to buy these securities,

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.920
bidding down the yield
and bidding up the price.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.160
So if we had this piece of
paper that paid only one

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.580
dividend in 2013 and
we auctioned it off,

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.870
we would get a yield.

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:17.694
The yield would be a
risk-adjusted yield.

00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:19.610
I don't know how the
risk adjustment got made.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.831
So you could be quite right that
you take the risk-free yield,

00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:24.580
and you add on top of
that a credit spread

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.060
and who knows what.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.430
The point is, the market
did it for us, OK?

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:32.010
So what I'm getting
after with this formula

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:37.590
is I want to use those discount
rates that are determined

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.240
by the marketplace.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.880
Because if ever I have
to sell my company,

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.380
if ever I have to
take this company

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.452
and break it apart
and get rid of it,

00:45:45.452 --> 00:45:47.160
and the market is
going to pay me for it,

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.140
the way that the market
is going to evaluate

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.830
the different pieces is just
the way that I described.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.260
It'll look at each cash flow,
look at how risky it is,

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.370
look at the opportunity
cost of other investments

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:00.360
that they can get the same
risk return profile for,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.780
and they'll pay that amount,
which will implicitly

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.720
give me the appropriate yield.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.442
Yeah.

00:46:07.442 --> 00:46:09.150
AUDIENCE: So let's
say that me purchasing

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.810
a stock with this
calculation, do

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.832
I have to assume that
this calculation is wrong?

00:46:14.832 --> 00:46:16.790
Because why would I pay
out money for something

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:21.340
that's going to be exactly the
same, kind of discounted, cash

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.964
flow back to right now?

00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:24.380
ANDREW LO: So
that's a good point.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.550
Let me repeat the question.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.844
The question's why-- in order
for you to buy the stock,

00:46:27.844 --> 00:46:29.260
would you have to
assume that this

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.260
is wrong, or rather, that
the market price is not

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.130
equal to this?

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.721
Well, the answer is
no, you don't have to.

00:46:37.721 --> 00:46:40.220
Although if you did, that would
provide a motivation for you

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.200
to want to do that.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.680
But it could be that you
simply want the risk and reward

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.230
of this particular cash flow.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.940
What's wrong with that?

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.640
Suppose that the security
is fairly priced.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.680
So this equation
at the very bottom

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.900
says that the price
of the security

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.350
is equal to the present value
of all the future expected

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:06.320
cash flows discounted at
the fair rate of return.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.180
That's a perfectly
reasonable thing

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.800
for somebody to
want to invest in,

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.210
if they like that kind of
risk/reward combination.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.360
So some people want to
put their money in Google,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.510
and some people want to
put their money in IBM,

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.654
and some people want to put
their money in US Steel.

00:47:23.654 --> 00:47:25.070
Those are different
companies that

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.200
have different rates
of return based

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.230
upon their different
risks and cash flows,

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.970
and even if those things
are fairly priced,

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.550
it's not like you're
going to make no money.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.180
You're going to make money
based upon the fair market rate

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.460
of return for that security.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.220
Now if you think you've
got a better mousetrap,

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.950
and you can identify
mispriced securities,

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:52.340
that gives you a whole
another reason for investing.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.980
But even without
any mistakes being

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.892
made, even with if market
prices are perfectly fair,

00:47:58.892 --> 00:48:00.350
people want to
invest, because they

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:03.320
want the return that
those kind of investments

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.170
give them, right?

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:10.460
OK, so let's consider
some simple cases.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.010
In order for us to really make
use of this formula, which

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.720
at this level of generality
really is useless,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.010
let's try to simplify
and see what we get.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:21.890
And we're going to
simplify in the ways

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:23.180
that we've done before.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:29.100
Let's assume that dividends
are fixed throughout time,

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:33.050
and given by a number D, OK?

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:37.140
And let's assume that the
risks don't change over time

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.130
and are given by
a discount rate r.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:48.800
Well, if you fix D and you
fix r, magically, what you get

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.440
is that the price
of the security

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.820
is equal to our old friend, the
perpetuity formula, D over r,

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.650
OK?

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.180
Not that surprising.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.460
If you have a constant
stream of dividends,

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.420
with a constant discount
rate, then the price

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.200
is equal to D over r.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.500
Now, again, this may seem
totally trivial to you,

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.490
but it does provide a very
interesting observation.

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:16.340
Number one, the
price of common stock

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.910
is an increasing function
of the expected cash

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.410
flows in the form
of future dividends.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:26.630
So if you expect there to be
higher dividends going forward,

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.160
the price should
go up, and if you

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.500
expect lower dividends
going forward,

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.590
the price should go down.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.122
So that's a nice insight.

00:49:33.122 --> 00:49:35.330
Another insight, though, is
that the price of a stock

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:39.390
is inversely proportional
to its discount rate.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.140
If interest rates
go up in general,

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.420
if interest rates
go up, what should

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.568
happen to the stock price?

00:49:46.568 --> 00:49:47.456
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:47.456 --> 00:49:48.940
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
it should go down.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.606
There are two ways
of thinking about it.

00:49:50.606 --> 00:49:53.680
One is that future
cash flows are

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.490
going to have to be
discounted at a higher price.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:00.190
Or two, the demand
for stocks will not

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:04.060
be as great, because now the
opportunity for earning higher

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.570
return exists in other
securities like bonds,

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.790
and so that will reduce
the demand for stocks

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:14.460
and the price will
come down, right?

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.630
So that's a very
nice model, but we

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:19.970
can make it a little
bit nicer by allowing

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:21.350
the dividends to grow.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.750
So now suppose you have a
growth company, a company

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:27.230
where the dividends are
expected to grow at a rate of g

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.830
every period.

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:32.870
Well, then, once again, we have
our old friend, the perpetuity,

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.420
with growing coupons, right?

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:39.170
D over r minus g.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.580
And now, as I think I
alluded to early on when

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:47.030
we went through this formula, we
have in this very, very simple

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:52.210
expression one explanation
for the technology

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:59.040
bubble, both how it got so big,
and secondly, how it burst.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:04.750
If r is close to g, if the
growth rate is very large,

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.040
you're going to get
a very big price.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:13.520
And if there are rapid changes
in what people expect g to be,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.890
or what people
estimate g to be, you

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.880
can get very rapid shocks
in the level of prices,

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:25.720
including price one-ups
and then crashes, right?

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.320
Yeah.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.900
AUDIENCE: What kind of confuses
me is that, I mean, yeah,

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.130
so is r greater than g?

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.010
And r greater than
g is necessary

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.190
in order to get that
[INAUDIBLE] efficient.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:39.630
But is there any
more meaning to that,

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.221
or is this just a
mathematical thing?

00:51:41.221 --> 00:51:42.720
ANDREW LO: There
is meaning to that.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.580
The meaning is
actually quite simple,

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.260
and we alluded to
it when we first

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.880
went through this formula.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.030
Suppose that r were
not greater than g.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.854
Suppose r were less than g.

00:51:53.854 --> 00:51:57.280
What that's telling you
is that the rate of growth

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.160
of this security, or this
cash flow, or this dividend,

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.350
the rate of growth is much
faster than the interest rate,

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:06.400
all right?

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.990
So you've got wealth that's
growing over time faster

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:14.950
than the interest rate, which
means that if it really is true

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.740
that it'll last out
into perpetuity, then

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.590
in very short order you
should become bigger

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:24.065
than the entire
planet's GDP, right?

00:52:24.065 --> 00:52:26.440
Because you're going to be
bigger than the interest rate.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.050
So the rate at which
assets in the future

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.540
are being deflated
to the present

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.610
is actually less
than the rate of what

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.260
you're growing your wealth.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.860
Pretty soon, you're going to
become richer than God himself,

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.500
and we know that
that can't happen.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.708
AUDIENCE: But isn't it that--

00:52:42.708 --> 00:52:45.970
I mean, so right now,
the inflation rate

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.220
is greater than the interest
rate, for example, right?

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.564
ANDREW LO: That's right now.

00:52:49.564 --> 00:52:51.730
That's right now, but this
is out of the perpetuity.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:53.334
Do you believe that
that's sustainable

00:52:53.334 --> 00:52:54.250
out of the perpetuity?

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:54.819
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:54.819 --> 00:52:56.860
ANDREW LO: Well, then,
this formula doesn't work.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:01.240
This formula is a formula
that's predicated on infinity,

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.872
not 10 years, not 20 years.

00:53:03.872 --> 00:53:05.830
As we mentioned, when we
went over the formula,

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:11.180
China has been growing at a rate
of 10% for the last 15 years.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.720
Do you think 10% growth
rate is sustainable?

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.504
If China continues
to grow at 10%,

00:53:16.504 --> 00:53:18.670
pretty soon we're all going
to be speaking Mandarin.

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:22.750
I mean, it's just not
possible for a country

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:26.020
to both be reasonably-sized
and not totally dominant,

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.940
and to have a rate
of growth so much

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.160
larger than what
can be sustained

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.860
over a long period of time.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.160
And so that's the key.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.430
This is a formula
that's about infinity.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.160
It's not about five
years or 10 years.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.800
OK, another question.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.100
No.

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:45.630
OK, so in this case,
the Gordon growth model

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:48.630
allows us to get an
expression that tells us

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:52.320
if there are very,
very significant growth

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.810
opportunities that
can actually push up

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.450
the price of a
stock dramatically.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.750
If somehow all of us decide that
those growth opportunities no

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:04.620
longer exist because we have
new information, then boom,

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.600
it disappears, OK?

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.850
A good example of
this is cold fusion.

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.540
I don't know how many of you
remember, 15 or 20 years ago,

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.820
there was a big controversy
about the Pons and Fleischmann

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.760
experiment, where they did
an experiment where it seemed

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.520
like they generated heat,
but heat not from a chemical

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.250
reaction, but from
a nuclear reaction

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:26.890
in a standard
laboratory setting.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:30.580
And typically, you need
very, very unusual conditions

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.610
to generate thermonuclear
reactions that

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.320
can create that kind of heat.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:40.780
Now in the end, they were
discredited and, apparently,

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.750
although there's still
controversy out there,

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.180
it doesn't seem like it
was a nuclear reaction.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.880
But if it were, if it
was possible to generate

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.830
a nuclear reaction at room
temperature, what that could

00:54:55.830 --> 00:55:00.550
have meant is that
it would eliminate

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.770
all of the energy
problems of the world,

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:06.580
because you'd be able to
run your car on tap water.

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.550
And the amount of energy
in an ounce of tap water

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:13.100
is enough to fuel your
car for about a year.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.320
So think about it.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:19.176
If that technology really
worked to have worked out,

00:55:19.176 --> 00:55:21.050
what do you think the
value of that would be?

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:23.150
What's the g in that case?

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.550
And you can
understand why people

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:29.960
would have invested hundreds
of billions of dollars

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.550
into that kind of
an opportunity,

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:34.730
if it were, in fact,
a real opportunity.

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:37.820
There was a short time
where we didn't know,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.740
and during that time, r
minus g looked pretty small.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.230
g looked big relative
to r, all right.

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:49.190
And so that created
very, very large swings

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:52.599
in prices of both
traditional energy companies

00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:53.390
like oil companies.

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:55.730
You can imagine what oil
companies would be worth

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.820
if we figured out how to
run cars on water, right?

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:03.470
That would maybe be justifiable
in light of how much they've

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.220
made over the years.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.570
But the point is that it
creates enormous opportunity

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:12.080
and potential dislocation
so that the expectations

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.240
of the market matter a
great deal, and this is why.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.520
This is how it actually
gets incorporated.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.820
Now I'm going to
take that equation

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:23.030
and turn it around,
turn it on its head,

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.490
and it'll give us
another insight into how

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:32.720
to think about the discount rate
and the value of corporations.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.980
If the price of a stock today
is given by D over r minus g,

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:42.620
then I can flip things
around and say that r minus g

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.990
is equal to D over P, right?

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:52.910
The dividend price ratio is
equal to r minus g, or r--

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:56.690
the discount rate that I'm
using for the cash flows--

00:56:56.690 --> 00:57:02.330
is given by the dividend
yield plus the rate of growth

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:08.440
implicit in that company's
investment opportunity set.

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.920
Now why is this interesting?

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.160
Well, in order for
you to understand

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.080
the importance of
this expression,

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.230
you have to realize
that, for many years,

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:21.580
stock analysts would look
at a company's discount rate

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:26.600
or cost of capital by simply
using the dividend yield.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.470
So in the exact same way
that if you have a bond,

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:32.320
and you see what the coupons
are, and you take the coupon

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.810
and divide it by the
price, that gives you

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:39.160
a sense of what your rate of
return is over a given period.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.650
When you look at a stock, and
you want to ask the question,

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:43.390
how much am I earning
on that stock?

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:46.000
What is the rate of return
on that stock for me,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.130
the investor?

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.550
You take the dividends that
you get paid every quarter,

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:50.650
and you take that
dividend and you divide it

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:52.060
by the stock price,
and that gives you

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.170
a sort of rate of return, right?

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.545
Because if you
think about buying

00:57:54.545 --> 00:57:58.210
the stock for a price, P, and
then getting cash flows of D

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:01.540
every quarter, or every
period, then your yield,

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.180
your rate of
return, is D over P.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:09.010
That's called the dividend
price ratio, or dividend yield.

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.140
What this expression
says is something

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.430
that every MIT graduate knows
in his or her heart, which

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:19.180
is that technology
adds value above

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.270
and beyond what you observe
in current cash flows.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:26.080
It's not just the dividend
that gives a company value,

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.720
it's the ability for
companies to grow over time.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:32.320
It's not just the company's
current plant and equipment

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.420
and operations
that give it value,

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:38.530
it is all of the interesting,
wonderful, innovative, creative

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:41.440
ideas that are locked
up in that company that

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.480
may one day be
implemented and allow

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.660
it to grow far beyond the
founders' wildest dreams.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.150
That also has to be factored
into the rate of return

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.540
of the company.

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:54.220
And this simple little dividend
yield model tells us this.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.130
It says that the
required rate of return,

00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:00.320
the risk-adjusted discount rate,
the cost of capital, the user

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.750
cost, whatever you want
to call it, this r,

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.290
has two pieces to it.

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:10.140
One is the cash that you get on
a regular basis, the dividends

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:13.600
that the current
operations generate,

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:21.770
plus the growth opportunities
of those dividends

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:25.680
out into the
infinite future, OK?

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.180
Now remember, the way that
we structured this dividend

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.140
payment, the way that we
had our formula set up,

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.090
the dividends are the
dividends that get

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.400
paid next period, right?

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.290
If you go back and
look at the formula,

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:45.590
this is the price
today, and it's

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:49.280
given by the dividends
paid at time t plus 1.

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.160
So this price that I'm
using in my notation

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.850
is the current
ex-dividend price,

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:59.740
meaning this period's dividend
has been paid already,

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:02.710
and now the value to
this piece of paper

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:08.950
is the future dividend,
starting next period, t plus 1.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:15.290
So when I say D is
fixed, it's fixed,

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:19.460
but it's getting
paid next period, OK?

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:23.660
So in this expression,
this D is actually

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.460
next period's dividend.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.530
But remember that
when I'm trying

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:32.700
to value the company today,
I don't observe next period's

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.040
dividend, which is random,
but I know how much was just

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.270
paid in the most recent period.

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.677
So if I want to use
D, and there's growth,

01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:44.260
I actually have to take the most
recent dividend, the one that

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.890
just got paid, and
multiply that by 1 plus g

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:51.400
to get the value of
next period's dividend.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.516
So that's why this
expression I've corrected--

01:00:55.516 --> 01:00:56.890
not corrected,
it's not that it's

01:00:56.890 --> 01:01:00.880
wrong-- it's just I've changed
the expression so that it

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.680
is D sub 0, which is the most
recent dividend that was just

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.010
paid multiplied by 1
plus g divided by P.

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:11.950
So I just do that--

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:13.950
if you want to use this
formula, and by the way,

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:15.750
you can actually go
out and use this now.

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:17.458
I would actually
encourage you to use it.

01:01:17.458 --> 01:01:19.590
Go out and take a look
at your favorite stock,

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:21.360
and take a look at
its dividend yield.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.850
You can find it on
yahoofinance.com as well as

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:25.320
other web sites.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.880
And then you make a guess as
to what the appropriate growth

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.210
rate is, and try to
figure out whether it

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.760
fits this equation, OK?

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.040
You can observe dividends.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.740
You can observe today's price.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.080
And you have to make an
assumption about what

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.430
you think the growth rate is.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.740
And when you plug that
in, that will give you

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.080
an estimate of what
the cost of capital

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.430
is for that particular company.

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.930
Yeah.

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:55.470
AUDIENCE: So like this exercise
without the [INAUDIBLE],,

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:59.560
with just the perpetuity
formula, D over r, incurs--

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.500
I mean, every stock
that I look at

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:07.290
seems to be more than the
dividends divided by--

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.490
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:09.720
Exactly.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.006
That's because why?

01:02:12.006 --> 01:02:14.850
Why is it, if you
just use D over P,

01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:17.490
every single stock looks
like it's overvalued.

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:18.446
What are you missing?

01:02:18.446 --> 01:02:18.832
AUDIENCE: g.

01:02:18.832 --> 01:02:19.873
ANDREW LO: Yeah, exactly.

01:02:19.873 --> 01:02:20.970
Right, you're missing g.

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:25.580
AUDIENCE: But then g turns out
to be higher than r, right?

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.040
ANDREW LO: Well, no, no, no.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.810
How did you get r?

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.250
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.850
We don't know r

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:29.975
ANDREW LO: We don't know r.

01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:32.060
That's what we're trying
to figure out, right?

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.961
So you just said you're
looking at D over P,

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.710
and you're trying to
figure out implicitly

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:40.740
what that implies for the
growth rate of stocks.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:44.179
Take a look at this expression
in light of future growth

01:02:44.179 --> 01:02:46.470
opportunities and you'll see
that dividend yield is not

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.400
the only story.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.190
You've got to use
other expressions.

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.861
Yeah.

01:02:50.861 --> 01:02:53.266
AUDIENCE: So looking at
that [INAUDIBLE] about it

01:02:53.266 --> 01:02:57.120
on an annualized basis or
between dividend payment?

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.790
ANDREW LO: Well it should
be on an annualized-- well,

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:03.042
it should be on whatever
cycle the dividends get paid.

01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:04.500
So if dividends
get paid quarterly,

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.210
then it's a quarterly
growth rate.

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.940
If it's an annual payment, then
it's an annual growth rate.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.040
So the benefit of
this expression

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.870
is that there is no timing
that's been assumed.

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:17.040
It's just whatever
the periods are.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.976
So if it's quarterly dividends,
use quarterly growth rate.

01:03:21.976 --> 01:03:22.600
Yeah, question.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.001
AUDIENCE: We can't just
go out and use this model

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.925
on just about any
company, right?

01:03:26.925 --> 01:03:28.820
Doesn't the company
have to, I guess,

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.110
pay dividends and use
dividends as, perhaps,

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:34.455
a way to represent the
[INAUDIBLE] of the company?

01:03:34.455 --> 01:03:35.330
ANDREW LO: Well, yes.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:37.820
So if it doesn't have
dividends, then this formula

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.920
is not going to be all
that interesting, right?

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.150
D's going to be 0.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.400
But remember, this
is not the current D.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.660
This is the steady state
D. And if companies

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.820
are in the early part
of their growth phase,

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.153
it's going to be hard to
estimate what that steady state

01:03:52.153 --> 01:03:52.679
D is.

01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:54.470
So there'll be other
expressions that we're

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:56.420
going to derive
in a few minutes,

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.420
where we use accounting
identities to relate dividends

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.180
to earnings or to cash flows.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.730
It used to be the case that
instead of using dividends,

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:06.380
you would use
earnings, because even

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.840
though companies that
don't pay out dividends,

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.940
they still have earnings.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.840
Well, that is until the
internet came about, right?

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.260
Then you had companies that
actually had no earnings.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:20.320
So how do you valuate a
company that has no dividends

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.750
and has no earnings, and
has negative cash flows?

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:25.390
In fact, if you use those
models, the more negative

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:27.610
the cash flow, the
higher the value.

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:30.280
So something weird is going on.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.260
It has to do with
the fact that these

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.230
are meant to be steady
state formulas, and not

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.900
formulas for individual
time periods.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.820
If there are individual
time periods where

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.460
you have zero cash flows or
negative cash flows because

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.400
of growth, you'll have to make
adjustments in the formulas,

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.495
and I'll show you how to
do that in a few minutes.

01:04:47.495 --> 01:04:47.994
Yeah.

01:04:47.994 --> 01:04:49.785
AUDIENCE: Do you have
to change the formula

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:53.980
if, let's say, the board decides
to change dividend [INAUDIBLE]??

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.140
ANDREW LO: Well,
again, this formula

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.390
is really meant to be steady
state dividends, right.

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:01.420
So if they change the dividends,
what you should not use

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.290
is this.

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:04.420
What you should go
back and use, which

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.880
is going to be a bit
more complicated,

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.720
is this, the bottom
equation, right?

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.250
So this equation
is always correct,

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:14.770
because this is
completely general.

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:17.510
Dividends at time t plus
k out into the future.

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:21.100
And so if you know the
future path of dividends,

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.610
or if you have an expectation
of what that future path is,

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.060
you can use this formula.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.240
But look how difficult this is.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.730
I mean, think about
how an equity analyst

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:33.324
has to make his living.

01:05:33.324 --> 01:05:34.990
They've got to figure
out, not only what

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:37.850
the appropriate discount rate
is, which is hard enough,

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.350
but they've going
to figure out what

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:41.890
the appropriate path
of dividends are,

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.550
not just what the dividends
will be in steady state,

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.100
because they may not
be able to do that.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.260
They may want to figure
out what the dividends are

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.080
going to be next year, the year
after, the year after that.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.200
So there's a lot
of work to be done.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:55.700
It's hard.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.220
It's hard work.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.220
But more importantly,
it's not just hard work,

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.527
it's actually very
inaccurate work.

01:06:02.527 --> 01:06:04.360
In other words, it's
really hard to estimate

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.860
this thing with any degree of
accuracy, so what do you know?

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.390
You know you're going to
be wrong most of the time.

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:15.080
Imagine a job where you go into
the job knowing that if you do

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.510
really well, you're a genius.

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:19.010
You're at the top of your class.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:22.850
You're the best that's
ever done this thing.

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:27.510
And in that case, you're going
to be right 52% of the time.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.100
52% of the time.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.680
That means you're
wrong 48% of the time.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.180
That's pretty discouraging.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.790
But that's really the
nature of this task.

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:37.020
It's really hard.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.110
You know, it's like trying
to do weather forecasting,

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:43.440
but weather forecasting
over the next 30 years,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.140
and then taking the sum total
of all of those decisions,

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.300
putting it into a portfolio,
and then investing

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.100
your life savings in that.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.850
That's kind of tough, right?

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:54.670
But it's also exciting.

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:57.470
Yeah, question?

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:59.010
OK, oh yes.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:05.494
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
If dividend

01:07:05.494 --> 01:07:07.478
is going to change
in the future,

01:07:07.478 --> 01:07:11.942
wouldn't this formula be
likened to the annuity equation?

01:07:11.942 --> 01:07:15.117
So that point in time when
it changes, for which--

01:07:15.117 --> 01:07:15.950
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:18.810
ANDREW LO: You would use
the annuity discount formula

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:20.050
in pieces.

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:23.790
So for example, if the cash
flows for the first 10 years

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.370
look like one thing, and
then the next 20 years

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:27.764
look like another
thing, and then

01:07:27.764 --> 01:07:30.180
the next 30 years look like
something else, what you could

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:35.169
do is apply the annuity discount
formula to the first 10 years,

01:07:35.169 --> 01:07:36.960
and then apply the
annuity discount formula

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.480
with a different discount
rate and a different cash flow

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.330
to the next 20, and then
discount that back and then

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:44.290
discount that back
10 more years,

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:48.030
and then do that to the next
30, and then discount it back

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.020
to the very beginning.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.550
So exactly.

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:54.510
That's the way to do it,
which is effectively doing it

01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:58.470
like this, but it's hard.

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:03.750
I mean, it's hard enough to
estimate cash flows next year.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.060
And I can tell you
there are a lot of firms

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.695
that have forecasted this
year's cash flows last year are

01:08:09.695 --> 01:08:11.070
scratching their
heads, wondering

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:13.050
how they can be so far off.

01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:17.580
Now imagine doing
it 30 years hence.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.430
I mean, it's an impossible task.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.374
But at the end of the
day, it has to be done.

01:08:23.374 --> 01:08:26.040
In other words, whether you want
to make those forecasts or not,

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.327
people are going to
trade your stock.

01:08:28.327 --> 01:08:30.160
And so if you're not
making those forecasts,

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.160
well, somebody else is
going to, because they've

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.569
got to trade the stock.

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:35.520
So what we want to
do is to figure out

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.510
a slightly better mousetrap
of understanding what

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:41.729
those forecasts are telling us.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:46.760
And if we can literally
get 52% correct rates,

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.609
we're going to be rich beyond
our wildest expectations.

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:51.481
That's really hard to do.

01:08:51.481 --> 01:08:53.689
And it's just the nature of
this particular endeavor.

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:57.620
It's very difficult to estimate
cash flows, discount rates,

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:02.984
and risk conditions so
far out into the future.

01:09:02.984 --> 01:09:04.427
Question, yes.

01:09:04.427 --> 01:09:06.806
AUDIENCE: You said we could
use this formula to calculate

01:09:06.806 --> 01:09:09.770
the firm's cost of capital.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.859
I'm wondering why
would we do that?

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:13.760
Why do I care about
the firm's cost?

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.729
I think it's much more
interesting to calculate

01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:18.651
the growth rate [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:18.651 --> 01:09:21.109
ANDREW LO: Well, in order to
calculate the cost of capital,

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:22.468
you need the growth rate.

01:09:22.468 --> 01:09:27.630
AUDIENCE: OK but,
I mean, I think

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.799
it's easier to get
the cost of capital

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:32.250
and guess the growth rate.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:35.387
I just don't understand why I
would be interested in getting

01:09:35.387 --> 01:09:36.696
to know this firm's cost--

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.279
ANDREW LO: In the
cost of capital, OK.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:42.359
Well, you would have to wait
about another seven lectures

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:45.132
for that, because there
is a reason why you care

01:09:45.132 --> 01:09:46.590
about the cost of
capital, and that

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:50.850
is that if you're trying to
decide how to spend your firm's

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:55.140
money, if you're a CFO
and you're allocating cash

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.450
across different
activities, you need

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:00.000
to know what your
firm's cost of capital

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.940
is so that you get a sense
of what the opportunity cost

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.980
versus taking that
money and investing it

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.960
in other opportunities
outside the firm.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.290
So in order to make decisions,
you need that number.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.650
AUDIENCE: If I'm in [INAUDIBLE],,
as an investor outside,

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:16.380
like, looking at the
stock market, [INAUDIBLE]??

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.922
ANDREW LO: Well,
you do, in the sense

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.671
that you want to know
whether you're going

01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:20.770
to get your money's worth.

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:23.910
I mean, if you're investing
in one company versus another,

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.530
in order to make
that decision, you

01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:28.130
need to know what the
rate of return is, right?

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.270
So it's actually
quite important.

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:32.540
It's very important
for decision-making

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.322
what that number is.

01:10:34.322 --> 01:10:35.530
AUDIENCE: Right after return.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:37.350
It's not cost of capital.

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.432
If I look it that way.

01:10:39.432 --> 01:10:41.390
ANDREW LO: So let's call
it the rate of return.

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.520
That's right, yeah.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.560
Well, and by the way,
the reason that I always

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.140
use four or five names
for the same quantity

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.777
is to sensitize you to
the fact that people

01:10:50.777 --> 01:10:52.860
look at these numbers from
different perspectives.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.800
So when I use the
term cost of capital,

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.380
I'm thinking about it as
a corporate manager who

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.050
has internal funds that
are going to be deployed

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:02.490
in different activities.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:09.060
And the cost of that capital
as a CFO is given by r.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.790
Now as an investor
external to the company,

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:13.960
I'm thinking about how
to invest my money.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.920
I want to know what
my rate of return is.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.060
And as a regulator that
wants to understand

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.670
what the appropriate
capital charge is

01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:26.460
for different kinds of
activities that are going

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.980
to be appropriate for
borrowing and lending,

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.730
I also need to know what the
appropriate risk adjustments

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.930
are to that particular number.

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:36.650
Yeah.

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:40.350
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering how frequently

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:43.760
the companies actually
change their dividend policy.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.530
Is it every year,
every few years?

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:48.290
And also are there exceptions?

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:51.290
Like is there a
reason sometimes where

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:54.190
a company who is, like,
growing to issue dividends,

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:57.320
or for a company that's got
a lot of cash to not do so?

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.400
ANDREW LO: So that's
a great question.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.030
The question is how companies
set their dividend policy.

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.550
The short answer
is that companies

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:09.980
don't like to pay dividends
unless they know for a fact

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:14.760
that they can maintain the level
for a good long period of time.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.460
And the reason is simple.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.840
When a company cuts dividends,
that's considered bad news.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.570
No matter how you slice
it, when a company decides

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:27.560
to reduce its dividends, the
typical response is uh oh, it's

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.250
cash-strapped, or it's in
trouble, there's a problem.

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:34.280
So once you know that, then
as a corporate financial--

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.900
chief financial officer--

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.520
you will not
recommend to the board

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.330
to cut dividends unless there's
a really significant issue

01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:42.200
with the firm.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.690
And therefore, as
a result, you're

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:47.720
not going to either
pay or raise dividends

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.030
unless you think you
can support that level

01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:52.550
for a good long time.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.560
So because of that
reason, you're right,

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.560
dividends don't get
changed very often.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.100
And actually, it's quite
costly in some senses

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.044
to change that dividend
policy, not just

01:13:03.044 --> 01:13:05.210
from the corporate perspective,
but from shareholder

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:05.780
perception.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.113
AUDIENCE: What about exceptions?

01:13:07.113 --> 01:13:10.080
Like why would a
company currently

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.200
do something that
is different from--

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.280
ANDREW LO: There are
exceptions because

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.770
of certain circumstances that
are unique to the company.

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.800
For example, a company
could be in a cash crunch,

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.560
like, right now, because of
some kind of capital charge

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.660
due to a certain underperforming
securities, in which case

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.190
they may declare a temporary
suspension of dividends.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.440
The other side of the
equation is that a company

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.920
may have gotten a big windfall.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.156
They just decided
to sell a division,

01:13:38.156 --> 01:13:39.780
and they've got a
large amount of cash.

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.220
They don't know what to
do with all the cash,

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.140
so what they'll do is
that they'll pay out

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.240
an extraordinary dividend.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.700
Extra ordinary
dividend, which means

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.790
that it's a one-time thing,
and then from that point on,

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:53.458
they'll go back to a
regular dividend policy.

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:53.958
Yeah.

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:55.902
AUDIENCE: What
does a [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:09.172
How you want to invest
in billions of dollars.

01:14:09.172 --> 01:14:12.420
Do you borrow money to invest
versus [INAUDIBLE] dividend

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.009
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:14:13.009 --> 01:14:15.300
ANDREW LO: Well, it depends
on how much money you have.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:18.602
It depends upon what your
shareholders want to have done.

01:14:18.602 --> 01:14:20.060
I mean, that's
certainly a decision

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.726
that a corporate
financial manager would

01:14:21.726 --> 01:14:24.050
have to make in concert
with the shareholders,

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:25.850
as well as the CEO.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.992
And that's a strategic decision.

01:14:27.992 --> 01:14:29.450
But in order to
make that decision,

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:31.574
you've got to have a few
things at your fingertips.

01:14:31.574 --> 01:14:34.052
You've got to have the
opportunity cost of capital.

01:14:34.052 --> 01:14:36.260
You've got to figure out
what your borrowing cost is.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.400
And in order to figure
out your borrowing

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.780
cost, what do you need
to know about your debt?

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:43.555 --> 01:14:44.430
ANDREW LO: How risky.

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:47.292
And how do we measure
risk with corporate debt?

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:48.750
We just talked
about it last class.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.534
Hint, hint.

01:14:49.534 --> 01:14:50.320
AUDIENCE: You got to rate it.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.986
ANDREW LO: Yeah, you
need a rate, right.

01:14:51.986 --> 01:14:54.540
So you have to figure
out whether or not

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:57.450
the cost of funds from
internally-generated sources

01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:59.670
is cheaper or more
expensive than going

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:01.470
to the external capital markets.

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:05.400
Right now, I would say that
it's extremely expensive

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.280
to go out into capital markets,
if you could do it at all.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.530
If you're going to
raise money, you're

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.270
going to be paying
up through the nose.

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:16.170
General Electric credit
default swap today

01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:19.440
was priced at 700 basis points.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.420
This is AAA-rated security,
at 700 basis points credit.

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.020
It's crazy!

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.077
But people don't want
to lend right now.

01:15:27.077 --> 01:15:29.160
So if you want to borrow
in capital markets today,

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.010
good luck.

ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well,
good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is 14.04, and the
title is Economic Science.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%
You'll see why momentarily.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of who we are,
I'm Professor Townsend.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll be teaching
the main lectures.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:90%
So what is this course about?

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
This is about not just theory
and certainly not just data.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about the combination
of theory and data

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
economics as a science.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So in that respect,
it may be a little bit

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
different from classes
that you're used to.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not to memorize
theoretical material

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and know which way
to shift a curve.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not just reading empirical
literature and discussing it.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the more challenging
and more fun job

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
of bringing those
two things together.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Background quickly, just in
case you're worried about it--

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
we do assume you've had
multivariate calculus as well

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
as basic economic
theory in 14.01.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
There will be some use of
linear algebra, statistics,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and some language having to do
with algorithms and computing.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But you're not to worry about
that because if you are not

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the
level that we need,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a very deep level.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the readings,
all the class readings

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and the relevant
textbook chapters,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
there's not one single
textbook for the class.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:90%
There's four or so.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But we carefully selected
the relevant sections

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
of those textbooks, and
you don't need to scramble

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to find them because they're
on the class website.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So each topic in each lecture
has a set of readings.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
One, two, or three will
be designated as a star.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they're
really the basis of the lecture

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
or provide key complementary
reading material.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You are responsible for
those in terms of exams,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and you'll need them
for problem sets.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
There are other things
on the reading list,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
recommended readings that I hope
you will engage in and enjoy.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, those
could be subjects

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.625 align:middle line:90%
for discussion in Piazza.

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to focus on
theory and applications.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be using
empirical and theoretical

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:90%
papers.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, we
are combining them.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:84%
As I was already
alluding to, this

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:90%
is not an easy thing to do.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:90%
One has to learn how to do this.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you cannot
do it on your own,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
so I strongly encourage you to
participate in the lectures,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and recitations,
and interactions.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, please
engage when you're online

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and avoid texting, tweeting,
emailing, blogging,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera, shopping.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
You may think that
you can multitask,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but typically quality of
learning would suffer.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So now we get into
the more fun part,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
which is what are we going
to be studying in this class.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go over the
spirit of it, economic science,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the
economies we're

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be
studying, and then go

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
through the syllabus in
a kind of a broad way,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:84%
not trying to read
everything that's there.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to draw
on these authors--

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Frisch for thinking about
economics as experiments,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Matzkin for a review of some of
the fundamentals of vocabulary

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
of econometrics, Angrist
for randomized and natural

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
experiments, Varian for big
data and the need of theory

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
for causal influence,
and Lucas on what

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
are models, what are
artificial economies, and what

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is the role of
models versus data,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and how does
computation help us.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's just an
outline of what's coming.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Frisch opened his
lecture in 1926

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
with an article entitled "On
a Problem in Pure Economics."

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And to quote him, he said,
"Intermediate between

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, statistics, and
economics, Econometrics"--

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
he kind of invented the term--
"has as its aim to subject

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
abstract laws of theoretical
political economy or pure

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
economics to experimental
or numerical validation,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and thus to turn pure
economics, as far as possible,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
into a science in the
strictest sense of the word."

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Or to put this more
in layman's terms,

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
he's saying economics is
not just about theory,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:90%
it's about validating theory.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So just like the linear
accelerator at Stanford

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
bombards particles to see
whether the outcomes are

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
consistent with the
predictions, that's

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
our framework for thinking
about actual economies,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
by running experiments
on them to validate them

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:90%
and to do policy.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a graph from
Burns and Mitchell,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:90%
a book, On Business Cycles.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
closely, you'll see

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:90%
these dates are pretty early.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:90%
They run from 1875 to 1900.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And as a business
cycle goes, it's

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about depressed activity
versus upswings and so on.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the ups and downs.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You might be interested
to know that the National

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Bureau of Economic Research,
which is now housed here

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:84%
in Cambridge, actually
began in Columbia, where

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Burns and Mitchell
were working on this.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So Koopmans reacted to
Burns and Mitchell's book,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
which was quite
famous and obviously

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
had an enormous
influence, arguing about

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.955 align:middle line:84%
whether measurement
is enough, which

00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:90%
he says, no, we need theory.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And we need the whole
enterprise to be

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
about understanding
and utilizing

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:90%
the framework for policy.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's a bunch
of quotes here

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:84%
from Koopmans in this famous
article, Measurement Without

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Theory.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
He says, "The author's
scientific strategy

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
has measurement and observation
preceding, and largely

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
independent of, any attempts to
really explain" the variables.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But he, Koopmans, believes
there should or could

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
be more of a purpose--

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that more is meant, namely,
a genuine explanation

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
of economic fluctuations,
with the idea that there

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
are a few extra economic
phenomena that are accepted

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:90%
as data without inquiry.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But most of it has to do with
phenomenon being generated

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:84%
by assumed behavior
of individuals

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and the interaction of
the behavior in markets.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:90%
And then he goes on--

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is tongue
in cheek or just soft selling--

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
"I am not sure whether a
still further objective

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
is included, which extrapolates
the idea of explanation

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
to prediction, within "the
narrowest attainable limits,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the effect of economic
policy on the movement

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:90%
of economic variables.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
He actually says, I feel
that prediction is actually

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
the most important
objective of the analysis

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:90%
of economic fluctuations."

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's not
just measurement,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
it's measurement with
theory for understanding,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and with that baseline
conducting policy assessments.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Business cycles are still with
us, although this discussion

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:90%
may seem a bit dated.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So I give you a
contemporary example,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
which is measuring,
understanding,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and predicting the economic
impact of COVID-19.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.387 align:middle line:84%
And we will return to this theme
periodically throughout some

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:41.054 align:middle line:90%
of the lectures.

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Matzkin is about
econometrics, and she

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.465 align:middle line:84%
delineates the ingredients
here quite well.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
We have an economic
model describing

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the agents who are involved,
their objective functions,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
their information, the
way they're interacting.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The econometrician tries to fit
the economic model to the data

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and has to make the
following distinctions--

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:84%
first of all, which variables
in the model are observable

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and which are unobservable?

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Also, which variables
are determined

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
outside the model versus
those that are determined

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:90%
inside the model--

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:90%
exogenous versus endogenous?

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Variables determined
within the model

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
are usually determined
by the choices of agents,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
by their interaction
with each other.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The model also contains a list
of functions and distributions.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of these functions
are primitive, exogenously

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:90%
determined.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They may be observed
or unobserved.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And others are determined
within the model itself.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:84%
They're not deep concepts,
but important to remember--

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
observed versus unobserved,
exogenous versus endogenous,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
parameters versus functions
versus distributions.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Josh Angrist on running
experiments, as in randomized

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
controlled trial versus
quasi-natural experiments.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So he's referring here to a
genuine randomized controlled

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
trial engaged by
Fehr and Goette,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
where they selected some
bicycle messengers to receive

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
temporarily higher wages,
and had a control group that

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:90%
did not receive the increase.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you compare
across the two groups.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
The study showed that
increase in wages

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:90%
did make people work harder.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And because it was
temporary, it didn't really

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:90%
change lifetime wealth.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So one is able to out the
impact of income changes

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to wealth changes,
or in the jargon you'll learn,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
we can identify the
intertemporal substitution

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:90%
of elasticity and its magnitude.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But Josh goes on to say
experiments are time-consuming.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:90%
They're expensive.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
They're not always
practical but.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
This frame that we
use of experiments

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
is still very
helpful, especially

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
because human institutions
or the forces of nature

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
step into the breach and
provide natural or quasi-natural

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So an influential
paper by David Card

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:90%
looked at the Mariel boatlift.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Fidel Castro temporarily
allowed free exodus of Cubans

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
to the US, and
they came to Miami.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a 7% increase over
a period of three months,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and that can be used to study
the impact of immigration.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Another example
is the destruction

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
of public housing in
Chicago, where they literally

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
were giving residents
alternative places to live,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and then dynamiting the
building and blowing it up.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's documented
that they chose

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
in effectively a random way
which building to blow up.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you can compare
what's happening

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in public housing
that remains versus

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
what's happening to
the residents who

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
have been moved elsewhere.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And to a degree,
the financial crisis

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
also provides something of a
series of natural experiments

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:90%
in banking.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure how
many of you have

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:90%
heard this term, "big data."

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's quite widely used and
attracts a lot of attention.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And Varian is
talking about that.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Machine learning
specialists are primarily

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
concerned with developing
high-performance computer

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
systems that provide predictions
in the presence of challenging

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:90%
computational constraints.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Data science is a somewhat newer
term, concerned with prediction

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and summarization, but also
manipulation, visualization,

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and other tasks.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:90%
However, the shoe drops--

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
most important area
for collaboration

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:90%
involves casual inference.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Machine learning has
its part to play.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:90%
It deals with pure prediction.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's a difference
between correlation

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:90%
among variables and causation.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And he gives this
example, which nowadays

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is a bit more nuanced than
it was when he wrote it,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:90%
a classic example--

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
there are often more police
in precincts with high crime,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
but that does not mean that
increasing number of police

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.555 align:middle line:84%
in a precinct would
increase the crime.

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
he's trying to say

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is which way does
the causality go--

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
from police to crime or
from crime to police?

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And just seeing a correlation
between police and crime

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in the data does
not tell you what

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
the outcome would
be of increasing

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:90%
the number of police.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:90%
So Rubin who's an advocate of--

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
who's thought of as in
the behavioral group--

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
is actually in
agreement that we need

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to think about the causal
impact of treatment

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to compare outcomes
of an intervention

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
to what would have happened
without the intervention.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it alone with data.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.635 align:middle line:90%
You need some model to do that.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Lucas on artificial economies--

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the functions of
theoretical economics

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
is to provide articulated,
artificial economic systems

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:84%
that serve as laboratories
in which policies that

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
are prohibitively expensive
to do in actual economies

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
can be tested through the
model at much lower cost.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But he goes on to say
that to do this well,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:84%
it's really important
to distinguish

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
the artificial model economy
as sharply as possible

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:90%
from actual economies.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is a bit subtle.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Insofar as there is confusion
between the statements

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
of opinion as to
the way we believe

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
actual economies would react
to particular policies,

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and confused with statements
of verifiable fact

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
as to how the model
would react, then

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
we're not using the
theory effectively.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people
will make statements

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
about what they
believe will happen

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
as a consequence
of a policy change.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And the danger is
we may not know,

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and they may not be clear,
if their prediction of what

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
would happen is based on data or
based on the logic of a model.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And then going on,
if we have the model,

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
we can see the
predicted outcome based

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
on the logic of the model.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go to the
data and see which statements

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:90%
of opinion are accurate or not.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's Lucas's view of
the science of economics.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And in other words, instead of
being pushed toward what would

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:90%
seem to be an attractive goal--

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to make models more
and more complicated

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:90%
so that they're more realistic--

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Bob Lucas is actually
pushing the opposite point

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of view, which is to earmark
them as artificial, potentially

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
relatively simple, so
that we can understand

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the logic of what
the models predict.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I said, keep
them relatively simple.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, economists
are getting better and better

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
at writing down and
analyzing models.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the innovations that
has happened over the years

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is not just the mathematics,
for which Bob Lucas is well

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
known along with his
economics, but also the ability

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to compute solutions,
which he feels

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
is neglected in the
history of economic science

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
but which is, in fact, an
important consideration.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So you guys are
all MIT students.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I probably don't have to say
this, but we in this class

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
are also not going to shy
away from computational issues

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:90%
when they arise.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And I will take you through
some of the algorithms

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and share those with you.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to turn to the
description of five economies.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're also partly
representative of the kind

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of economies we're going to
be studying in the class.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll get back
to economic science,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about how
we're going to analyze them.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So let me focus on
economies for now.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So the first economy, the
medieval village economy,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:84%
consists of about
300 households.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They can grow wheat with plows,
oxen, and of course, land.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But the land is
not consolidated.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
The land is spread out
over the various fields

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
into long narrow strips,
quite fragmented--

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
on average, something like 30
to 60 strips for each household.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Second economy is a
Thai village economy.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Households are growing
rice and they're

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
growing it in paddies,
not in scattered land.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
If the monsoons are
overly abundant,

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:84%
households with low-lying
land will experience flooding

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and households with land on the
rise actually do quite well.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But the opposite is true
in a medium to dry year.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
The low-lying land does well
and the land on the rise

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:90%
is subject to a drought.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
variation, a lot of risk.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
All households in
the Thai village

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
are obliged to transfer a
certain amount of their crop

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to the local temple.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Buddhist monks run the temple.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the households with
low crops in a given year

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:84%
can request an allotment
from the temple stocks.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even necessarily
have to repay right away.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a function in subsequent
years of whether they

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:90%
get their yields back up.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise,
remarkably, there's

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.890 align:middle line:84%
no borrowing and lending in this
village, just this institution.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The third economy is drawn
on a description of Oaxaca

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a set of
villages, not just one.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
The villages are
separated from each other

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.360 align:middle line:90%
by nontrivial distances.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's flat
land on a plain.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there were
rivers, and valleys,

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and other
topographical features.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Each village specializes in
production of a distinct good--

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:84%
could be baskets, or pottery,
or textiles, machetes.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
They produce a lot of that
good and relatively little

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
of the other ones,
but each village

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
values the commodities
which it does not produce.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then trade occurs in a
series of regional markets.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
The fourth economy is similar,
except that when traders

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
meet in these geographically
separated markets,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:84%
they're observe to give
up produced goods, not

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
for other goods but
for paper notes, which

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
are IOUs promising to
pay goods in the future

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:90%
or pay money in the future.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So these notes are observed,
and used in exchange,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and circulate around
the regional markets.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The fifth economy is from
Malinowski's book Argonauts

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:90%
of the Pacific.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:90%
It's another set of islands--

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
well, villages, but
they're on islands.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And they form a circle.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So typically, residents
of each island

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
embark in canoes on
trading expeditions,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:84%
traveling either in a clockwise
or counterclockwise direction

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:90%
to the nearest island neighbor.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:84%
If they're traveling in a
clockwise direction, when they

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
reach the beach of the
island of destination,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
they give up their cargo to
those neighboring Islanders

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
in a series of
elaborate ceremonies.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
The goods go one way and
distinctive white-shell

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:90%
armbands come back.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
If they were traveling in the
other, opposite direction,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
counterclockwise, and they
reach the nearest island,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:84%
they unload the
cargo and receive

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:90%
distinctive red-shell necklaces.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
These armbands and
necklaces are entirely

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
used for these
ceremonies, to prohibited

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:90%
to be used for other things.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's very,
very rare for cargo

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to arrive without the
shells and armbands going

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:90%
in the other direction.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, you
may be a little worried

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to study
villages and anthropological

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
works, but let me
draw an analogy that

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:84%
is revealing about
the way economists

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:90%
think about modeling economies.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Lucas-- the same Bob
Lucas I mentioned before--

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
talks about trees bearing fruit,
which is an agrarian metaphor,

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't really
mean a village.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And Lucas doesn't like
villages very much, actually.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
He actually meant
financial markets.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So a security is an
asset like a tree that

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:90%
bears dividends like fruit.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
language that allows

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
us to go back and forth
from something concrete,

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:84%
like a tree in a
village, to something

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:84%
a little more abstract,
like financial securities.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
One of those economies, the
fourth one, mentioned IOUs.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
They were bills of
exchange historically,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and now they're called repos.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So these treasuries
used as collateral

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to back loan, called
the repo contract.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And that repo will circulate
where the original borrower

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:84%
becomes a lender,
and the repo contract

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
goes down the financial
chain, and then comes back.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And that strange Malinowski
economy I mentioned to you

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
is actually a close
analogy to Bitcoin.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Because Bitcoin tried to keep
track of histories of things

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:90%
to condition outcomes.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And they realized they need
to "color" the coins in order

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to distinguish more history.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Nowadays they do it differently.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
period where Bitcoin

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:90%
was featuring colored coins.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's very similar--
the economics of that is very

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:90%
similar--

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:90%
to these seashells in Indonesia.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone all the way
from villages, if not

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
primitive economies, to not only
modern-day financial markets

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
but also to Bitcoin.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, in the class, going
to maintain and come back

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
periodically to a study
of Bitcoin of blockchains

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and distributed ledgers,
thinking about it

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:90%
as innovation in the technology.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
So what is a distributed ledger?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:84%
A distributed ledger
technology refers

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to the processes and related
technologies that enable nodes

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
in a network or some arrangement
to securely propose, validate,

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and record state changes to
a synchronized ledger that

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:84%
is distributed across
the network nodes--

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:90%
a bit long-winded.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll come back to it.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it important?

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
This from Harvard Business
School colleagues,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Iansiti and Lakhani,
a quote from them.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:84%
"Contracts, transactions,
and the records of them

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:84%
are among the most
defining structures

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:84%
in economic, legal,
and political systems.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Yet these critical tools
and the bureaucracy

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:84%
formed to manage them have
not kept up with the economy's

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:90%
digital transformation.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
They're like a rush-hour
gridlock trapping a Formula 1

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:90%
race car.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
With blockchain, we can imagine
a world in which contracts

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
are embedded in digital code,
stored in transparent shared

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
databases, where they are
protected from deletion,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:90%
tampering, and revision.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
entire landscape

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
can change with these
new technologies.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Although the Harvard
Business School colleagues

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
are trying to be neutral,
their enthusiasm is evident,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
controversy about Bitcoin

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and about blockchain.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So Satoshi Nakamoto-- we don't
know if he's real or not--

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:90%
this is a pen name, presumably--

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.730 align:middle line:90%
invented Bitcoin.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, he
said, "What is needed

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is an electronic payment system
based on cryptographic proof

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
instead of trust, allowing
two willing parties

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to transact directly
with each other

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
without a need for a
trusted third party."

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, this message was
not lost on central banks,

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
because Satoshi is
basically saying

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
we don't need fiat money,
we just need Bitcoin,

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
or Bitcoin can
replace Fiat money.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see the Banker
International Settlement

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
with statements like,
"Decentralized technology

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
associated with
cryptocurrencies, however

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated, is
a poor substitute

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
for the solid institutional
backing of money."

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Or Denison, Lee and
Martin, two of whom

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
are co-authors of mine
at the New York Fed,

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:90%
"People do trust third parties.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.916 align:middle line:84%
They trust central banks to
provide currency and reserves.

00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And they trust derivative
payment systems that are run

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
by named and trusted
institutions--

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
he has in mind
commercial banks--

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
that maintain the ledgers
and the operating system.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Trustless, expensive,
decentralized systems

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:90%
are not needed."

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Many of these distributed
ledger platforms

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
promoted by the industry use
the word "disintermediation."

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you view it
kindly, what they mean

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:84%
is third parties are
extracting monopoly rents.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a
regulator and you

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
see someone trying
to disintermediate

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the financial
system, you're going

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
to be a little bit
worried about that.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very interesting,
a very controversial area.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And every, I don't know,
five or six lectures

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:84%
or so, we'll come back
to the theory and data

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that we've been dealing
with, and ask questions

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:84%
about Bitcoin, and
see what we can learn

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of economics.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So I listed previously five
economies and the comment

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that they're
metaphors, including

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
for the study of
modern economies,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
including all the
way through Bitcoin

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and things that are
happening today.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Here's a partial list.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to study the
medieval village economy.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We're going to study village
India, northern Thai villages.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go from
villages to local economies

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:84%
as in Oaxaca, in
this case Thailand,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
to regional economies to
the whole national economy.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're as much talking
about nation-states

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
as we are about
individual villages.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we'll go
to the United States

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and talk about local, state,
and the US national economy.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:84%
We will be looking at US
financial markets, as well.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Here and there we'll
talk about China,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
which you might say started as a
village or a bunch of villages,

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and has become a very
important international player.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's a list of economies.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do we
mean by an economy?

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
When we model them,
there is a systematic way

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%
to do this that you will learn.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when we
write down an economy,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:84%
we mean to specify
the commodity space.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And within the
commodity space, we'll

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
talk about the preferences
of agents, their endowments,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and the technology
available to them.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So one way to remember
this is like a PET economy.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It is not the most favorable
way of thinking about it.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But PET is in preferences,
endowments, and technology.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And it is possible, when you're
learning the tools of how

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to do the analysis, to get
so lost in the notation

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that you'll forget
about the applications.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So I want to keep
coming back, even

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:84%
on the early building-block
lectures, to the idea

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that we have a common way of
constructing economies that

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.700 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to consider
dynamics, allow us to consider

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:84%
geography, and allow us to
deal with risk and uncertainty

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:90%
as in states of the world.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So now, I want to be more
specific about what we're

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:90%
going to be doing in the class.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
this in two ways.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
The first is to go
through the main headers

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%
so you'll see the
content, and the topics,

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:90%
and a bit of the methods.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to come back and kind

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:84%
of selectively look
at the smaller print

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and make some auxiliary points.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, today is Lecture 1.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
economic science.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Then starting
Thursday, we're going

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the building blocks
for constructing economies.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
As I said, preference,
endowments, and technology.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to try to
use that material right away.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be engaged
in conducting

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
some partial equilibrium
applications and experiments.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So the building blocks are
consumer choice, consumer

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:90%
behavior, and production.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the traditional
way to teach micro,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:84%
but it tends to consume
much more of the course

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:90%
than we will.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to get the basics
down and build on the basics,

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:90%
as I have been saying.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:84%
But here, you may
lose track of the fact

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing these building
blocks which we're subsequently

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
going to use when we're
constructing economies.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The next section,
Lectures 5 and 6,

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
talk about decision-making under
uncertainty, focusing on risk

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and on linear programs
and dynamic programs.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to that momentarily.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Then lecture 7
through 9, we finally

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:90%
get to entire economies.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll develop a
concept of welfare

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:90%
called Pareto optimality.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And we'll right away move toward
applications, risk sharing

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and dynamics in
village economies,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:84%
including social networks,
supply chains, impact

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of health shocks.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And here right away we'll
get into the impact of COVID

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
as a function of
whether or not there

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:90%
are these insurance networks.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And we'll merge this with
supply chains and production

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.110 align:middle line:90%
as in lecture 9.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Lecture 10 is about financial
accounts and management.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So it will talk about income
statements and balance

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
sheets, and household
financial statements

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:84%
generally, and then also talk
about cash management, which

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:90%
brings us to Bitcoin.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I promise Bitcoin in
distributed ledgers.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:84%
"Ledgers" means "accounts,"
so this is the natural way

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to start talking about Bitcoin,
and ledgers, and management.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Lectures 11 through 12 start
to bring in obstacles to trade,

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
in particular private
information, where

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.420 align:middle line:84%
we need to think about
contracts and mechanism design.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do this
in theory and we'll

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.820 align:middle line:90%
add an application right away.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll actually do
several applications.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.227 align:middle line:90%
Lectures 13 through 15--

00:31:45.227 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
these three lectures
are going to deal

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.050 align:middle line:84%
with the definition of a
competitive equilibrium,

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
or Walrasian equilibrium, in
the general equilibrium setting.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to use
it for prediction, namely

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:01.870 align:middle line:84%
what is the impact
of trade or tariffs?

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:84%
What is the impact of
not only real, but also

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.090 align:middle line:84%
financial liberalization
and repression?

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:84%
We'll do that in Thailand
and we'll do it in the US.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Then lectures 16 and 17
deal with whether or not

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:84%
competitive equilibria
are Pareto optimal,

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and with issues of existence of
competitive equilibria and Nash

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
These two lectures, 18 and
19, are a juxtaposition

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of the micro and
the macro, the macro

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
being dealing with aggregates
from the top imposing

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the structure,
basically from above,

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:45.720 align:middle line:84%
versus juxtaposed with
the micro and the data,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.230 align:middle line:84%
where we can talk about
whether anything can be really

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:84%
identified, talk about
identifying, identification,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
and falsification.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And the last two lectures
focus on the failure

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.690 align:middle line:84%
of the two welfare
theorems, which

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:84%
have to do with whether
competitive equilibria are

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.600 align:middle line:84%
optimal and whether optimal
allocations can be supported

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:90%
as competitive equilibria.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Those two theorems
can fail, but there

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:84%
are interesting
consequences of that.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Namely in those economies,
we have value intrinsically

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:90%
worthless but valued money.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about the value
of Bitcoin, for example,

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and other cryptocurrencies.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
monetary policy.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, we can
focus on bubbles,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and not whether bubbles are bad
necessarily, but ironically,

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:90%
whether they're big enough.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
broad headers I'm

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:84%
quite excited about the
class, and teaching the class,

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:90%
and interacting with you.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, going
through that, you

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.110 align:middle line:84%
can see how much
material we will cover

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and the importance
of the material.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But let me come back a
minute, without going

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
into the details
of everything here,

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to let you in on a
secret of the strategy.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we get, for example,
right away on Thursday

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
to consumer choice, we'll be
talking about consumption sets,

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.679 align:middle line:84%
and rational preferences,
and utility functions,

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and properties of
various things,

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:90%
which is extremely important.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.639 align:middle line:84%
But we jump into
an application even

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.520 align:middle line:84%
in that lecture, which
is utility maximization

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:90%
subject to budget constraints.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do those things,
we need our first major method.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
constrained optimization

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and the use of
Lagrangian programs.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So the not-so-secret
secret is going

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to be that we're
training, hopefully,

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:84%
learning the
methods of analysis,

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:84%
as these theories
and topics come up.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Usually in every lecture
or almost every lecture,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.360 align:middle line:84%
there's something
about a method that

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
will be very powerful that
I'll want you to learn.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:84%
And we will take the
time to go over it.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Consumer behavior,
which is Lecture 3,

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
is an elaboration on
the application, which

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is what happens and
how do consumers

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:06.010 align:middle line:84%
behave when prices are moving
and their incomes are moving

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
abstract stuff you

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:84%
may have seen before about
normal goods and Giffin Goods.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just
memorizing that stuff,

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go to an
actual economy, which

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is China, where the
authors actually did

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.750 align:middle line:84%
one of our randomized
controlled trial experiments,

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and varied prices, and looked at
whether or not demand actually

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.360 align:middle line:84%
went the wrong way-- demand
went up when prices go up.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll learn
some more tools.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll make this
distinction between

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:84%
compensated and uncompensated
demands, duality, Slutsky--

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean anything
now, probably.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're building
towards statements

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of if you had data, could you
use data to accept or reject

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:90%
a model.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So the mapping from
the theory to the data,

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:84%
as Lucas would have put it, is
happening with the ingredients

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:90%
at the end of Lecture 3.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Lecture 4 is on production.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the second
building block.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And there we do production
functions, inputs and outputs,

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.640 align:middle line:90%
return to scale.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, we jump
to an application,

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:84%
which is profit maximization,
which is the analog--

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
firms maximize
profits given prices,

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.310 align:middle line:84%
consumers maximize utility
subject to prices and income.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go through that
and derive some properties.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And then up pops another
method, namely, we

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
need something called
the Envelope Theorem.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So when we get there, we
can go over what that means.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we jump back, at
the end of this lecture,

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:90%
to some fake economies.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Robinson Crusoe economy
is one of the economists'

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
all-time favorite-- an island
populated by one person,

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But that immediately leads
to international trade,

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:90%
two-country examples.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you some
work that Leontief

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.620 align:middle line:84%
did on Input/Output
matrices that is actually

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.910 align:middle line:84%
relevant for understanding
Google search algorithms

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and for studying the great
East Japan earthquake.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And on this topic
of decision-making

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:84%
under uncertainty, we will
talk about risk and measures

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
of willingness to get out of
risk if you had the option

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.900 align:middle line:90%
to buy insurance.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So we will go through
some important concepts.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But then we will
immediately apply it

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to the medieval village economy
that I've already referred you

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to, and including
land fragmentation.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And then for methods we'll be
focusing on linear programs.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And that carries over,
not just to this topic.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But we will use linear
programs frequently

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.770 align:middle line:84%
from this point on through
many of the other subsequent

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:90%
lectures.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And coupled with linear programs
are dynamic programs, where

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.850 align:middle line:90%
things are happening over time.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the application
there is going to be,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.240 align:middle line:84%
why were these medieval villages
starving to death every 12

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.140 align:middle line:84%
years, even though in principle,
they could be storing grain?

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.440 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do it much.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And the method is going to be
dynamic programming and value

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.410 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.360 align:middle line:84%
When we get to Pareto
optimality, of course,

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.860 align:middle line:90%
we'll define what it means.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
the Pareto frontier.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll have our first
genuinely spelled-out economy,

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.870 align:middle line:84%
an Edgeworth Box
Economy in the abstract.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a way
to determine the set

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of efficient
Pareto-optimal allocations

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:90%
for any given economy.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we have another
tool, separating hyperplanes.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'll define it and
show you some pictures.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we go right
away to an example, which

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
how would you know

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.700 align:middle line:84%
whether an economy is really
efficiently allocating risk

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.720 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the next
two lectures do

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that in much greater detail,
going to Village India,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.520 align:middle line:84%
which I mentioned was one of
the economies we were going

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to study, looking
at relationship

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.910 align:middle line:84%
between consumption and
income, and then go back

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to the medieval village
economy, and try to understand

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:08.270 align:middle line:84%
whether the way they
were dividing up land

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
into those narrow strips
would or would not

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:84%
be consistent with an optimal
allocation of risk bearing,

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and under what circumstances.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we throw production
in there, as well.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So now we have risk,
consumers, and production.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about risk
and return, and risk premia,

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:30.500 align:middle line:84%
whether they share idiosyncratic
household-specific shocks, what

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:84%
to do about common,
macro-aggregate shocks.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And this part of the lecture
ends with the role of gifts,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.870 align:middle line:84%
the role of social networks,
and the transmission

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:90%
of shocks in villages.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The transmission of shocks
is actually a health shock.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a COVID shock.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But it does give us
a way of thinking

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:84%
about the impact of COVID in
terms of impacting a household,

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not they have
formal or informal coverage

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.810 align:middle line:84%
to cover that bad shock, and if
they don't, how the impact can

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.940 align:middle line:84%
spread around to other
people that they've

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.470 align:middle line:90%
been interacting with.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean the
spread of the virus.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean the economic
adverse outcomes

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that propagate, not
the way the virus

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:84%
propagates, but through
economic mechanisms.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
When we get to household
financial accounts--

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned this already
about five minutes ago--

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.820 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
ledgers and management.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about household
financial accounts

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.050 align:middle line:84%
because we need them
to understand ledgers.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:84%
With the income and
the balance sheet,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about
life cycle management.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you a wealth
planner, a life-cycle wealth

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:84%
planner that we implemented
in Thai villages,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and show you an analog
wealth planner for the US.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Then we merge to
Bitcoin, for which

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand
the statement of cash flow

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship between
the flow and the stocks,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:84%
as in the balance sheet and the
cash flow, which will take us

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to thinking about
alternative economies,

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.110 align:middle line:84%
for example Thailand,
again, which

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is still using paper
currency all over the place--

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about whether
that's efficient or not--

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to Sweden, which has
virtually no currency left.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a virtually
cashless economy now.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:90%
They're worried about that.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead of fighting
Bitcoin, they're

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.800 align:middle line:84%
thinking about introducing a
central bank digital currency.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about that.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And Kenya is a poor
developing country in between,

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.280 align:middle line:84%
where they have both
Kenyan shillings, which

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:84%
is fiat money, as well as
an electronic money, M-Pesa,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:45.130 align:middle line:84%
which are claims on your
cellphone-- basically cellphone

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.507 align:middle line:90%
accounts, cellphone credits.

00:41:46.507 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
some of the issues that

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:53.320 align:middle line:84%
come up with distributed ledgers
in all those three contexts--

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Thailand, Sweden, and Kenya.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to contracts
next, which has

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:90%
to do with private information.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.970 align:middle line:84%
In terms of methods,
I'll share with you

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:84%
something called the
Revelation Principle, which

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:84%
allows us to append some extra
constraints onto things that we

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.810 align:middle line:84%
did previously and continue
to use the same methods.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Here, we'll need some
lotteries to get the commodity

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.930 align:middle line:90%
space to be tractable.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And in this lecture, we'll go
to those Harvard Business School

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.770 align:middle line:84%
professors and talk
about smart contracts--

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:30.670 align:middle line:84%
what it means, how to implement
solutions to mechanism

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.930 align:middle line:90%
design problems.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:84%
This part, again, is
now, when you understand

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:39.040 align:middle line:84%
contracts, the language of smart
contracts will make more sense.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll do both together,
and then we'll

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.270 align:middle line:84%
have applications
studying contracts

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
in practice for small and
medium enterprise in Thailand.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.890 align:middle line:84%
In this case,
again, one of these

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:54.460 align:middle line:84%
lectures where we combine
the theory and the data

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
together to make
inferences about what

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:90%
the obstacles to trade are.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So then we get to the
Walrasian Equilibrium,

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:90%
competitive equilibrium.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll define it, and
we'll immediately

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:84%
apply it to the concept
of trade across countries,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.840 align:middle line:90%
the gains from trade--

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:84%
or actually, who
loses, not just who

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.810 align:middle line:84%
wins from trade-- and some
well-known theorems about that,

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:84%
about the effect of trade
on wages and input prices.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:84%
With that theory in hand, we'll
go to two different economies.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll go to Thailand
and talk about villages

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:84%
as small open
economies, what's been

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:84%
the impact on them of increasing
trade within the economy,

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.450 align:middle line:84%
the impact on them in
terms of the opening

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:84%
up of the financial
system so that money

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is flowing more easily, which
is the flip side of tariffs.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And there are losers
to liberalization,

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:84%
just like there are
losers to trade.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So the thrust of
all of this is try

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to use the model with the
data to identify who wins

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:90%
and who loses from trade.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously, we'll be
set up to talk about the US

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the thing now
called the China Shock, which

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:09.220 align:middle line:84%
is the rise of China, the
rise of China exports,

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:84%
into Europe and into the
US, and the impact that

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:16.540 align:middle line:84%
has had on various states that
used to produce goods, which

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.590 align:middle line:84%
are now not so competitive
with Chinese imports.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of your view, you
can see the importance here.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Because what's going on
in the US and these policy

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:84%
measures that are adopted
having to do with trade,

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and which used to
be NAFTA and so on,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and now it's pulling out of
the Asia-Pacific Agreement

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and having this
contest with China.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So we want to look
at those issues,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.410 align:middle line:84%
not from a political
standpoint but

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.630 align:middle line:84%
from an economic
standpoint, to understand

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:84%
what we know about the
beneficiaries and the losers,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and ideally try
to quantify that.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
This section is
also about the data

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:90%
available to do the analysis.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have far less
data than we wish that we did.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.355 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
I have a section

00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:06.820 align:middle line:84%
which I have to
update periodically

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.020 align:middle line:84%
on what is the impact of
COVID-19 on the US economy.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, we'll
go back to what's

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the impact on income,
looking at income levels,

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and ethnicity, and so
on, but also what's

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the impact on the balance
sheet and on debt.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And we know some
things, but you will

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.440 align:middle line:84%
discover that the
integrated data is not

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:90%
available in the US.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are actually
surprising things we don't know.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, all this discussion
about inequality, how much

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:90%
wealth the top 1% own--

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that's much less
securely measured

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.700 align:middle line:90%
than you might imagine.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go into
the reasons why.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have optimality
of competitive equilibria

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:50.380 align:middle line:90%
in existence.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
We have theorems-- existence
of competitive equilibria,

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:90%
existence of Nash equilibria.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:84%
For the Nash
equilibrium, we'll go

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to a model of US
financial markets

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and try to analyze why
we see trade fails,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:84%
where those repo contracts
fail, and whether penalties

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
could or should
have been in place

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to prevent those failures.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I think I said enough about
aggregation and identification

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.930 align:middle line:84%
already when I went through
this the first time.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And we end with when the
welfare theorems fail,

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:90%
but not stopping there.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The analogy with
pollution is to fix it

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.710 align:middle line:90%
by selling rights to pollute.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about how
to handle externalities

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.480 align:middle line:90%
much more generally.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about failures
of the First Welfare theorem

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.550 align:middle line:84%
when there's dynamics and an
infinite amount of wealth.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, when
it fails, we'll

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:45.320 align:middle line:90%
see the emergence of money--

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.500 align:middle line:90%
both fiat money and Bitcoin.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.790 align:middle line:90%
One word about Bitcoin--

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:52.850 align:middle line:84%
when the former head
of the New York Fed

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:57.380 align:middle line:84%
referred to Bitcoin
as the adversary,

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:84%
he was saying
something about there's

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.750 align:middle line:84%
nothing fundamental pinning
down the value of Bitcoin.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
a central banker,

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.000 align:middle line:84%
don't throw stones when
you live in glass houses,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.250 align:middle line:84%
because there's absolutely
nothing fundamental pinning

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.530 align:middle line:84%
down the value of the
US dollar, either.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the same model will
make clear that statement,

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and hence, why it's possible
Bitcoin is volatile and danger,

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:84%
again, for fiat money,
and remedies having

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.380 align:middle line:90%
to do with monetary policy.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, the course
moves systematically,

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.150 align:middle line:90%
so try to keep up.

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:46.000 align:middle line:90%

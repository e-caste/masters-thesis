00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.530
PROFESSOR: OK, it's time
to get started.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.590
Pay attention to the
clicker questions.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:59.520
All right, I'll give you
10 more seconds.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.680
Not bad, we seem to
be in the 70's.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.220
All right.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.380
So if you didn't have time to
click in, let's consider

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.270
what's going on here.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:28.390
What's true about the
relationship of q and k here?

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.940
So is q less than or
greater than k?

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.810
Less than.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.070
And so you have to think about
what that means in terms of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.560
where we are now in the
reaction and where the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.550
reaction is at equilibrium, and
I like to think about it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.610
in terms of products -- are
there more products now, or

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.980
are there more products
at equilibrium.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.850
So if q is less than k, then
there are more products at

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.630
equilibrium, and so
the reaction will

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.300
shift toward products.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.090
So it's going to move in
the direction to reach

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.220
equilibrium, since k is a bigger
number than q, and both

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.360
of these terms are products over
reactants, there'd mean

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.620
there's more product at
equilibrium then there are

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.570
now, and so the reaction
is going to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.300
shift toward products.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.300
All right, so we're at 73%.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.760
Let's see if by the end of
today, we can get up to 90 on

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.860
these kinds of questions.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.680
All right, so we're going to
continue to consider external

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.980
effects on k in today's class.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.060
I also wanted to mention that
on each of the handouts for

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.380
the lectures, I have the
corresponding reading material

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.460
listed on the handout, and
I've listed it as section

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.970
numbers in the chapters rather
than page numbers, so that's a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.330
little bit of a difference.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.710
And the reason why I've done
that is that we've had many

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.140
different versions of the book
in this class, and they don't

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.890
seem to change the section
titles or the section numbers,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.330
but they do change the page
numbers associated with them.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.720
So if I give you section numbers
then you should be

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.410
able to use of whichever
version of the book is

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.800
available to you.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.070
So that's how I have it listed
now, and the reading

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.240
assignment is also listed on
each problem-set as well.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.080
So when you're going over the
handouts later studying for

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.990
the exam, you can see where in
the book this particular

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.390
lecture, the material
is, so you can

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.820
go and do that reading.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.810
All right, so we talked at the
end of the class last time

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.030
about the Le Chatelier's
principle, and this is a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.200
principle that you can use to
predict the direction of

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.250
change of a reaction -- whether
it'll shift to the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.240
right or shift to the left.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.810
And simply stated, that systems
tend to respond in

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.260
such a way to minimize
the stress.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.940
So if something is added to
the reaction, the reaction

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.090
will shift in a way to minimize
that stress caused by

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.390
the thing that's added
to the system.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.440
So, we talked about adding
reagents and removing products

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.850
last time, and now we're going
to go on and talk about what

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.760
happens when you change
the volume.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.220
So if you have a system at
equilibrium and you change the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.060
volume of it, and here in
particular we're talking about

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.460
a gaseous system, what's
going to happen?

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.370
So what do we know
about volumes

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.470
when it comes to gases?

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.350
We say that a decrease in volume
of the gaseous system

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.060
causes an increase in
total pressure.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.360
What equation leaps to your mind
when I say those words?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.110
Exactly, p v equals n r t.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.960
Yes.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.980
So there's a relationship
between pressure and volume --

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.880
n is the number of moles, r is
our gas constant, and t is our

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.720
temperature.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.360
This is one of the things that
usually sticks from high

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.140
school, and if you haven't seen
it before, it's pretty

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.130
easy to get up to speed
with this equation.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.900
So Le Chatelier's principle then
predicts that the system

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.860
will respond if possible
in a way to

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.400
reduce the total pressure.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.660
So if you decrease the volume
and you cause an increase in

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.820
total pressure, Le Chatelier
says wait a minute, the system

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.080
wants to respond to minimize
that stress, so that it's

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.460
going to respond in such a way
to reduce that total pressure.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.620
So let's look at some
examples of this.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.710
So we have an example of a
reaction where we have two

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.520
moles of p 2 gas going to one
mole going to p 4 gas.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.160
And I have a little cartoon
here to show this.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.670
So we have our p 4 gas up
here, and our p 2 gas.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.750
All right, so what's going to
happen if we're going to

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.560
change the volume
of this system?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.440
So if we're going to decrease
the volume of the system, then

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.470
the reaction should shift
toward products.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.910
So let's think about that.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:26.040
So here in the middle we have
our sort of system, and then

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.340
on one side what happens when
you decrease the volume and on

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.370
the other side we're expanding
the volume.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.010
So first, let's consider our
system when we're going to

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.740
compress that volume, decrease
that volume.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.780
So what would be true is that
the system's going to respond

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.080
in such a way to minimize that
stress that has been put

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.840
forward by decreasing the
volume, and you're going to

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.200
try to compensate for that,
and in this case you can

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.210
compensate by a shift
toward products.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.880
Why is that?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.500
Well, it all has to do with
the stoichiometry of this

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.820
equation up here.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.700
So for every two moles
of reactants, you

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.960
get one mole of products.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.570
So if you shift from the two to
the one, that will cause a

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.560
decrease in pressure, and so
that will help compensate for

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.450
the increase in pressure
caused by

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.930
the switch in volume.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.920
So you're going to respond in
such a way to compensate for

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.310
that stress.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.440
So a shift to the reaction
to the right

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.030
decreases the total pressure.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.560
So now let's think more about
why this is true.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.590
Let's think about it from a math
perspective and also just

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.870
this qualitative perspective.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.570
So let's consider it in
terms of q and k.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.120
So suppose our volume is
decreased by a factor of 2,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.170
let's just make it
easy, and we have

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.030
constant temperature here.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.000
So this change will increase the
partial pressure of both

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.520
gases, the reacting gas and
the product gas, and it's

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.920
going to increase them
both by the same

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.010
amount, by 2 initially.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.060
So let's look at our equation
for q, the reaction quotient.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.620
We have partial pressure of
products over the partial

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.260
pressures of the reactants, a
raise to the coefficient to

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.660
the equation.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.710
So initially you're going to
increase the pressure, partial

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.110
pressure of both gases by 2 --
then your product by 2, the

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.970
reactant by 2 -- but here
it's 2 squared.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.080
So overall, q becomes 1/2.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.810
So q decreases by a factor
of 2, and so q

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.570
becomes less then k.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.850
And so, in the clicker question,
we talked about what

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:47.640
happens when q becomes less than
k, and what happens there

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.930
is you're going to shift
toward products

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.360
until q equals k again.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.000
So you can think about this in
terms of q and k, and you can

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.990
also just think about it how
many moles of gas are on one

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.320
side, how many mold of gas on
the other side, and how are

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.070
you going to correspond, how are
you going to decrease or

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.410
minimize the stress
on the system.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:14.290
All right, so let's think
about what happens if we

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.390
increase the volume, so here
is our system and now we're

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.690
going to expand it.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.760
If we're going to increase the
volume, what's going to happen

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:30.920
to the total pressure?

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.850
I'm hearing it, but I want
everyone to answer.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.410
Thank you.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.970
All right, so it will decrease
the pressure.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.310
And what that's going to do
is shift toward reactants,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.570
because we want to compensate
for that decrease in pressure,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.590
and to do that, we can increase
the pressure by

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.550
switching or shifting the
reaction toward the reactants.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.350
So again, we're going from one
mole of product on one side to

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.930
two of the reactants.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:06.840
So here, we see a shift
toward the reactants.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.140
And so, this shift to the left
is going to increase the total

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.300
pressure to compensate for the
decrease in pressure that was

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.260
a result of this applied
force to the system.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:28.470
And we could do this again
in terms of q and k.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.150
Now we're going to get
a little trickier.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.300
What happens if we add an
inert gas to a system

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.090
increasing the total pressure
at constant temperature?

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.860
So we're not adding one of the
reactants or one of the

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.420
products, we're adding an
inert gas, and we're

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.400
increasing the total pressure.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:58.290
What's going to happen?

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:05.330
There's a couple of options,
what do you think?

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.200
How about nothing.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.330
Why would nothing happen?

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.760
Well, q depends on the partial
pressure of the reactant gas

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.810
and the product gas.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.720
And in this particular example,
the partial pressures

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.470
are not changing.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.960
We are changing the total
pressure of the system by

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.220
adding an inert gas,
but we're not

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.870
changing the partial pressure.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.140
So let's take this opportunity
to review partial pressures,

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.440
or if you haven't seen it
before, I'm going to tell you

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.030
everything you need to know
about partial pressures.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:48.580
So here's a little review,
or for the first time,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.020
description of partial
pressure.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.090
So what is the definition?

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.000
The partial pressure is the
pressure that each gas would

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.060
exert if it were present
alone in the container.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.010
So in this example, we have
oxygen in a container, and we

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.290
have one atmosphere
of pressure.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.600
In the second one there's
nitrogen in the container with

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.470
one atomosphere of pressure.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.510
If you put this amount of oxygen
and this amount of

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.810
nitrogen together in a
container, then you would have

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.290
two atmospheres of total
pressure, but you're still

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.510
going to have one atmosphere
of partial pressure for

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.500
oxygen, and one atmosphere of
partial pressure for nitrogen.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.220
So it's as if the gas is
alone in the container.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.380
That's the definition
of partial pressure.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.350
So let's look at
some equations.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:52.760
So the partial pressure of a
gas, p to sub a, is equal to

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.360
the number of moles of that gas,
and we also have in this

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.320
equation, r, our gas
constant, t, our

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.980
temperature, and v, our volume.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.820
The total pressure on the
system, which is what this two

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.270
atmospheres is, is equal to the
partial pressure of gas a,

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.220
which would be the partial
pressure of the oxygen at one

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.990
atmosphere, the partial pressure
of the nitrogen at

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.360
one atmosphere, that's
all we have here.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.920
So the partial pressure of those
two, of one plus one, we

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.950
have two for a total.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.910
And that's equal to the total
number of the moles.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.940
So in these problems, we're
going to be considering

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.340
partial pressure, and the
question you're going to be

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.430
asking yourself in all of these
different wordings of

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.610
the question is is the partial
pressure of the gas changing?

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.940
That's a very important question
to ask because

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:50.260
that'll help you answer the
questions correctly.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.780
So let's go back to the original
question, what

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.830
happens if an inert gas is
added to the container,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:02.510
increasing the total pressure
at constant temperature?

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.240
And the answer is nothing,
because q is not affected,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.770
because q depends on the partial
pressures, and the

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.670
partial pressure
isn't changing.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.180
We aren't changing the number
of moles of the gas in

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.060
question, we're just changing
the total pressure of the

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.040
system, we're adding
an inert gas.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.580
And because partial pressures
don't change, q doesn't

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.330
change, and if q doesn't change,
there's no response

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.580
from the system.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.290
So a lot of the questions in
this unit, they're not

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.680
actually very difficult, but
the wording can be tricky.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.440
And so when you're doing these
problems, you have to be

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.210
thinking about what is changing
and what isn't

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.200
changing to be able to get
these questions correct.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.690
And if you do that, then these
are some nice questions for

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.820
you to get right on the exams --
they're short, they're good

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.430
questions to go after.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.770
All right.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.400
Let's see how you're
doing with this.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.670
What happens if an inert gas is
added to the container, but

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.550
the total pressure is
now kept constant,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.040
temperature is also constant.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.040
So let's think about this.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:57.480
OK, let's take 10
more seconds.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.990
OK, we're going down into the
60's -- again, we're heading

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.270
toward the 90's by the end,
but this is actually new

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.890
material, so that's fine.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.900
All right, so let's
think about it.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.580
So the reaction's going to
shift toward reactants.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.490
Let's think about why,
let's break it down.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.030
And what was important is that
hint that for the pressure to

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.470
be kept constant, the
volume of the

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.830
container must have increased.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.000
So let's take a look at that.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.960
So if the total pressure was
kept constant, if the total

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.500
pressure didn't change when you
added an inert gas, the

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.020
volume must have changed.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.060
Let's look at this.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.580
Say oxygen is our gas
of interest, and n

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.540
2 is an inert gas.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.470
If we added an inert gas to our
system, the total pressure

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.880
should go up.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.680
If it doesn't, then something
else must have changed, and

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.590
what must have changed
is the volume.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.390
Otherwise the total
pressure would not

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.250
have stayed the same.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.360
So the volume of the container
must have increased if the

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.630
pressure is the same.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:16.220
So then we asked the question,
if you increase the volume,

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.970
what happens to the reaction,
how does it shift?

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:25.670
If you increase the volume, if
you expand the volume, then

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.760
you're going to shift from, in
this case where you have one

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.610
mole to two moles toward
reactants, you will, as the

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.360
volume increases, then you're
going to have a change in the

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.440
partial pressure of the gas --
all of a sudden the gas has a

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.150
lot more room, and its pressure
is going to decrease,

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.320
the partial pressure
will decrease.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.970
It has a lot more space for
itself -- it's like it's in

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.420
there all by itself.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.790
Partial pressure, you can think
of it as selfish gas

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.690
molecules, they don't care
what else is there.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.730
They're only thinking about how
they're fairing in this

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.370
environment.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.010
So then we want to shift in a
way that compensates for that

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.850
stress that increases the
pressure, so we move from one

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.260
molecule to two molecules.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.350
So it's all about the partial
pressure q and k.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.920
So again in these questions
you have to dissect

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.990
what's going on.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.460
What has changed?

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.790
The questions are often
phrased in such a way,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.680
something's kept constant, but
if something's kept constant,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.670
you have to ask the question,
to keep it constant, did

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.360
something have to change
for that to be true.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.500
So again, the wordings of
these can be tricky.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.020
Do you have a question?

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:47.630
PROFESSOR: So, the question is
is it necessary for it to try

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.680
to increase pressure.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.490
This is just the predictive
tool of Le Chatelier.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.420
Le Chatelier would predict that
if the system has changed

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.870
in such a way, such as volume
increases so the partial

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.020
pressure decreases, that the
system will shift in a way to

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.560
minimize that stress.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.180
And to minimize that stress, you
would increase the partial

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.910
pressure by doing the shift
from one mole to two.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.120
So again, this is Le Chatelier's
predictive, how

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.600
you would predict the direction
of the shift based

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.810
on the simple idea that a
system where a stress is

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.350
applied, the system will respond
in a way to minimize

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.670
the stress.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.570
And again, I talked about last
time that this concept of

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:30.610
minimizing stress is difficult
for some MIT students, but you

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.490
just sort of have to memorize
that in this case we're

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:43.390
predicting how a system will
shift to minimize that stress.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.390
OK.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.880
So if you need a review
of partial

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.410
pressure, go over this.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.910
This part, it looks a little
challenging at first, and some

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.250
of the questions you really have
to sit down and dissect

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.830
what's going on, and for most
people, once they get there,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.590
that part, those are good
questions, you look forward to

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.000
them on the exam.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.970
So now, we've talked about
adding reagents, we've talked

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.360
about removing reagents,
removing products, adding

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.780
products, shifts in volume, and
now we're going to talk

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.370
about changing the
temperature.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.510
So here, Le Chatelier's
principle, it's a little bit

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.460
more fuzzy, but it still
basically works.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.950
So if you talk about raising the
temperature of a mixture

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:37.720
at equilibrium, then Le
Chatelier's principle would

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.360
suggest that the system is going
to respond in such a way

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.940
to minimize that stress.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.046
So if you're adding heat, the
system wants to respond in a

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:51.050
way to absorb some of the heat,
to counterbalance that

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.500
change to the system.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.530
So let's take a look at this.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.660
So let's think about raising
the temperature of an

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:07.270
exothermic reaction.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.710
So what's going to
happen here?

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.100
Raising the temperature of an
exothermic reaction, favors

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.470
the formation of reactants,
would shift toward reactants.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.450
Well, why would this be true.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.900
Well, you can think about this
very simplistically that in an

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.920
exothermic reaction, you're
going to be producing heat in

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.730
the forward direction
and absorbing heat

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.640
in the reverse direction.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.670
So if it's an exothermic
reaction, that means it's

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.440
exothermic in the forward
direction, which would mean it

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.290
was endothermic in the
reverse direction.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.390
So if you raise the temperature
of an exothermic

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.570
reaction, you're adding heat,
the system wants to respond in

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:58.760
such a way to absorb that heat,
so it would shift toward

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.220
the endothermic direction of
the reaction, which is the

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.300
reverse direction toward
reactants.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.290
So add heat, system wants
to shift to absorb

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.790
some of that heat.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.450
So in this part you think about
the direction of the

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.350
reaction, whether it's
exothermic or endothermic, and

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.230
then think about compensating
for that stress.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:25.860
Endothermic reaction, again,
they say it's an endothermic

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.130
reaction, it means
it's endothermic

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.270
in the forward direction.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.170
So heat is being absorbed in the
forward direction -- again

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.330
this is just sort of a
very simplistic way

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.240
to think about it.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.330
So if you raise the temperature
then, you want to

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.760
absorb that heat, according to
Le Chatelier's principle, and

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.760
so that would favor a shift
toward products.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.560
So let's look some
more at this.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.570
The predictive tool
here is delta h.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.200
So delta h, whether the reaction
is exothermic or

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.630
endothermic, is going to be a
predictive tool in thinking

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:13.930
about the direction of change,
when heat is added to a system

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:21.490
or heat is removed
from a system.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.710
So let's try this out.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.030
Heat is added to a system.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.680
You're given information about
your predictive tool, delta h.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:49.340
Which direction will
the reaction go?

00:23:49.340 --> 00:24:06.340
All right, 10 seconds.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:42.300
Why don't you discuss with your
friends and vote again.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:55.930
All right, 10 more seconds.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.480
Yes!

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.940
I knew we could get
into the 90's.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.280
All right, so what type of
reaction is this, endo or

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.140
exothermic?

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.040
Exothermic.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.570
And so we're adding heat to an
exothermic reaction, so it

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.350
wants to shift to absorb that
heat, so it wants to go in

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.950
endothermic direction, which
is the reverse direction or

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.040
toward the reactants.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.380
And that's how it's supposed to
work too, more people get

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.950
the right answer after
the group discusses.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.530
All right.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.700
So we've been talking about the
equilibrium constant so

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.740
far in terms of it being a
constant, it's called the

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.850
equilibrium constant, but it's
only constant at a given

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.830
temperature.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:53.670
So the equilibrium constant
changes with temperature.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.110
It's also true that rates
of reaction change with

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.090
temperature.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.440
And kinetics is our last unit
in this course, and we'll be

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.470
discussing that quite a bit.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.870
So how does the equilibrium
constant change with

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:09.980
temperature?

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.050
Let's consider that.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.570
So let's look at some of the
equations that we know that

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.860
have delta h in them -- delta
h, again, is our predictive

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.470
factor when we're talking about
changes in temperature.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:28.180
We know that delta g nought is
minus r t natural log of k, so

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.720
the relationship with our
standard free energy, our gas

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.300
constant temperature, and our
equilibrium constant.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
We also know that delta g nought
equals delta h nought

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.630
minus t delta s nought.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.340
If those equations don't look
familiar, then you should go

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.450
back and review the material
on thermodynamics because

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.300
you're going to need it in this
unit, the next unit, the

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.500
unit after that, and then the
next two units, and they we're

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.600
done with the class.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.450
All right, so good to get
familiar with this now.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:04.695
All right, so we can rearrange
these in terms of solving for

00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:07.090
our equilibrium constant.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.220
And so we see the natural log
of the equilibrium constant

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:15.980
minus delta h nought over r t,
plus delta s nought over r.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.970
And so, it's reasonable to
assume that for the things

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.640
we're talking about, that delta
h nought and delta s

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.690
nought are pretty much
independent of temperatures.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.270
That would be true for pretty
much any temperature we would

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.870
be talking about.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:36.340
So that means that k, or the
natural log of k, is going to

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.420
change depending on
the temperature.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.290
It won't change -- these other
ones are constant at all the

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.300
temperatures, so there's
a relationship between

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:50.770
equilibrium constant
and temperature.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.190
So you can consider an
equilibrium constant at one

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.100
temperature, and an equilibrium
constant at

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.910
another temperature.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.900
So we can talk about the natural
log of a k 2, of an

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.670
equilibrium constant 2, equal
to minus delta h over r t

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.980
temperature 2, plus delta
s nought over r.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.230
We can do the same thing for
another temperature, another

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:23.050
temperature 1, equilibrium 1,
and if we subtract these two,

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.680
delta s is going to cancel out,
and we're going to get

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.350
this equation, which you know is
important because it has a

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.530
name, so this is the van't
Hoff equation.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.380
And at some point later in the
course, I'll be asking you to

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.790
come up with this name, so I
always get very excited when

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.740
people can tell me it's a van't
Hoff equation later on,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.740
not that that's on a test, but
there are very few equations

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.890
that have names.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.260
So here we go.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.180
So what does this do?

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.960
Well, we can talk about the
natural log of one equilibrium

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.020
constant over another, an
equilibrium constant k 2,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.080
which is the equilibrium at
temperature 2, equilibrium

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.760
constant k 1, which is the
equilibrium constant at

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.100
temperature 1, is going to be
equal to minus delta h nought

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.270
over r, and then it depends
on the temperature.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.680
So you bracket 1 over
temperature 2 minus 1 over

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.740
temperature 1.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.950
And this just comes from
subtracting those 2 equations.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.920
So again, you can think about
how the equilibrium constant's

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.990
going to change with temperature
-- that's what

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.090
this equation does for you.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.640
So let's look at some of the
things that fall out of this

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.160
particular equation.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.140
Let's think first about a case
where this delta h nought is

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.710
less than zero.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.830
What type of reaction is that?

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.530
Exothermic.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.480
All right, so now let's consider
a case for this

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.760
exothermic reaction where we're
going to increase the

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.840
temperature, and so that means
that t 2 will be greater than

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.070
t 1 -- we've increased
the temperature.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.850
So now let's think about what
sign the natural log of k 2

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:19.060
over k 1 will have if these
things are true.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.820
So there's a minus in the
equation, let's put

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.640
the minus down here.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.225
Delta h nought is negative, it's
exothermic reaction, so

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.960
that's another negative sign.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.570
And if we're increasing the
temperature, and t 2 is

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.980
greater than t 1, then this
temperature term will also

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.060
have and negative sign.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.580
So if you have negative times
negative times negative,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.460
you're going to get a negative
for your net result over here.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.530
And what that will mean in terms
of k 2 and k 1, is that

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.260
k 1 will be greater than k 2.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.610
So you can think about this
mathematically by running

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.200
through this argument.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.590
You can also sort of think about
it in terms of what you

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:12.000
would expect if you increase
the temperature in terms of

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.140
what's the relative ratio of
products to reactants at

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.760
equilibrium for an exothermic
reaction.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.800
So if you're increasing the
temperature of an exothermic

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.240
reaction, the reaction would
want to shift in the direction

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.870
to absorb that heat in the
endothermic direction.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:38.690
So you would expect that the
equilibrium constant that was

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.170
at the lower temperature would
be larger than the higher

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.130
temperature one, that there'd
be less products at this new

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.260
higher temperature.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.480
So again, you can think about it
in terms of Le Chatelier's

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.600
principle, or you can run
through with this equation and

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.540
do the math and think about
the relative size

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:02.140
of k 1 and k 2.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.970
So now let's think about what
happens when you decrease the

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:09.530
temperature where t 2
is less than t 1.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:14.040
So we can do the same thing, we
have a negative sign here,

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.510
we also have a negative sign
for delta h, it's an

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.030
exothermic reaction.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.560
But now we have a positive
sign for

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.100
this temperature term.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.500
So overall we're going to have
a positive sign for the

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.950
natural log of k 2 over k 1,
which mathematically is going

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:35.180
to mean that k 1 is less than
k 2 or that you would expect

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.360
more products in the equilibrium
constant at higher

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.110
temperature.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:49.190
All right, so that's an
exothermic reaction.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.960
So if you're ever having
problems with Le Chatelier,

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.430
you can go and use the van't
Hoff equation to think about

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.910
what you would expect in terms
of this shift, what you would

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.770
expect if you change the
temperature of an exothermic

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.020
reaction in terms of the
magnitude of the new

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.410
equilibrium constants.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:15.280
All right, now you can do the
same for me in terms of this

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.700
delta h nought is greater
than zero.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.780
Which of the following are going
to be true, and notice

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.190
there's a possibility that all
of them are true or that just

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.520
some of them are true or that
one of them is true.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:34:46.690
All right, take 10
more seconds.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.480
See, actually people did very
well, because e is also true,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.100
all of those are true,
but d was also true.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.840
So if we add the 30 and the 58
together, I'm very happy.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.580
All right, so let's look at
this -- we'll keep the

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.790
questions up and let's consider
all of them in order.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:13.080
So the first one is that the
reaction was endothermic, I

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.580
think everybody saw that
as being correct.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.540
OK, the second one talked about
the equilibrium constant

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.570
is higher at higher
temperatures.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.900
So let's look at
the first one.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.750
We increased the temperature
here, and we see that if you

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.240
work out the math or just think
about it, k 2 is larger

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.020
than k 1, so the second
equilibrium constant is

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.000
greater than the first when you
increase the temperature.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.440
So that would favor then, in an
endothermic direction, if

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.810
you're increasing the
temperature, it favors the

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.760
endothermic direction of the
reaction, so you could think

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.100
about the ratio having more
products at that new

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.410
equilibrium constant at that
higher temperature.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.520
So that one was also true.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.060
Then let's think about when you
decrease the temperature,

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:05.140
when temperature 1 is greater
than temperature 2.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.660
And so this would favor, then,
the exothermic direction.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.860
So you would expect less
products at this newer

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.100
temperature.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.090
So, this part asked about k 1
versus k 2, and we see k 1 is

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.870
greater than k 2.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.340
And then d says there's fewer
products and equilibrium when

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.630
the temperature is decreased,
and that's just the word way

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.080
of saying the same thing.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.520
So all of those are true.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.440
But again, people did very, very
well with this question.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.190
All right.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:50.280
So now we're going to combine
what we learned on Friday with

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.855
what we learned today, and think
about ways that that can

00:36:55.855 --> 00:36:57.170
be applied.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.080
So why should you care about
Le Chatelier's principle?

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.590
Well, for two reasons -- one I
think Le Chatelier had sort of

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.030
a good life plan that when
stress is applied to the

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:12.300
system, one should respond in a
way to minimize that stress.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.470
I think that is an important
life lesson.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.540
But also, it's very useful in
terms of thinking about

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.010
maximizing a yield
of a reaction.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:26.090
So if you were going to create
an industrial process and make

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:31.530
lots of money and give some of
it back to MIT to improve

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:36.250
things in terms of teaching
chemistry at MIT, then you

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.850
would want to think about these
principles, because you

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.890
would want to maximize
your yield.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.610
If you're going to be making a
product, you want to make a

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.790
lot of that product, and so you
want to be thinking about

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.130
these things.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.870
So we've talked about the
reaction with nitrogen and

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.720
hydrogen making ammonia
last time.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.930
And this is an exothermic
reaction.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:03.190
So, there are a lot of people
who want to make ammonia --

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:06.490
it's for fertilizer, and as
some of you have heard in

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:10.770
terms of terrorism, it also can
be used as an explosive,

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:13.890
so there are a lot of
people who want to

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.400
make a lot of this.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.860
So how do you maximize
this yield?

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.380
It's an exothermic reaction.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.910
So you can think about
temperature.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:32.680
So here, low temperature would
favor product, which is good.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.820
We haven't talked about
kinetics yet, but low

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.090
temperature also slows the
rate, which is bad.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.600
Because you not only want to
make a lot of your product,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.930
you want to make it in a
reasonable time frame and sell

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.300
it and make lots of money
and retire early.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.460
So you care about how fast the
reaction is going as well.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.670
So for an exothermic reaction
then, you have to balance out

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.700
what's thermodynamically
favorable and what's

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.500
kinetically favorable.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.530
So thermodynamically, you would
want a low temperature,

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:08.640
but kinetically in terms of the
rate, that's not so good.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.570
So they use a compromised
temperature, which is 500

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.410
degrees c, so that's
pretty high

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.430
actually for this reaction.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.910
So what are other things that
you could do to drive this

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:26.070
reaction toward products?

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.990
So yeah, what's something
else you could do?

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:31.200
STUDENT: Increase the volume.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.540
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.680
So you could think about
volume here.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:39.350
So here we have four molecules
of gas on one side, and two

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.140
molecules of gas on
the other side.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.800
So you can think about
changing that

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.180
to favor your products.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.550
What is something else
you could do?

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.670
STUDENT: Enzymes.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:56.180
PROFESSOR: Enzymes, we'll talk
about that in a minute.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.570
If you can't use the enzymes,
what's something else

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.290
that you could do?

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.340
STUDENT: You could remove
ammonia from the system.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.060
PROFESSOR: Yup, so you could
remove ammonia from the

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.260
system, which would also
shift the direction.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.110
So let's just put those
two things down.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.750
Remove products.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.410
So if you remove ammonia from
the system, and they actually

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.660
do this in the industrial
process, so they'll stop --

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.200
they'll, at a certain time
points, they will remove the

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.070
product and they'll say
hey, let's shift the

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.840
reaction to make more.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.870
You just changed q versus k, you
removed your product, so

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:32.650
now we want to shift to minimize
that stress and make

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.870
more product.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.980
And the first response, compress
the volume, so we go

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.610
from four molecules to two
molecules, and that would be

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.720
favor -- again, the system would
want to respond, you

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.560
compressed the volume, you
increased the pressure, so you

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.460
want to respond in such a way
that compensates for that

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.700
increased pressure, which is
decrease the pressure by going

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.160
from the four molecules
to two.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.310
So both of those are great,
and both of those are, in

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.470
fact, used.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.790
Sometimes when you study
chemistry you'll realize that

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.180
some of the -- people made a lot
of money on this, and that

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.720
some of the principles are
actually very simple.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.660
You are learning principles in
this class that, applied

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.420
correctly, could make
you a lot of money.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.960
Some of the scientific
discoveries are actually not

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.350
all that complicated.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.980
All right.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.310
So someone said use enzymes.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.180
I love that answer, I want to
use enzymes to do a lot of

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.630
those things, and people
are trying to do this.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.070
Now, why would you want
to use an enzyme?

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:42.860
Well, there is a lot of nitrogen
in the air, but

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.040
there's not a lot of usable
nitrogen, because n 2 gas is

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.400
in the air, but it's very
difficult to break it apart to

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.530
form ammonia.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.680
And when you think about
bonding, you can probably tell

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.370
me why it's hard to break n 2
apart, and if you consider how

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:04.870
many bonds would be between
those two nitrogens.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:08.070
So it's there but
it's hard to do.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.470
So the industrial process that's
used now pretty much is

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.465
the same industrial process
that's been used for quite a

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.820
while, the Haber-Bosch
process, which

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.970
does not use enzymes.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.990
And here are some pictures
of these folks.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:28.380
This resulted in two Noble
prizes, the development of the

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.200
industrial process here, and
it's still being used.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:37.250
On a historic note, these were
German scientists, and so,

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.660
working out this process was
important to the Germans

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.420
during World War II.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:47.640
It's still the process
going on today.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.460
So what about enzymes.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.770
Maybe enzymes could do a bit
better than this process.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.530
It's not true yet.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.300
Still the Haber-Bosch industrial
process is the one

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.200
that's being used, but
enzymes can do it.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.630
So, some of the problems of a
lot of the common industrial

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:10.620
reactions are that you use high
temperatures -- remember

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.050
we said the compromised
temperature

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.940
was 500 degrees celsius.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.800
We were talking about
compressing the volume, so you

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.030
want to put in energy to
compress that volume.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.570
And so that is expensive.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:27.130
And you might want to think
about a way, could you do that

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:33.040
reaction at normal ambient
temperature without applying

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.730
energy to the system.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.780
Well, enzymes can do this
reaction at ambient

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.250
temperatures and they don't
have to have high pressure

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.810
associated with them, and the
way the enzymes do this, and

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.720
here's a little cartoon of a
space-filling model of a

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.090
particular enzyme called
nitrogenase.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:56.910
So for nitrogen, and the ase
means it's an enzyme.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.726
And the secret to this enzyme,
how it can do what Haber and

00:44:00.726 --> 00:44:04.240
Bosch got two Nobel prizes for
-- this enzyme has received no

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.940
Nobel prizes, and it can
do the same thing.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.420
Its secret are metals.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.500
It uses these clusters of metals
in the context of the

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.000
protein environment to do this
chemistry, and they have iron,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.300
and they have also inorganic
sulfide, and molybdenum, and

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.230
so these combinations of metals
can do this chemistry.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.890
And a number of scientists have
been working for decades

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:35.210
now trying to understand
how the enzyme works.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.360
It's actually quite complicated
and it's been

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.140
pretty controversial.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.250
So let me just kind of show
you at the heart of the

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.410
enzyme, here all the atoms of
the enzyme, but if you rotate

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.530
the enzyme around and go in,
the secret was that those

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.230
combinations of metals.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.400
And one of the units that we're
going to have second to

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.330
last in this courses is about
transition metals, that metals

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:00.970
can do a lot of really important
things in biological

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.870
systems, and also in industrial
processes and other

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.290
things as well.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:10.130
So I do also like to
mention research is

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.410
going on here at MIT.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.250
I've mentioned Dick Schrock
before, he won a Nobel Prize

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:21.290
in chemistry a few years back,
but not for his work on sort

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:27.240
of nitrogenase systems, but he
was able to design a small

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.830
catalyst that can do this
chemistry, that can catalyze

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:34.160
this reduction of nitrogen
to ammonia at a defined

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.040
molybdenum center.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.050
Again, we'll talk about
transition metals

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.900
later in the course.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.440
And so his laboratory is very
interested in coming up with

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:49.280
better ways to split nitrogen
than the industrial processes

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.710
that are currently used.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.190
Some people are studying
enzymes, other people are

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.380
trying to use some of the
tools that come out the

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.460
enzymes, thinking about the
enzymes and come up with other

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.580
catalysts as well.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.510
So this work is going
on here at MIT.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:11.520
All right, so let's give one
more example of Le Chatelier

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.980
from a biological perspective,
and this has to do with the

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.830
following reaction.

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:23.230
The combination of oxygen with
hemoglobin in your blood.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.670
And the reaction here, we have
hemoglobin plus oxygen has

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:33.970
oxyhemoglobin, so the oxygen is
now bound to be hemoglobin.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.450
This reaction is very
important for you.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.690
None of us would be alive if
this was not happening.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:46.360
We need to get the oxygen from
our lungs to our cells.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.590
So what happens if you
decide to climb Mount

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.040
Everest, for example.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.200
You may be thinking how hard
can that be after a first

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.270
semester freshman year at MIT.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:02.570
Really, I can think more
broadly about it.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.970
All right, how many of
you have climbed

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.480
a mountain so far?

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.910
Woah, a lot of people.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.630
OK, something about going to MIT
and climbing big mountains

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.030
seems to be connected.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.630
How many people feel like after
surviving the first

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.610
year, why not, go ahead
and climb a mountain?

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:18.830
Any more people?

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.260
OK, no.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.510
So you gotta -- you've been
through the hard part now, you

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.250
don't want to risk
anything anymore.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.140
All right, so this slide seems
to be cutting off some stuff,

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.120
so let's look over here.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.050
So what happens to
this reaction?

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.850
Well, as you go up higher and
higher, the partial pressure

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.720
of oxygen changes.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:47.980
So you're going to drop in
partial pressure 0.2 to 0.14 .

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.460
So what happens to
this reaction

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.210
if this value decreases?

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:59.140
What happens, what direction
does it shift?

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.050
For products or reactants?

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.830
Right.

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:08.130
So, if this is going down, then
some of your oxygenated

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:12.140
hemoglobin is going to
a release its oxygen.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.400
So it'll respond in such
a way to compensate

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.280
for that added stress.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.870
So what can you do to switch
it back the other way?

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.610
Again, we want our blood
to be oxygenated.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:31.030
What happens to compensate for
this if you're going to climb

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.750
a mountain?

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.300
What happens in the body?

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:37.690
Yeah.

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:41.080
STUDENT: The body can produce
more hemoglobin.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:41.810
PROFESSOR: The body can produce
more hemoglobin.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:45.320
So you often go to another
altitude and hang out for a

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.880
while before you start
going way up.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.820
And what's happening during
that time is your body

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.940
realizes there is a problem,
it knows about the Le

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.110
Chatelier's principle, and so
it's going to make more

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.760
hemoglobin.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.750
And if you add more hemoglobin
to this reaction, what

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.600
direction does it go?

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.450
Toward products, right.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:11.670
OK.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:18.060
So I wanted to mention
significant figures,

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.940
and there is --

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.130
I have to make a confession
that when I first started

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.570
teaching this course, I had
never really paid attention to

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.700
the rules of significant
figures for logs.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.820
In this unit, the next unit,
the unit after, you get the

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.900
idea, there are going to be a
lot of logs, and they have

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.070
special rules for significant
figures.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.590
So in the bottom of your
handout, these rules are

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.180
explained, it's also
in your book.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.990
Pay attention to this.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.060
It's going to help
you on all the

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.610
problem-sets and in the course.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:54.030
So I just wanted to point
out special rules about

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.630
significant figures for logs.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:01.280
All right, that's it for today,
see you on Wednesday.

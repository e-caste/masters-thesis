ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Tools and topics--

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.580
this is really the first
part of two modules.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.852
The following module's going
to be Six Sigma basics,

00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:35.810
and what I'm going to
talk about in the quality

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.400
tools and topics
is going to flow

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.650
in from the foundation
for what Earl

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.700
is going to talk to you about
in the Six Sigma basics module.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.530
So at the end of this
module, we expect

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.570
you to be able to
describe how quality

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.760
is essential to lean
in achieving customer

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.050
satisfaction.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.290
And secondly, we want you to be
able to use some basic quality

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.570
tools, and we're going
to spend about half

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.620
of the lecture exploring these
different kinds of tools.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.700
So why do we care about quality?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.930
Always have to start with that--

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.690
a lot of times the
cost, of poor quality

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.150
is directly measured
in items like this.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.210
It's, how much scrap or
rework do I have on a project?

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.950
How many service calls
do I have to make

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.930
to fix something that's broken?

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.870
What are the costs of fulfilling
a warranty or other concessions

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.090
that you have to make
to customers when

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.140
your product doesn't work?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.970
But it turns out that the hidden
costs or the indirect costs

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.610
of quality can be 2
to 3 times as large

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.450
as your direct measured costs.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.020
So if you think the direct
measured costs are large,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.050
really, what your organization
is spending on poor quality

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.690
is enormous, because it's
much, much bigger than that.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.952
And they show up in terms
of the excess inventory

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:46.410
that you might need to keep
around, because your processes,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.370
your quality is so poor
over time for employees

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.320
to deal with those
poor quality issues--

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.210
all the non-value
added and wasted

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.570
steps, and queues, and delays
that happen and cost money.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570
And not the least bit is
the reputation or image

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.300
of the organization for
having poor quality.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.400
And sometimes the cost of that
is really quite immeasurable.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.642
So let's start with--

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:10.850
one of the common ways that
people think about adding

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.410
quality is with inspection.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.660
But we've already talked a
little bit about inspection

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.440
in the course, and how non-value
added inspection really is.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.830
So if you're buying
a car and you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.690
have lots of people
who are inspecting it,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.370
does inspections make
your car go faster?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.580
Does inspection make your
car get better fuel economy?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.050
What else is important
to you about a car?

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.620
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Safety-- does

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.912
inspection make your car safer?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.112
Some of you are nodding.

00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:42.820
OK, so some of your
saying no, so there's

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.090
some disagreement about if
inspection increases safety.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.737
I think, after the
next three slides,

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:49.570
I will convince you
that inspection does not

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.220
make your car safer.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.285
Anything else you
value in your car?

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:54.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.535
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Gas mileage--

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:58.840
so does inspection make
your gas mileage get better?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.630
Probably not-- the
takeaway is inspection

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.860
doesn't typically add to what
you, the customer, value.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.920
It may help to make sure that
a bad product doesn't come out

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.350
of a factory, out of a
service to get to a customer,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.360
but inspection doesn't
help you actually

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.610
build in quality
in the first time,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.780
because inspection is
subject to a lot of problems.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.590
There's different varying
skills of inspectors

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.110
and their attention span
at any given point in time.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.090
There's measurement
capability of humans--

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.230
varies widely.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.730
And there's
environmental factors

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.300
as well that contribute to
inspection having widely

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.330
performing characteristics.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.170
Yes?

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
inspection from the point

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.920
of view of the owner of a
car, where really, inspection

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.060
is part of a system of
the quality of the safety

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.566
of our communities.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.440
We are stakeholders
because we own a car

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.870
and we have to have it
inspected, but it's not--

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.310
it wasn't necessary there.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.977
The inspection--

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:02.435
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Are you talking

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.360
about the state-mandated
inspections?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.620
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.620
I should have clarified.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.480
So I'm thinking about
inspection like you're

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.470
at the Ford or the GM plant,
and they're manufacturing a car.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.970
Yep.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.550
So I'll note that
for the future.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.640
Maybe that example's not the
best one to take, but yes--

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.813
or think about a factory
making a television.

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:26.230
The fact that there
are inspectors

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.090
all along the
assembly line doesn't

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.400
mean you get a better
picture quality on your TV,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.217
for example.

00:04:31.217 --> 00:04:32.800
Or it doesn't mean
that it costs less.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.230
Cost might be a value
that you have for your TV.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.235
Yeah, state
inspections-- we'll talk

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.360
about that in a little bit.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120
And it turns out, when
state inspections are done,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.310
they're actually not
visually inspecting much.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.020
They're actually
doing inspections

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.410
that have instrumentations that
are taking quantitative data.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.390
We do call that
inspection, but what

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.990
we mean here is really
visual inspection, eyeballs

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.850
on some kind of
part of the process

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.680
to make sure that the
product is turned out right.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.670
So just to demonstrate
to you some

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.070
of the challenges
involved with inspections,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.190
we have an exercise.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.950
So if you can take
out your folders,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.430
there's an inspection
exercise in there,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.250
and it's a bunch of prose.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.790
So it looks like this.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.880
It is entitled
inspection exercise.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.590
So if you can take
it out and turn

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.690
it face down in front of you--

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.730
so take your text, flip it over
face down so you don't see it,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.110
and take your pen in
your hand, and get ready.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.360
So the exercise is going to
be in two 30-second sessions.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.910
So your first task
is to find all

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.190
of the lowercase or uppercase
Fs on a page of text.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.450
So you are an inspector.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.490
You are the F inspector.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.380
So take out that
inspection exercise.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.070
Turn it face down.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.150
When I say go, you are going
to circle all the lower

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.820
and uppercase Fs that you find.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.750
On stop, I want you to
turn your sheet over, OK?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.680
And we're going to
pass it to the right.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.660
So everybody clear?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.630
I say go, you flip your
page over, you circle--

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.010
it's important that you circle.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.200
Circle all the Fs,
lower and uppercase.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.960
Ready?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.460
Go.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.950
And stop.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.960
Turn your paper over.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.680
Pass the sheet to the
person on your right.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.380
Yeah, turn it face down.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.930
All right, this is
the second inspection.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.480
So now on the paper,
when you turn it over,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.090
you're going to mark
Xs on all the other Fs

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.650
you find that were not
found the first time.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.220
So ready?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.087
You have 30 seconds.

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:36.170
On your mark, get set, go.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.770
And stop.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.290
All right, now, take
the page that you have,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.750
and I want you to
count all of the Fs

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.090
that you placed an X
or a circle around.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.690
So tally up all the Fs that you
found on the sheet-- both you

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.600
and the person previous to you.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.840
And please make sure you
tally separately the circles

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.790
and the Xs.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.770
All right, when you
have tallied your Xs,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.300
I'd like to get the number
of Fs that were circled.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.050
And we're going to
just go around the room

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.330
and just shout out the
number of circled Fs

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.560
that you have in turn.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.910
I'm going to take them down
here on the computer when

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.410
you do this.

00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:25.890
And the next one?

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.770
AUDIENCE: 31--

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.770
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: 31--

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.790
oh, that's a record now.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.290
Go ahead.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.882
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:32.840
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: 36?

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.700
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: So 36 is a
data point you'd like to add?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.038
Well, that's a pretty
high-quality inspector.

00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:42.080
That one definitely wins.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.920
All right, let's go on past two.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.480
So now what I'd like to
know is the number of Xs

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.823
that were caught.

00:07:48.823 --> 00:07:49.323
10?

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:53.130
10-- OK, great.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.770
All right, so let's take a look.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:02.010
So this is a graph that shows
us how many Fs we caught

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.080
on our first pass
on our second pass.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.340
The average is in the red.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.920
And then we also have
the standard deviation

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.020
that's shown, so you can
see the kind of variation

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.350
that we have between all of
you highly-qualified inspectors

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.947
in the room.

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:19.530
There are still some significant
variation in the number of Fs

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.790
that we can catch.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.790
And then the blue column, which
you see displayed in pass 2,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.250
is the projected
average of Fs that

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.570
might be caught based on
the percentage of Fs that

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.850
was caught on the first
pass and the second pass.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.470
And we could keep
calculating that,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.929
if we made third and
fourth passes, and so on.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.179
AUDIENCE: Is that
average the total number

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:43.559
of Fs that would be caught
within two passes-- so

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.900
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.747
Or is that--

00:08:46.747 --> 00:08:48.330
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
That's total, yes.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.640
So that's not this-- the
number caught on the second.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.360
That's the total.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:01.000
All right, so now let's go ahead
and look at our summaries here.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.650
So our inspector efficiency
is running around 68%.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.170
All right, so let's take
that inspector efficiency

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.030
and then return back
to our graphs here.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.200
So there's our
inspection exercise.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.380
This is a graph that shows
you the impact of inspector

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.970
efficiency on escaped quality.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.360
So here on the y-axis, we have
escape defects per million,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.510
and down here on the
x-axis is the number

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.710
of consecutive inspectors.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.440
So we had just did
an example with two

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.480
consecutive inspectors.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.670
And then here, our
different color lines

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.000
represent different levels
of Inspector efficiency.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.110
So 70% is with the red line,
so that's about the line

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.130
that our class was on--

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.100
68% efficiency--
let's call it 70.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.160
So if we wanted to inspect--

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.290
visually inspect
our product down

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:59.040
to one escaped
defect per million,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.270
we have to have more than
11 consecutive inspectors

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.490
examining each product.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.170
Do you start to see
how that adds up

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.723
to a lot of time for maybe
not the biggest payoff?

00:10:13.723 --> 00:10:15.640
You need to have lots
and lots of inspections,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.800
and what did we say
about inspection?

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.100
It's non-value added.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.040
It's really a waste
in the process

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.930
to do visual inspection.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.900
You want to be able to build
in your quality up front.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.750
You want to have
consistent processes that

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.610
deliver the kind of
quality you want,

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.220
and not try to
inspect it in later.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.760
So that's just a
motivation for why

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.800
we need to think
about quality tools,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.660
and building them
into all the processes

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.380
that we use to
accomplish our tasks.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.000
And lean uses a number of them.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.940
They came out of the foundation
of total quality management,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.640
which became really
big in the 1980s,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.320
and also emerged from Japan.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.240
And TQM, as it was
called, was built

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.740
on the notion of
customer satisfaction,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.950
and we achieved that
through employee involvement

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.630
and continuous improvement.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.930
And then those were all enabled
by focusing on some problem

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.740
solving tools, designing
processes, purchasing

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.478
efficiently, and thinking about
your product service design,

00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:14.020
as well as benchmarking-- going
out and looking at how you're

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.780
doing relative to your peers.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.180
But lean, on the concepts
we've looked at in class,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.550
are very much related
to all of these.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.220
We talked about value
stream mapping analysis

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.718
as really analyzing the
process design part of it.

00:11:26.718 --> 00:11:29.260
We talked, at least yesterday
in the enterprise [INAUDIBLE],,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.840
about lean supply
chains as being the way

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.180
that we're looking at
purchasing-- and lean product

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.190
development or lean
health care deployment

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.010
as a focus on the product
and service design.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.510
And today, in the
module here, we're

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.570
going to talk about seven
very common quality tools that

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.930
help you address the problem
of troublesome quality.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.280
So the seven basic
quality tools are these.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.740
We'll start with flowcharts.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.230
Then there's some cause
and effect diagrams--

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.540
example of which is
shown here on the chart.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.200
Then there's check sheets or
checklists, histograms, Pareto

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.120
charts, scatter diagrams.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.580
And then control charts we
won't cover in this module,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.520
but Earl will be covering it
in the next module on Six Sigma

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.370
basics.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.470
So stepping right
into our first tool,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.380
flowcharts, examples
of these are

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.360
the process maps that
we've already done,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.560
the value stream maps.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.740
A flow chart is which activities
are taking place in sequence,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.740
and the inputs of one flow
into the process become

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.370
outputs, which are inputs into
another part of the flow chart.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.270
You also see these commonly
as describing software program

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.850
flows, and sometimes
[INAUDIBLE] algorithms

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.330
are also described with a
process and a flow chart.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.435
So why are these a quality tool?

00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:40.810
There are a number
of reasons why

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.240
we think about these is
helping to improve the product

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.770
or service quality.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.020
This kind of visual
description that a flow chart

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.660
gives you really helps
to improve comprehension

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.120
among a large group of people,
because it's laying out

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.600
there visually those steps
of the process takes.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.720
And in addition,
it becomes a flow,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.190
and it helps us
make sure that we

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.930
are doing each step
of the process that's

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.670
required in the
order it's required

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.750
and when it's required.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.360
So it becomes that tool for
us to make sure that we've

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.890
done the right thing.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.860
It also helps to tie our
outputs to the inputs

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.140
of different steps
in the flow chart,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.420
and it can also assist
us with data collection

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.420
by helping us understand
where in the process flow

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.040
we need to collect and add data.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.360
The second basic quality tool
are cause and effect diagrams.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.820
These are also called
fishbone diagrams,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.330
or Ishikawa diagrams after
the gentleman, Mr. Ishikawa,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.730
who invented these.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.040
And they look a lot
like a fishbone.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.890
And it's a tool for
root cause analysis,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.430
and it's often supported by
using the five Ys exercise.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.920
And this is really to help
you with brainstorming

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.500
all the potential
causes or things

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.310
that might affect a problem.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.550
So we think about the
problem as being represented

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.840
on this horizontal line here,
and then there are usually

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.290
six categories of causes to
help with your brainstorming

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.830
to try to fill those in.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.240
So you want to think about
causes related to materials,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.380
or causes related to
personnel, or to measurements,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.380
or to methods, or
to the environment--

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.090
or external factors--

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.980
or to machines.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.010
Now, not every discipline
uses these exact same six,

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.960
but they're a great
starting point for most.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.540
And some organizations
and disciplines

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.690
have determined their own
particular veining structure

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.300
that they like for
their fishbone diagrams.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.730
And then, as you see the
examples I'll show you next,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.663
there are some
primary causes that

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:34.330
relate to materials,
which are typically

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.450
shown on the horizontal axes
feeding into these spines.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.490
And then there are
sometimes secondary causes

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.630
that feed into a primary cause.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.880
So let me show you an example.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.000
I think that's easier way to
understand how these are used.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.080
So this is an example from
the Institute for Health Care

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.850
Improvement, and it's
a cause and effect

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:56.260
diagram about why tests
take so long to get results.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.840
And they've used the
categories for the main causes

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.950
of people, environment,
equipment, methods,

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.570
and materials.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.280
And so if we wanted to ask,
well, why might materials make

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.740
test times take
so long, it might

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.460
be because there are lab
supplies as part of materials,

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.890
and those lab supplies--
this is a secondary cause

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.800
illustration may be
unavailable or they may

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.520
be spoiled and no longer good.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.290
We may think about the methods
of why tests take too long.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.790
So what is it about the method
that I'm doing with the test?

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.670
Maybe there are too
many people involved.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.490
Maybe there are unnecessary
steps in my method.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.570
So it's not a definitive answer.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.220
This is the brainstorming
tool that you

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.250
use to get all of your
thoughts flowing about,

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.220
what might be all the potential
causes that contribute

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.260
to a particular problem?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.510
All right, another
tool are check sheets,

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.510
or a simplified version
of these are checklists.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.430
But a check sheet is
just a structured tool

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.850
for collecting data.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.780
So we'll put up for you this
purely hypothetical example

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.630
of keeping track of the
instances of quality problems

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.470
in our lean academy courses.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.120
So we've identified these
various problems here,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.760
on the column under
problem, and then

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.040
we're trying to keep track
of all the instances we see

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.260
on Monday, on
Tuesday, on Wednesday,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.510
and we're totaling them
for each of the days

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.830
and for each of the instances.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.560
So this helps us know
what kind of data

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.440
to collect so we can monitor
the quality of the process

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.470
and understand where we might
want to make some improvements.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.620
So I said a simplified version
of this is just a checklist.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.230
Pilots often use these when
they're getting ready to fly.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.510
It's a structured list
of exactly what you're

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.570
supposed to be doing, and each
time you accomplish the item,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.820
you check that you've
done it, and then

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.460
you place another check
on the other activity.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.030
When my first child was
born and I found myself

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.610
in a sleep-deprived state,
like most parents do,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.260
my husband and I were trying to
get out the door with our son,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.630
and we kept forgetting things.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.160
And of course, we were
tired and we really

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.380
didn't have the mental capacity
to remember everything,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.463
but both being trained in
lean, we said, you know,

00:17:02.463 --> 00:17:04.160
we need a checklist.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.260
And we made a checklist of all
the items he needed-- diapers,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.369
wipes, toys, sippy
cups, food-- whatever--

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.079
and we kept them right
next to our door,

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.300
and every time we left,
we picked up a checklist--

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.482
being brain-dead parents--

00:17:15.482 --> 00:17:17.190
and all I had to do
was read it, and say,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.319
did I have it in my bag?

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.550
And I checked it off.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.630
And after that, we were
happier, happier families--

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.640
so yet another instance
of how lean in the home

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.460
is very helpful.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.900
All right, next
tool is a histogram.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.390
So histograms are
typically showing

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.500
the frequency of occurrence of
a particular activity or item.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.000
And from this, you can start
to understand a little bit more

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.460
about the frequency distribution
that you're seeing--

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.650
is this a normally
distributed event,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.270
is it randomly
distributed, and so on.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.620
So we can also use it to see how
a distribution is spread out--

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.870
whether it's very
concentrated or very spread.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.550
We can also use histograms
to see changes over time.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.920
We can look at inputs and
outputs in a quantitative way,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.770
and we can also use
histograms to help

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.510
us compare what we
need to be doing

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.690
to what the customer
requires us to be doing.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.300
And here's where we get to
the sweet part of the lecture,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.440
or about midway through.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.930
And we're going to do an
exercise involving some M&M's.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.630
And I'll ask Q if you can start
to distribute the packages

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.670
of M&Ms.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.837
AUDIENCE: It's already done.

00:18:16.837 --> 00:18:18.628
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Oh, excellent-- they're

00:18:18.628 --> 00:18:19.374
here-- great.

00:18:19.374 --> 00:18:22.100
AUDIENCE: I hope nobody's
actually eaten them already.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.645
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:26.518 --> 00:18:29.060
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: All right,
so what we'd like you to do is

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:35.240
your bag of M&Ms, but
don't eat them yet.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.090
We want you to count the
number of M&Ms in your bag,

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.860
and we'd like you
to do that by color.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.160
So arrange all the
reds, and the blues,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.610
and the greens, and the
yellows, and the browns all

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.700
in different categories,
and then count them up.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.400
And what you want to do
then is take the data sheet

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.630
that is on your table--

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.040
did everybody find
the data sheet

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.790
underneath your M&M packages?

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.150
Once you have your M&M
bag tallied, please

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.810
fill in the data
on the data sheet.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.740
So go to it.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.350
Once your table has
filled in that sheet,

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.790
please bring it up from.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.980
All right, if you can direct
your attention up to the front

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:33.360
of the class, so this is a
histogram of the number of M&Ms

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.850
that are in all of your bags.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.570
So we have the quantity of M&Ms
that were found in your bags,

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.930
and we have the frequency of
occurrence of those particular

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.910
M&Ms in your bag.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.150
So let me also ask you to
look around at your table

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:53.020
and look at the color
distributions that you see.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.970
What do you hazard about those?

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.990
What do you learn from looking
around at the distributions?

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.725
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:00.725 --> 00:20:02.850
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: People
are shaking their heads.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.683
What does that mean?

00:20:03.683 --> 00:20:06.856
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.410
Not many reds?

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.840
So maybe red is
expensive to produce.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.590
All right.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.736

see an even number of colors?

00:20:18.225 --> 00:20:19.513
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:19.513 --> 00:20:21.180
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Not within your bag?

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.230
Even if you took a big
sample on your table?

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.060
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.200
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Still not the same?

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.558
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: And then,
what about the number of M&Ms

00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:30.390
that are in a bag--

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.627
the same, variable?

00:20:31.627 --> 00:20:33.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.730
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Kind of variable--

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.800
so if we're thinking about
quality and we're thinking

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.780
about the M&M attribute that
you think Mars company--

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.793
which is [INAUDIBLE] the
company that makes M&Ms--

00:20:48.793 --> 00:20:50.460
what attribute do you
think that they're

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.418
applying quality principles
to control the variation of?

00:20:54.418 --> 00:20:56.460
So do you think they're
controlling the variation

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.280
of the total M&Ms in a bag?

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.900
Not with that big
a variation-- how

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.910
about the color distribution?

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:07.950
Not that-- so is
it something else?

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.460
I won't accept
that as an answer.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.140
What do you think it might be?

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.910
AUDIENCE: Weight--

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.480
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL: Weight--

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.605
what does say in your bags?

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.470
AUDIENCE: 1.69 ounces--

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.410
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
1.69 ounces--

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.630
yeah, and that's exactly
what they're controlling.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.760
They're not only saying, you
get about an ounce or about

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.593
an ounce and a half.

00:21:27.593 --> 00:21:31.740
They're saying, you get
exactly 1.69 ounces of M&Ms

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.520
in your bag.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.150
So that's a variable that
they're controlling for.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.830
So we can use a
histogram to learn

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.730
a lot about the variations
and about the distributions

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.540
that we can see in our
process, in our data.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.540
All right, so let's continue
with another example, a Pareto

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.410
chart.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.170
AUDIENCE: Can we now have it?

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.370
ANNALISA L. WEIGEL:
Yes, you may now eat.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.870
I forgot to give
you the go-ahead.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.490
Yes, munch away on your M&Ms.
We want the sugar level to raise

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.190
up so that you stay active
and functioning for the rest

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.760
of the afternoon.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.480
So just to give you maybe a
more serious example of a Pareto

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.140
chart, these are causes
leading to emergency department

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.950
admissions.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.310
So we start here.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.060
And this is called a Pareto,
because we have the tallest

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.040
bar starting in the
front, and working

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.900
our way down to lower bars.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.150
And what Pareto charts
do are call our attention

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.950
to the things that are
happening the most.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.900
So what this chart
says is pneumonia,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.760
in this particular
emergency department,

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.920
is a leading cause
of admissions,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.040
and accounts for almost
25% of those admissions.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.170
And UTIs are next,
urinary tract infections.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.680
So if you wanted to
think about addressing

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.300
some of the causes
of admissions,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.000
then you might really look
at these leading categories.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.150
So you might not want to
think so much about cellulitis

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.700
or hypertension, because those
aren't your leading folks who

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.880
are coming into the ER--

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.380
ED.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.570
Maybe you want to think
about these areas.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.090
And similarly, this
line up here tells you

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.950
the cumulative percentage, as
you add in each of the columns

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.570
as you go along
your Pareto chart.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.970
So your pneumonia and UTI
account for a total percentage

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:14.500
of about 75% of your cases.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.440
Just another example from
the aerospace world-- this

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.360
is a similar kind
of Pareto chart,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.690
but done for the root cause
of various discrepancies

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:23.355
on satellites.

00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:24.730
This actually
comes from research

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.440
that I did as a
master's student.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.470
And we were trying to understand
exactly what this kind of chart

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.480
tells us, which is, if
I wanted to eliminate

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.300
the waste in my testing,
where do I start?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.670
And we found that the
biggest problems involved

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.050
employees or operators.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.970
So there may be issues
of training or skills

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.600
here, and that was the
non-satellite-related causes.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.210
And then we called a category
of satellite-related causes,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.060
and it turned out that this
basic design of the satellite

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.710
was at fault most of the time.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.160
So if you wanted to try to
eliminate some of those causes,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.260
you might start with
perhaps training,

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.240
and then thinking
about design that

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.360
might ensure more robust
performance under the testing

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.090
conditions.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.510
Next quality tool,
scatter diagrams--

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:10.530
these are just plots of x,
y pairs of numerical data.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.660
And what we can see from
here is whether there's

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.108
any kind of correlation
or pattern--

00:24:15.108 --> 00:24:17.400
because correlation and
pattern are not the same thing.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.942
Correlation indicates
whether they're

00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:21.690
following some kind of straight
line, like they are here.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.460
So this type of data
is correlated data.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.450
We can say that x varies
with y in some relationship

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.910
that we can estimate
from the scatterplot.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.440
Or we can look at
scatterplots here

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.930
and say, well, there's
really not a terribly strong

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.780
correlation between
our x and our y-axis.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.620
The patterns are
not very strong.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.700
It's a very good starting
point for root cause analysis.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.860
If two variables
are related, you

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.260
want to think about them
in terms of which one

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.000
might be causing the other one.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.730
Keep in mind, correlation
is not causation,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.390
but there's some kind of link
between those two variables.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.940
All right, just to sum up
and try to get ourselves back

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.612
on schedule, so
first thing we hope

00:24:59.612 --> 00:25:01.320
to prove to you-- that
inspection is just

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.560
a very ineffective way to
produce high-quality products

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.198
and services.

00:25:05.198 --> 00:25:06.990
Sometimes you're going
to have inspections.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.157
Sometimes you're going to
do it, but it's not really

00:25:09.157 --> 00:25:11.280
the most effective way.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.213
We then talked about
total quality management

00:25:13.213 --> 00:25:14.880
and lean thinking,
and tried to show you

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.160
how they're closely
related to each other,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.370
and that they both utilize
some simple structured

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.420
quantitative and qualitative
tools to help achieve quality

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.480
as a result of applying
the different processes.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.400
We covered seven--
well, actually,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.670
covered six basic quality
tools in this module.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.060
We'll cover one more
in the next module.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.110
But we want you to remember
that capable people are

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.210
the most important factor
in achieving quality.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.960
So it's not just having
a better testing machine,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.310
or having a better
design, or other factors,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.900
but it's capable people.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.530
PROFESSOR: Last time, we began
a discussion of feedback.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.240
And I briefly introduced a
number of applications.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.970
For example, the use of feedback
in compensating for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.400
non-ideal elements
in a system.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.900
And also, as another example,
the use of feedback in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.050
stabilizing unstable systems.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.680
In this final lecture, what
I'd like to do is focus in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.980
more detail on the use
of feedback to

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.930
stabilize unstable systems.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.610
And the specific context in
which I'd like to do that is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.640
in the context of the
inverted pendulum.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.230
Now, I've referred to the
inverted pendulum in several

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.610
past lectures.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.130
And, basically, as everyone
realizes, a pendulum is

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.460
essentially a rod with a
weight on the bottom.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.130
And, naturally, an inverted
pendulum is just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.700
that, upside down.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.740
And so it's essentially a
rod that's top-heavy.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.840
And the idea with the inverted
pendulum is, although by

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.270
itself it's unstable around a
pivot point at the bottom, the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.840
idea is to apply an external
input, an acceleration,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.509
essentially to keep
it balanced.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.300
And we've all probably done
this type of thing at some

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.970
point in our lives, either
childhood or not.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.930
And so that's the system that
I'd like to analyze and then

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.240
illustrate in this lecture.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.630
Now, the context in which we'll
do that is not with my

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.360
son's horse, but actually with
an inverted pendulum which is

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.830
mounted on a cart.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.220
And first I'd like to go through
an analysis of it, and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.110
then we'll actually see
how the system works.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.950
So basically, then, the system
that we're talking about is

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.940
going to be a system which
is a movable cart.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.140
Mounted on the cart is a rod
with a weight on the top.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.910
And this then becomes the
inverted pendulum.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.140
And the cart has an external
acceleration applied to it,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.370
which is the input that we
can apply to the system.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.220
And then, in general, we can
expect some disturbances.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.670
And I'm going to represent the
disturbances in terms of an

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.860
angular acceleration, which
shows up around the weight at

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.550
the top of the rod.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.070
So if we look at the system,
then, as I've kind of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.840
indicated it here, basically
we have two inputs.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.580
We have an input, which are
the external disturbances,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.580
which we can assume that we
have no control over.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.760
And then there is the
acceleration that's apply to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.620
the cart externally, or in the
case of balancing my son's

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.480
horse, it's the movement
of my hand.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.760
And then, through the system
dynamics, that ends up

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.680
influencing the angle
of the rod.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.680
And we'll think of the
angle of the rod

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.760
as the system output.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.250
And basically the idea, then,
is to try to keep that angle

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.680
at 0 by applying the appropriate
acceleration.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.360
Now, as I've mentioned several
times previously, if we know

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.000
exactly what the system dynamics
are, and if we know

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.910
exactly what the external
disturbances are, then

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.030
theoretically we can choose an
acceleration for the cart

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.430
which will exactly balance the
system, or balance the rod.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.390
However, since the system is
inherently unstable, any

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.620
deviation from that model-- in
particular, any unanticipated

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.580
external disturbances--

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.250
will excite the instability.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.460
And what that means is that
the rod will fall.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.710
So the idea, then, is, as we'll
see, to stabilize the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.950
system by placing feedback
around it.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.190
In particular through a
measurement of the output

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.500
angle, processed through some
appropriate feedback dynamics,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.580
using that to control the
acceleration of the cart.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.160
And if we choose the feedback
dynamics correctly, then, in

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.030
fact, we can end up with a
stable system, even though the

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.760
open-loop system is unstable.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.450
Well, as a first step, let's
analyze the system in its

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.880
open-loop form.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.090
In particular, let's analyze the
system without feedback,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.390
demonstrate that, indeed, it is
unstable, and then see how

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.640
we can stabilize it
using feedback.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.770
So the system, then, is--

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.610
as we've indicated, the
variables involved are the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.460
measured angle, which represents
the output, the

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.680
angular acceleration due to
external disturbances, and

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.260
then there is the
applied external

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.720
acceleration on the cart.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.530
So these represent the
variables, with L representing

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.300
the length of the rod, and s of
t I indicate here, which we

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.430
won't really be paying attention
to, as the position

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.230
of the cart.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:28.040
And without going into the
details specifically, what

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.830
we'll do is set up the equation,
or write the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.290
equation, in terms of balancing
the acceleration.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.080
And if you go through that
process, then the basic

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.890
equation that you end up with
is the equation that I

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.730
indicate here.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.710
And this equation, then, tells
us how the basic forces, or

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.330
accelerations, are balanced,
where this is the second

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.900
derivative of the angle.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.590
And then we have the
acceleration due to gravity,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.080
reflected through the angular
acceleration times the sine of

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.190
the angle, the angular
acceleration due to the

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.960
external disturbances, and
finally, the angular

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.060
acceleration due to the
motion of the cart.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.730
Now, this equation, as it's
written here, is a nonlinear

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.830
equation in the angle
theta of t.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.100
And what we'd like to do is
linearize the equation.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.160
And we'll linearize the
equation by making the

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.670
assumption that the angle is
very small, close to 0.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.200
In other words, what we'll
assume is that we're able to

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.970
keep the rod relatively
vertical.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.180
And our analysis, because
we're linearizing the

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.850
equations, will obviously
depend on that.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.770
So making the assumption that
the angle is small, we then

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.070
assume that the sine of the
angle is approximately equal

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:01.050
to the angle, and the cosine of
the angle is approximately

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.480
equal to 1.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.980
That will then linearize
this equation.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.230
And the resulting equation,
then, in its linearized form,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.380
is the one that I
indicate here.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:20.000
So we have an equation of
motion, which linearizes the

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.260
balance of the accelerations.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.730
And what we see on the
right-hand side of the

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.970
equation is the combined inputs
due to the angular

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.659
acceleration of the rod and the
acceleration of the cart.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.950
And on the left-hand side of
the equation, we have the

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.419
other forces due to the
change in the angle.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.990
So this is, then, the
differential equation

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.700
associated with the open-loop
system, the basic dynamics of

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.900
the system.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.280
And if we apply the Laplace
transform to this equation and

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.350
solve for the system function,
then the basic equation that

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.870
we're left with expresses the
Laplace transform of the

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:09.080
angle, equal to the system
function, the open-loop system

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.220
function, times the Laplace
transform of

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.750
the combined inputs.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.190
And I remind you again that our
assumption is that this is

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.080
an input that we have
no control over.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.180
This is the input that
we can control.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.250
And the two together,
of course, form

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.990
the combined input.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.650
Now, we can, of course, solve
for the poles and 0's.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.190
There are no 0's.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.310
And there are two poles, since
this is a second-order

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.760
denominator.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.800
And looking at the poles in the
s-plane then, we see that

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.750
we have a pair of poles, one at
minus the square root of g

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.860
over L, and one at plus the
square root of g over L.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.390
And the important observation,
then, is that while this pole

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.100
represents a stable pole, the
right half-plane pole

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.470
represents an unstable pole.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.620
And so this system, in fact,
is an unstable system.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.170
It's unstable because what we
have is a pole in the right

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.630
half-plane for the
open-loop system.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.750
Now, before we see how to
stabilize the system, let's,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:25.650
in fact, look at the mechanical
setup, which we

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.540
won't turn on for now, and just
see essentially what this

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.830
instability means and what the
physical orientation of the

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.670
equipment is.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.090
So what we have, which you just
saw a caricature of in

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.310
the view graph, is an
inverted pendulum.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.270
This represents the pendulum.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.550
And it's mounted with the pivot
point at the bottom.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.340
It's mounted on a cart.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.020
And here we have the cart.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.830
And this is a pivot point.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.100
And, as you can see, the
cart can move back

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.110
and forth on a track.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.860
And the external acceleration,
which is applied to the cart,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.120
is applied through this cable.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.480
And that cable is controlled
by a motor.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.300
And we have the motor at
this end of the track.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.650
And so as the motor turns,
then the cart will

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.760
move back and forth.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.250
OK.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.350
Now, since the system
is not turned on

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.080
and there's no feedback--

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.480
in fact, the system, as we just
saw in the transparency,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.710
is an unstable system.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.050
And what that instability means
is that, for example, if

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:53.190
I set the angle to 0 and then
let it go, then as soon as

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.310
there's a slight external
disturbance, it

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.090
will start to fall.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:02.370
Now, you can imagine that not
only is the system unstable as

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.530
it is, but certainly can't
accommodate changes in the

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.690
system dynamics.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.660
For example, if we change,
let's say, the

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.990
weight of the pendulum.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.960
So if we thought, for example,
of changing the weight by,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.350
let's say, putting something
like a glass with something in

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.190
it on top, and I think about
trying to balance it by

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.760
itself, obviously that's hard.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.030
In fact, I would say, without
turning the system on,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.710
guaranteed to be impossible.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.430
So the basic system, as we've
just analyzed it, is

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.630
inherently an unstable system.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.860
The instability reflecting in
the fact that the pendulum,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.090
following its own natural
forces, will tend to fall.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.160
And now what we want to look at
is how, through the use of

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.820
feedback, we can, in fact,
stabilize the system.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:05.160
So let's first, once again, look
at the open-loop system.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.410
And the open-loop system
function that we saw was a

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.580
system function of this form, 1
over Ls squared minus g, and

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.930
that represents the system
function associated with the

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.390
two inputs, one being the
external disturbances, the

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.290
other being the externally
applied acceleration.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.470
And the system function here

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.200
represents the system dynamics.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.670
And the resulting output
is the angle.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.230
Now, the feedback, the basic
strategy behind the feedback,

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.110
is to in some way use the
measured angle, make a

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.000
measurement of the angle, and
use that through appropriate

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.160
feedback dynamics to stabilize
the system.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.920
And so with feedback applied
around the system then, there

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.770
would be some measurement of
the angle through some

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.550
appropriately chosen
feedback dynamics.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:09.490
And that then would determine
for us the applied external

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.420
acceleration corresponding to
what the motor does by pulling

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.210
the cable back and forth.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.070
And we would like to choose
G of s so that the overall

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.270
system is stable.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.980
Now, as you recall from the
lecture last time, with the

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.890
feedback around the system and
expressed here in terms of

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:34.480
negative feedback, the overall
transfer function then is the

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.030
transfer function associated
with the basic feedback loop,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.420
where H of s is the open-loop
system and G of s corresponds

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.160
to the feedback dynamics.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.070
Now, that's the basic
strategy.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.490
We haven't decided yet how to
choose the feedback dynamics.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.710
And that becomes
the next step.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.500
And we want to choose the
dynamics in such a way that

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.840
the system ends up
being stabilized.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.290
Well, I think the thing to do is
just simply begin with what

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.060
would seem to be the most
obvious, which is a simple

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.750
measurement of the angle.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.910
Let's take the angular
measurements, feed that back,

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.770
let's say through a
potentiometer and perhaps an

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.850
amplifier, so that there's some
gain, and see if we can

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.410
stabilize the system simply
through feedback which is

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.160
proportional to a measurement
of the angle, what.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.710
Is typically referred to as
"proportional feedback." Well,

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.200
let's analyze the results
of doing that.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:46.380
Once again we have the basic
feedback equation, where the

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.730
open-loop transfer function
is what we had developed

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.670
previously, given by the
second-order expression.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.570
Now, using proportional
feedback, we choose the

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:05.145
acceleration a of t to be
directly proportional through

00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:09.260
a gain constant or attenuation
constant K1, directly

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.690
proportional to the measured
angle theta of t.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.970
And consequently the system
function in the feedback path

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.400
is just simply a gain
or attenuate K1.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.270
So this, then, is the
system function for

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.270
the feedback path.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:31.720
Well, substituting this into
the closed-loop expression,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.970
then the overall expression for
the Laplace transform of

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:42.750
the output angle is, as I
indicate here, namely that

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:48.170
theta of s is proportional
through this system function.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.570
So the Laplace transform of the
input X of t-- and let me

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.930
remind you that X of t, the
external disturbances, now

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.040
represent the only input,
since the other input

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.300
corresponding to the applied
acceleration to the cart is

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.930
now controlled only through
the feedback loop.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.950
So we have this system function,
then, for the

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.579
closed-loop system.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.990
We recognize this once again
as a second-order system.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.960
And the poles of this
second-order system are then

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.339
given by plus and minus the
square root of g minus K1,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:31.550
divided by L. So K1, the
feedback constant, clearly

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.320
influences the position
of the poles.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.960
And let's look, in fact,
at where the

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.200
poles are in the s-plane.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:48.090
Well, first of all, with K1
equal to 0, which, of course,

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.290
is no feedback and corresponds
to the open-loop system, we

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.480
have the poles where they
were previously.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:03.510
And if we now choose K1, let's
say less than 0, then what

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:09.690
will happen as K1 becomes more
and more negative, so that

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.965
this term is more and more
positive, is that the left

00:18:12.965 --> 00:18:16.425
half-plane pole will move
further into the left

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:20.150
half-plane, the right half-plane
pole will move

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.560
further into the right
half-plane.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.960
So clearly with K1 negative,
this pole, which represents an

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.010
instability, becomes
even more unstable.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.450
Well, instead of K1 negative,
let's try K1 positive and see

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.740
what happens.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:47.890
And with K1 positive, what
happens in this case is that

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:53.900
the left half-plane pole moves
closer to the origin, the

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.420
right half-plane pole moves
closer to the origin.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.360
What one would hope is that they
both end up in the left

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.680
half-plane at some point.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.450
But, in fact, they don't.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.370
What happens is that eventually
they both reach the

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.010
origin, split at that point,
and travel along the

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.360
j-omega-axis.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:19.020
Now, this movement of the poles,
as we vary K1 either

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.350
positive or negative, what we
see is that with the open-loop

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.760
system, as we introduce
feedback, those basic poles

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.080
move in the s-plane, either this
way, as K1 becomes more

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.010
negative, or for this particular
case, if K1 is

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.300
positive, they move in together,
split, and move

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.330
along the j-omega-axis.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.740
And that locus of the poles,
in fact, is referred to in

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.540
feedback terminology as the
"root locus." And as is

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.510
discussed in much more detail in
the text, there are lots of

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.580
ways of determining the root
locus for feedback systems

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.470
without explicitly solving
for the roots.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.700
For this particular example, in
fact, we can determine the

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.420
root locus in the most
straightforward way simply by

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.060
solving for the roots
of the denominator

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.810
of the system function.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:17.380
Now, notice that in this case,
these poles, with K1 positive,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.760
have moved together.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.570
They move along the
j-omega-axis.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.850
And before they come
together, the

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.460
system is clearly unstable.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.510
Even when they come together
and split, the system is

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.190
marginally stable, because,
in fact, the system

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.660
would tend to oscillate.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.420
And what that oscillation
means is that with the

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.020
measurement of the angles,
essentially if the poles are

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.230
operating on the j-omega-axis,
what will happen is that

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.460
things will oscillate
back and forth.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.210
Perhaps with the cart moving
back and forth trying to

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.750
compensate, and the rod
sort of moving in

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.870
the opposite direction.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.770
In any case, what's happened
is, with just proportional

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.030
feedback, we apparently
are unable to

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.250
stabilize the system.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.140
Well, you could think that the
reason, perhaps, is that we're

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.490
not responding fast enough.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.310
For example, if the angle starts
to change, perhaps, in

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.540
fact, we should make the
feedback proportional to the

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.780
rate of change of angles,
rather than

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.280
to the angle itself.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.710
And so we could examine the
possibility of using what's

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.700
referred to as "derivative
feedback."

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:42.770
In derivative feedback, what we
would do is to choose, for

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:49.390
the feedback equation, or for
the feedback system function,

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.020
something reflecting a
measurement of the derivative

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.410
of the angle.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.910
And so here again, once again,
we have the open-loop system

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.490
function with derivative
feedback.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.820
We'll attempt to--

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.040
or we will use this feedback.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.040
And acceleration, which instead
of being proportional

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.540
to the angle, as it was in the
previous case, an acceleration

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.840
which is proportional to the
derivative of the angle.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.470
And so the basic feedback
dynamics, or feedback system

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.060
function, is then G of s
is equal to K2 times s.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.110
The multiplication by s
reflecting the fact that in

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:33.130
the time domain it's measuring
the derivative of the angle.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:38.670
The associated system function
is then indicated here.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.960
And if we solve again this
second-order equation for its

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.730
roots, that tells us that the
location of the poles are

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.810
given by this equation.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:57.100
And so now what we would want to
look at is how these poles

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:03.950
move as we vary the derivative
feedback constant K2.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.810
So let's look at the root
locus for that case.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:17.860
And first, once again, we have
the basic open-loop poles.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.915
And the open-loop poles consist
of a pole on the left

00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:23.880
half-plane and a pole on
the right half-plane,

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.400
corresponding in this equation
to K2 equal to 0.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.700
That is, no feedback
in the system.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.840
If K2 is negative, then what you
can see is that this real

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.700
part will become
more negative.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.220
Since K2 is squared here, this
is still a positive quantity.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.280
And, in fact, then with K2 less
than 0, the root locus

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.050
that we get is indicated
by this.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.990
Now, notice, then, that this
right half-plane pole is

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.020
becoming more unstable.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.460
And the left half-plane
pole likewise is

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.250
becoming more unstable.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.800
And this point, by the way,
corresponds to where this pole

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.930
ends up, or where the root
locus ends up, when K2

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.680
eventually becomes infinite.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.450
So clearly K2 negative is not
going to stabilize the system.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.700
Let's try K2 positive.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.960
And the root locus dictated by
this equation, then, is what I

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.810
indicate here.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.130
The left half-plane pole moves
further into the left

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:35.760
half-plane.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.340
That's good.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.430
That's getting more stable.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.600
The right half-plane pole is
moving closer to the left

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.630
half-plane, but unfortunately
never gets there.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:50.840
And, in fact, it's when K2
eventually becomes infinite

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.600
that this pole just gets to
the point where the system

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.870
becomes marginally stable.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.010
So what we found is that with
proportional feedback, we

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.640
can't stabilize the system, with
the derivative feedback,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.930
we can't stabilize the system,
by themselves.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.890
And a logical next choice is to
see if we can stabilize the

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:19.790
system by both measuring the
angle and at the same time

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.440
being careful to be responsive
to how fast that angle is

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.340
changing, so that if it's
changing too fast, we can move

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.630
the cart or our hand
under the inverted

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.950
pendulum more quickly.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.370
Well, now then what we want
to examine is the use of

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.290
proportional plus derivative
feedback.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:49.610
And in that case, we then have a
choice for the acceleration,

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.330
which is proportional with one
constant to the angle and

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.360
proportional with another
constant to the

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.350
derivative of the angle.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.480
And so the basic system
function, then, with

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.850
proportional plus derivative
feedback, is a system function

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:12.330
which is K1 plus K2 times s.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:17.280
We then have an overall
closed-loop system function,

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.870
theta of s, which is given
by this equation.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.900
And so the roots of this
equation then represent the

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.470
poles of the closed-loop
system.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:37.980
And those poles involve
two parameters.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.120
They involve the parameter K2,
which is proportional to the

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.740
derivative of the angle, and
the constant K1, which is

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.700
proportional to the angle.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:55.160
And we'll, first of all, examine
this just with K2

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.560
positive, because what we can
see is that as we vary K1, if

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:05.120
K2 were negative, that would,
more or less immediately, put

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.270
poles into the right
half-plane.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.280
And the more negative K2
got, the larger this

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.910
term is going to get.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.790
So, in fact, as it will turn
out, we can stabilize the

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.350
system, provided that
we choose K2 to be

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.160
greater than 0.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.410
All right.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:30.960
Now, with K2 greater than 0,
what happens in the location

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.640
of the poles is that if K2 is
greater than 0, and we choose

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.330
K1 greater than 0--

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.780
I'm sorry.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:45.870
We choose K1 equal to 0, then in
effect the influence of K2

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:51.220
is to shift the poles of the
open-loop system slightly.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:58.450
And so with K2 greater than 0
and K1 equal to 0, we have a

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:06.250
set of poles, which are
indicated here, and so this is

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.800
just a shift, slight shift, to
the left, depending on the

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.900
value of K2, a shift to the left
of the open-loop poles.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.190
Now, as we vary K1, and in
particular we're going to

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:24.700
choose K1 greater than 0, what
happens is that the poles will

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:31.000
begin to move together, as they
did previously when we

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.230
looked at the variation of K1.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.500
The poles will move together,
reach a point where we have a

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.820
second-order pole, and then
those poles will split and

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.900
move parallel to the
j-omega-axis.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.100
So what's indicated here
is the root locus.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.990
And what this represents, then,
as long as we make K1

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.075
large enough so that this poles
moves into the left

00:28:56.075 --> 00:28:59.570
half-plane, is that
it represents

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.050
now a stable system.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:02.330
OK.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.840
So what we've seen is that
proportional feedback by

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.330
itself or derivative feedback by
itself won't stabilize the

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:14.820
system, whereas with the right
choice of feedback constants,

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.900
proportional plus derivative
feedback will.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.620
And we saw that basically by
examining the root locus in

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.080
the s-plane.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.350
All right.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.200
Well, let's actually watch
the system in action.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.820
And I described it to
you previously.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.730
Basically, an inverted
pendulum on a cart.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.630
And so I still have it off.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.870
And, of course, we have
the pendulum.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:43.310
And as I indicated, it's
pivoted at the base.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:50.260
And the angle is measured by a
potentiometer that we have

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.240
attached to the pivot point.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.040
And the measurement of the angle
is fed back through this

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.370
wire to a motor that we have at
the other end of the table.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:06.350
And then that motor basically
is used to provide the

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.660
acceleration to drive
the cart.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:09.950
OK.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.330
Well, let's turn it on.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.120
And when we turn it on,
it'll take just

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.370
an instant to stabilize.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.200
And fortunately we have the
constants set right, and there

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.710
we have now the stabilization
of an unstable system.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.460
Remember that with the feedback
off, the system is

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.610
unstable because the pendulum
will fall, whereas now it's

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:35.760
stabilized.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.680
Now, also, as you can see, not
only have we stabilized it,

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.340
but we're able to compensate
through the feedback to

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.540
changes in the external
disturbances.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.490
For example, by tapping it,
because of the feedback and

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.200
the measurement of the angle,
it will more or less

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.880
automatically stabilize.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.600
Now, in addition to being stable
in the presence of

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.940
external disturbances, it also
remains stable and remains

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.210
balanced even if we were to
change the system dynamics.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.950
And let me just illustrate that
with the glass that we've

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.510
talked about before.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:19.340
Let's first not be too bold, and
we'll take the liquid out

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.420
of the glass.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.440
And presumably if it can adjust
to changes in the

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.850
system dynamics, then if I put
the glass on, in fact, it will

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:29.660
remain balanced.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.220
And indeed it does.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.890
And let me point out, by the
way, that I don't have to be

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.480
very careful about exactly where
I position the glass.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.770
And furthermore, I can change
the overall system even

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:47.480
further by, let's say for
example, pouring a liquid in.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.540
And now let me also comment that
I've changed the physics

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.200
of it a little bit.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.920
Because the liquid can slosh
around a little bit, it

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.440
becomes a little more
complicated a system.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.650
But as you can see, it still
remains balanced.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:08.270
Now, if we really don't want to
be too conservative at all,

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.022
we could wonder whether, with
the feedback constants we

00:32:11.022 --> 00:32:14.290
have, we could, in
fact, balance the

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.450
pitcher on the top.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:21.000
And, well, I guess we may
as well give that a try.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.270
And so now we're changing the
mass at the top of the

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.200
pendulum by a considerable
amount.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.890
And, again, the system basically
can respond to it.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.090
Now, this is a fairly
complicated system.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.420
The liquid is sloshing around.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.210
We, in fact, as you can see,
have an instability right now,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.770
although it's controlled.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.060
And that's because the physics
of the dynamics has changed.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.130
And we can put a little bit more
mass into the system, and

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.505
maybe or maybe not that will cut
down on the instability.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.300
OK.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.050
Well, in fact, what happened
there is that we increased the

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.150
mass at the top of the
pendulum slightly.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.020
And that provided just
enough damping to

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.270
stabilize the system.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.030
OK.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:22.870
Well, with this lecture and
this demonstration, this

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.310
concludes this entire
set of lectures.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.270
It concludes it especially if
the pitcher happens to fall.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:34.040
But, seriously, this concludes
the set of lectures as we have

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.180
put them together.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.880
And let me just comment that,
as a professor of mine once

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.750
said, and which I've never
forgotten, the purpose of a

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.470
set of lectures, or of a course,
or, for that matter

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.260
anything that you study, is not
really to cover a subject,

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.760
but to uncover the subject.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:01.980
And I hope that, at least to
some degree, we were able to

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.020
uncover the topic of signals
and systems through this

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.240
series of lectures.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.679
There are a lot of topics that
we got only a very brief

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.010
glimpse into.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:18.290
And I hope that at least what
we've been able to do is get

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.280
you interested enough in them so
that you'll pursue some of

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.020
these on your own.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:27.699
And so I'd like to conclude by
thanking you, both for your

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.159
patience and your interest.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.130
And I hope that you have enough
interest to pursue some

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.469
of these topics further.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.200
Thank you.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.760
FILMING DIRECTOR: Okay.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.010
That's a wrap.

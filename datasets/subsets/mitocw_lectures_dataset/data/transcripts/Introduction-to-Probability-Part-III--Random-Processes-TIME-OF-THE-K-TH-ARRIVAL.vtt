WEBVTT

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.310
We now follow a program that
parallels our development

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.780
for the case of the
Bernoulli process.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.460
We will study the time
until the first arrival,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.870
a random variable
that we denote by T1.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.940
We're interested in
finding the probability

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.050
distribution of this
random variable.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.600
And later on, we
will continue and try

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.060
to study the time
until the kth arrival.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.720
Now T1 is a continuous
random variable,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.270
because the Poisson process
runs in continuous time.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.070
And therefore, it has a PDF.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.550
But instead of finding
the PDF directly,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.530
we will first find the CDF
of this random variable.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.940
So we fix a certain
time, T. And we're

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.950
asking for the probability
that the first arrival happens

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.600
during this interval.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.760
Now this is 1 minus
the probability

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.980
that the first arrival
happens outside this interval.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.060
So we can write this probability
as 1 minus the probability

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.680
that T1 is bigger than t.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.520
But what is this event?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.760
The first arrival occurring
after time, little t,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.610
is the same as saying that there
were no arrivals in the time

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.160
interval from 0 to little t.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.660
And this probability
of 0 arrivals

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.170
in a time interval
of length t is

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.380
something for which we
already have a formula.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.830
Take this formula and
replace k by 0, tau by t.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.650
When k is equal
to 0, this term is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.289
something to the 0-th
power equal to 1.

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.710
Using our convention, that
0 factorial is equal to 1,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.990
we're left just with e
to the minus lambda t.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.479
And this is the answer
for the CDF of the time

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.440
until the first arrival.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.320
We then take the derivative.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.550
And we find that the PDF of the
time until the first arrival

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.700
has this form, which is the
PDF of an exponential random

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.650
variable.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.660
Of course, this
calculation here is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.190
only valid for t's
that are non-negative.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.910
For negative t's, the PDF
of T1 is, of course, 0.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669
For the exponential
random variable,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.600
we have seen that it has certain
memorylessness properties.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.860
Namely, if I
condition on an event

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.420
that nothing has occurred
until a certain time,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.910
t, and I am interested
in the time from now

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.850
until the first arrival
occurs, this remaining

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.780
until the first arrival is again
an exponential distribution.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.620
That is, looking
ahead from this time,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.810
I will still wait an
exponentially distributed

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.340
amount of time until I
see the first arrival.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.490
Whatever happened in
the past and how long

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.920
I have been waiting
doesn't matter.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.050
Starting from this
time, I will still

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.540
wait an exponentially
distributed amount of time.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.250
This is essentially
an expression

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.150
of a fresh start property of
the Poisson process, which

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.870
is analogous to the fresh start
properties for the Bernoulli

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.440
process.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.640
And we will be discussing
this fresh start

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.540
property a lot more.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.890
Having figured out
the distribution

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.880
of the time of
the first arrival,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.590
let us now study the time of the
k-th arrival, a random variable

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.400
that we denote by Y sub
k, similar to the case

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.030
of the Bernoulli process.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.990
This random variable
is a continuous one,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.260
because arrivals happen
in continuous time,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.940
so it takes continuous values.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.110
And therefore, it will
be described by a PDF.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.710
And this is what
we want to find.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.990
In order to find it, we will
make use of the Poisson PMF

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.220
that we have already derived
for the number of arrivals

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.320
during an interval
of a fixed length.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.650
One approach to
finding the PDF of Yk

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.950
is the usual program,
similar again

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.540
to what we did for the case
of the first arrival time.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.470
We can first find CDF, and then
differentiate to find the PDF.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.040
So what is the CDF?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.070
We want to calculate
the probability

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.690
that Yk is less than or equal
to some number, little y.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.740
Now what is this event?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.820
The k-th arrival
occurs by time y.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.800
This means that by time y,
we've had at least k arrivals.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.860
We've had k arrivals, or maybe
k plus 1, or maybe k plus 2.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.120
We've had some number
of arrivals, n,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.320
in an interval of length, y.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.050
And this is an event that
happens with this probability.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.290
But we need to take into account
all of the possible values of n

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.780
that are at least as large as k.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.690
Now we have a formula for this
probability, the probability

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.420
of n arrivals in an
interval of given length.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.490
This is the Poisson PMF with
appropriate changes of symbols.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.880
So we can take this expression,
substitute it here, and then

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.720
differentiate to do some
algebra and find the answer.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.550
Instead of carrying
out this algebra,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.665
however, we will proceed in
a more intuitive way that

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.930
will get us there
perhaps faster.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.110
And the derivation that
we would follow actually

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.110
parallels the one
that we went through

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.610
in the case of the
Bernoulli process.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.690
The intuitive argument
that we will use

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.690
will rest on the
interpretation of a PDF

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.970
in terms of probabilities
of small intervals.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.270
So the PDF evaluated at
some particular point,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.909
y, times delta, is
approximately the probability

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.240
that our random variable
falls within a delta interval

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.560
from this number, little
y, that we're considering.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.870
So here's time 0, here's time
y, and here's time y plus delta.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.930
We want to find or
to say something

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.560
about the probability of falling
inside this small interval.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.880
Now what does it mean
for the k-th arrival

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.890
to fall inside this interval?

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.000
This is an event that
can happen as follows.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.790
The k-th arrival falls
in this interval,

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.840
and we've had k minus 1 arrivals
during the previous interval.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.100
What is the probability
of this event?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.280
A basic assumption about
the Poisson process

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.100
is the independence assumption.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.170
Therefore, having k minus
1 arrivals in this interval

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.490
and having one arrival
in this interval

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.430
are independent events.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.659
Therefore, the probability
of this scenario

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.100
is the product of
the probabilities

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.250
that we've had k minus 1
arrivals in an interval

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.480
of length, y, times
the probability

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.560
that we've had one arrival in
an interval of length delta.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.590
And that latter probability
is approximately

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.920
equal to lambda times delta.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.050
So I should write here an
approximate equality instead

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.880
of an exact
equality, to indicate

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.730
that there are other terms,
order of delta squared,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.040
for example, but which are much
smaller compared to the delta.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.290
However, this is
not the only way

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.700
that we can get the k-th
arrival in this interval.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.710
There's an alternative scenario.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.230
We might have had k minus 2
arrivals during this interval,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.950
and then two arrivals
during that little interval.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.290
In this case, the
k-th arrival again

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.680
occurs within that
little interval.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.310
So we need to also calculate the
probability of this scenario.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.600
The probability of
that scenario is

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.920
the probability of k minus
2 arrivals in an interval

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.950
of length, y, times the
probability of two arrivals.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.640
But the probability
of two arrivals

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.230
is something that's
order of delta squared.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.960
And order of delta
squared is much smaller

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.590
than this term, which
is linear in delta.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.500
And so this term can be
ignored as long as we're just

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.580
keeping track of
the dominant terms,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.740
those are linear in delta.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.360
And then, they would
be similar expressions.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.010
For example, the scenario
that we have three arrivals up

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.610
to time y, and then
three more arrivals

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.160
during that little
interval, which is again

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.350
an event of probability,
order of delta

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.920
squared, that we get
three arrivals there.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.620
And all of those terms
are insignificant,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.150
and we can ignore them.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.790
And we end up with an
approximate equality

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:37.308
between this term and
this expression here.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:42.520
Delta shows up on both sides,
so we can cancel delta.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.100
And therefore, we have ended
up with a formula for the PDF.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.280
In particular, the PDF is
equal to this probability times

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.320
lambda.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.640
What is this probability?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.550
We have a formula for it.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.190
But we just need to substitute.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:04.500
Put k minus 1 in the place of k,
and put y in the place of tau.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.050
This gives us lambda y
to the power k minus 1, e

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:16.850
to the minus lambda y, divided
by k minus 1 factorial.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.510
And then we have
the extra factor

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.890
of lambda, which can be put
together with this lambda

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.860
to the k minus 1 here.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.100
And we end up with this final
formula for the PDF of Yk.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.720
The distribution
that we have here

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.720
is called an Erlang
distribution.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.260
But actually, it's not
just one distribution.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.640
We have different
distributions depending

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.130
on what k we're considering.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.950
The distribution of the
time of the third arrival

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.510
is different from
the distribution

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.120
of the 10th arrival.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.580
So if we fix a
particular k, then

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.680
we say that we have an Erlang
distribution of order k.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.520
For the case where
k is equal to 1,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.840
this term here disappears,
k minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.060
And the denominator
term disappears,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.260
and we end up with lambda
times e to the minus lambda y.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.480
But this is the
exponential distribution

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.730
that we had already derived
with a different method earlier.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.900
As you increase
k, of course, you

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.580
get different distributions.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.820
And these tend to shift
towards the right.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.610
This makes sense.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.430
The time of the
second arrival is

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.280
likely to take certain values.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.890
The time of the third
arrival is likely to take

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.310
values that are higher.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.640
And the more you increase
k, the more the distribution

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.900
will be shifting
towards the right.

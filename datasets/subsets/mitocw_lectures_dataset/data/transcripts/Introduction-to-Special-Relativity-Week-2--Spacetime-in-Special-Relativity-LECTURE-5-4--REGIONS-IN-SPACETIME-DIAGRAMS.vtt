MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.730
In this section, we want to
study space-time diagrams

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.300
a little bit more in detail,
and also define certain regions

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840
in space-time diagrams.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.780
So let's start again with
Alice's space-time diagram here

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.330
in which we plot or draw
Bob's space-time diagram.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.670
The relative velocity difference
is 0.5 times the speed

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.720
of light, and that leads
to a gamma effect of 1.2.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.700
We also plotted the world line
of light in here in yellow.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
Light is the speed
of light equal to c.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.890
I want to discuss
two specific events.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.860
The first one here,
event number 1,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.890
is the one where tA, the
time for Alice's [INAUDIBLE],,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.360
and xB, the space for
Bob, is equal to 0.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.260
So this event lies
on Bob's timeline.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.070
If we read off the
time on Bob's clock,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.000
we see it's 0.83, 1 over gamma.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.550
And here, we can
immediately [? read of ?]

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.310
time dilation for this event.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.600
Note that while xB Bob is equal
to 0, xA for Alice is not 0.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.690
Similarly, we can look
at the second event here,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.340
where we read off xA equals 1.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.350
[INAUDIBLE] 1, in this
case, light year for Alice.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.030
And so now we want to
investigate this length

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.560
in Bob's reference frame.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.680
For him, time is equal to 0.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.180
So tB equals 0.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.130
We can immediately again
read off xB equals 0.83,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.680
and that indicates
length contraction as

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.650
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.930
Important to note here is
that those two, Alice and Bob,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.660
will not agree when the time
and the measurement was made.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.539
All right.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.300
So let's zoom out
here a little bit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.260
and look at another
space-time diagram.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.910
So in this space-time
diagram, again, I drew light--

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.580
blurred lines, or
blurred lines for light--

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.480
in yellow.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.520
And I [? wrote ?] a total
of 12 different events.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.620
Now we want to
characterize those events.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.440
And we want to characterize
them based on whether or not

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
they are time-like,
light-like, or space-like.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.550
As time-like, we
define those events.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.160
We have c squared, t
squared, minus x squared,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.740
is greater than 0.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.030
Light-like are those which are
like light in a blurred line.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.400
[? ct, ?] c squared, t squared,
minus x squared, equal to 0.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.760
And space-like, those
were c squared, t squared,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.020
minus x squared, smaller than 0.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.270
The first task is now to find
to which of those regions

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.080
the individual
events correspond.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.990
And so again, stop
the video, and try

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.140
to figure out whether or not
you can find the solutions.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.150
Because the solutions
are given here.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.690
Time-like are
events 2, 5, and 6.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.330
Light-like are the ones which
lay on the yellow lines.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
1, 7, 4, and 9.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:41.470
And space-like are
8, 12, 11, 10, and 2.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.420
One of the things you can
find, if you are starting here

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.030
in the origin, and you're
going to correspond

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.600
to any event in the
future, you can only

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.230
do that if the
events are time-like.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.120
If the events are
space-like, you

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.460
will not be able to correspond
between those two events.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.060
That's one of the
ways to read this kind

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.560
of space-time diagram.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.790
And in the next section,
in the next video,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.220
we'll talk about causality,
meaning can a specific event

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.010
cause something to
happen, another event?

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.579
Again, this can only happen
if the events are actually

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.700
time-like.

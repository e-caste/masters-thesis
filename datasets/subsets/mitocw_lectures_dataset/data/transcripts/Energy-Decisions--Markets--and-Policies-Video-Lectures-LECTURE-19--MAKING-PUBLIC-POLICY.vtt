00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.390
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.650
Today, we're going to
talk about public policy.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.310
It'll be a little US-centric.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.430
We're going to walk
through Madison,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.650
talk about interest
group liberalism,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.900
other political
processes, and then

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
begin the discussion of that
clean coal/dirty air trading

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.160
filth case, with
mostly background

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.240
and a couple of questions.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.490
So I want to review from
way back in February.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.220
This is almost the
same slide, not quite.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.610
We talked about differences
between market processes

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.190
and political processes.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.490
I will remind you
that governments

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.420
tend to have, need to have,
a near monopoly of force.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.240
And if they're stable, they
tend to have legitimacy.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.040
That is to say there tends to be
a general acceptance that it's

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.750
OK that they make
laws and rules,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.780
that the processes are OK,
that people are OK generally.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.530
Obviously, not everybody
agrees, and there

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.460
are people in various
parts of this country who

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.830
think the US government
should be overthrown.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.480
But by and large, Syria
is an interesting example.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.580
The government has a
near monopoly of force,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.490
clearly has very
little legitimacy.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.410
And whether it's a near monopoly
of force or not quite enough,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.540
we will see.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.880
We will see.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.690
Somalia, nobody has either.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:56.150
So the differences between
political processes and market

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.980
processes-- in
market processes, we

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.160
think about individuals
pursuing self-interest.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.070
In the political
sphere, individuals

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.980
are actors and so are groups.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.430
And self-interest is not the
only thing that people pursue.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.660
They pursue their view of
what's good for everybody else.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.400
An awful lot of
government actions

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.470
are what's good for you, not
just what's good for the actor.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.160
Collective choice-- choice made
for all of us, public goods,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.470
things that affect all of
us, and in market processes,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.870
we think about
individuals' preferences.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.970
What do I want?

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.010
In political
processes, you really

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.780
have to think about ideologies.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.740
Ideologies are views of the
proper function of society,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.000
the proper organization of
society, what's good for you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.610
or what's good for all
of us, but certainly

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.190
what's good for you.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.960
That doesn't arise
in the market.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.845
It does arise in
politics inevitably.

00:02:56.845 --> 00:02:58.220
When you're making
decisions that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.350
affect the whole
community, you have

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.960
to have some notion of
what those decisions should

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.730
look like, how they should
be made, and so forth.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.420
So ideology always matters.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.590
Market processes, we think
mostly about competition.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.320
But competition is
not the only process

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.340
in the political sphere.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.620
Certainly as we
go into elections,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.750
we will think about influence.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.170
As you watch people
lining up behind Romney,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.410
you think about
cooperation as a key part

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.090
of the political process.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.430
And as you see people
lining up behind Romney,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.870
who don't much like Romney, you
see the influence of loyalty.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.830
All those processes matter--
influence, cooperation,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.245
and loyalty matter in
the political sphere.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.930
In politics, power
is a goal for most

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.060
of the actors, a goal
in and of itself--

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.870
the ability to get other
people to act in my interest

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.720
or in the public interest,
not in their interest.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.320
And finally, I remind you
that there is no there

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.850
is no perfect system.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.380
We talked briefly about
this voting paradox

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.180
back in February--

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.700
that it's quite possible.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.279
Just to remind you
what it looks like,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.770
we have three individuals,
individual one, two, and three.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.340
Three alternatives-- individual
one prefers A to B to C,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.310
individual two--

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.240
let me be sure I
get this right--

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.030
individual two
prefers C to A to B,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:56.620
and individual three prefers
B to C to A. So if we vote,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.650
two people prefer A
to B, so A beats B.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.320
Two people prefer
B to C, B beats C,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.490
and two people prefer
C to A, So C beats A.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.030
So voting with those preferences
cannot produce consistent

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.240
decisions.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.390
There's no sense in asking what
the optimal decision is here.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.110
If I can control the agenda, I
can determine the outcome, just

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.390
the order of voting.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:42.860
If I want if I want A to win, I
will first vote B against C. B

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.360
will win.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.850
I'll then vote A
against B. A will win.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.670
And you can see if you
can choose the order,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.690
you can choose the outcome.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.600
So the political system is more
complicated in many dimensions

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.300
than the economic system.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.360
And this last point
basically says the notion

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.350
that there is an optimal
design for government--

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.550
this is something
basically Ken Arrow

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.940
got a Nobel Prize for proving
in a very, very general way

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.240
in 1950 in one of the shortest
doctoral dissertations

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.180
in economics--

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.970
the notion that there is an
optimal design for government

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.480
is a dream.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.320
There isn't.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.360
This says without a
dictator, you can't even

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.740
get a consistent system.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.110
And that's a very
general result.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.790
So questions about any
of this before we go?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.710
We talked about all
of this stuff earlier.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.213
I'm just trying to get you in
a political frame of mind here.

00:06:42.213 --> 00:06:43.255
Then let's go to Madison.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:53.350
So Madison is writing
in the context

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.210
of designing a government.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.420
It's easy to forget this.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.090
Having just read this very
long biography of Hamilton,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.760
I will do a little
history lesson.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.295
When the country started,
if you think about it,

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:12.670
when they sat down to figure
out how the government ought

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.570
to be organized, there
weren't any obvious models.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.240
There weren't any
republics of any size.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.690
Venice had sort of had one,
but there weren't any republics

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.310
of any size currently.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.163
England had a king, and they
didn't want to do a king.

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:29.080
So how do you run a
government without a king?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.530
Well, you could look back to
Rome, you could look to Athens.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.520
They lasted a while.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.020
They fell.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.640
The Roman Republic became
a dictatorship, basically,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.610
and Athens fell for
a variety of reasons,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.260
and really was a
democracy, which

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.510
they didn't think they wanted.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.250
They wanted a republic.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.590
How would you do a republic?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.230
So it is quite
extraordinary if you read

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.940
what they wrote at the time.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.340
It was, like, well, we can
look at what the Romans did.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.790
But if you look at the
details of the Roman setup,

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.530
it was very strange.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.790
And you wouldn't want to--

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.370
people held office for
a year and the nobility

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.320
were the office holders.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.805
You wouldn't want to do that.

00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:12.680
So what would you do?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.660
The first thing they did
during the Revolution,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.490
they set up the Articles
of Confederation.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.910
And that really was
a deal between 13

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.470
independent colonies,
each one a sovereign state

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.180
in its own eyes.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.510
And the Articles
of Confederation

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.070
didn't have any
executive branch.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.090
They had Congress.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.940
Didn't set up any
courts, and the Congress

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.770
didn't have the
power to raise money.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.150
So the Congress had the
power to borrow money.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.150
And Congress could ask the
states to please send in money.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.550
And that had mixed results.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.330
So at the end of the
Revolution, there

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.460
was a lot of national debt.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.520
We debt financed the
Revolution, because the states

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.600
by and large--

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.010
states also borrowed a lot.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.410
So there was a lot of
debt floating around,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.767
but you couldn't tax.

00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:04.850
We tried to run a government
that way for a while,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.980
but that didn't make any sense.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.670
So they sat down and they
drafted the Constitution.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.790
You will notice that's 10
years later, more or less.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.580
So they tried it for a
while during and after

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.540
the Revolution, and then
they wrote the Constitution

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.510
that we now have,
which everybody sort of

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.550
treats as, yes, of course.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.500
That's what you would do.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:34.130
At the time it was
enormously controversial.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.220
It was not clear it
would be ratified.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.160
There was intense opposition,
particularly in New York,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.550
also in Virginia, the
two leading colonies,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.050
very organized opposition.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.260
The Governor of New
York opposed it.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.540
They did not want a
centralized power, which

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.950
is what the Constitution did.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.170
It took power to the
central government.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.370
So we think of the
Federalist Papers

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:06.500
as sort of reflections, idle
commentary, people with time

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.570
on their hands talking
about what we intended

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.130
when we wrote the Constitution.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.410
These were political documents.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.960
Madison was, all these
guys, were arguing here

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.970
are reasons to ratify.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.530
Please ratify.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.480
So this was an explicitly
political document

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.240
at a somewhat different level
than many political documents

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.990
we see today, but it's
important to recognize

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.310
this was in the heat of combat.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.470
This was something you
dash off over a weekend

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.720
and then get to the next one.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.910
This was not written at
leisure in the study.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.600
So that's Madison.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.670
And what's the problem he's
addressing in Federalist 10?

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:54.620
Max.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.420
AUDIENCE: Faction.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.574
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Faction, what's faction?

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.418
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
people get together

00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:02.788
for a common goal [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:05.513 --> 00:11:07.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
it's not just a common goal,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:14.640
it's get what they want,
which is not a good thing.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.500
He defines "faction," as
you said, they get together.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.890
They're united and actuated
by a common impulse--

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.680
I think that should
be "or passion."

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.720
That's my typo, or
maybe it's "passion of."

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.600
In any case, the key
is this last part--

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.280
"adverse to the rights
of other citizens

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.360
or the permanent and aggregate
interests of the community."

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.850
At the end of the thing in one
of his illustrative remarks,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.380
he talks about a
"rage for paper money

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.130
or for any other improper or
wicked project," dot, dot, dot.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.080
So that's the kind of
thing he has in mind,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.900
that a faction might actually
advocate what we carry around

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.170
in our pockets every day,
which when he was writing

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.000
was viewed as evil.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.860
Let's look at--
that's the problem.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.680
How, in a representative
republic or a democracy,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.220
where you want the will of
the people to drive decisions,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.760
how do you guard
against a set of people

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.130
who want to do
things that basically

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.510
trample on the rights of others
or would harm the community?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.610
How do you fix that?

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.320
That's kind of an
interesting design problem.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.010
So let's walk through it.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.800
First, could you
eliminate factions?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.890
What do you say about that or
what do you think about that?

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.830
Could you avoid
groups of people who

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.350
want to do things that would
trample on the rights of others

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.290
or be adverse to the long-term
interests of the community?

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.250
Could you eliminate it?

00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:46.310
I can't call on you again,
because you've actually

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.250
read the thing.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.080
I can tell.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.980
Anybody else?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.670
Kirsten.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
to eliminate the cause,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.445
you'd have to either
eliminate the people's liberty

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:56.500
to choose or eliminate
their capability to think.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.160
That would be against--

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.330
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
apart from universal free beer,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.420
I'm not sure how you eliminate
their ability to think.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.270
He points in another
direction, though, doesn't he?

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:15.350
He says, first you can
eliminate their liberty,

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.440
but then suppose
they were all alike.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.320
Suppose everybody were the same.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.533
If you could do that, you
wouldn't have this problem.

00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:27.431
AUDIENCE: OK, not likely,
given that everybody

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:30.329
can think for themselves,
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:31.590
people reason through things.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.090
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: People
come with different conclusions.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.000
He also points to something
else that leads to differences.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.600
You're right.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.760
He says, you can't
eliminate liberty

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.610
because that's the whole
point of the exercise.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.250
You can't eliminate
differences because people

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.810
will have different opinions.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.090
He points to a
particular, and something

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.120
we see these days, a
particularly important source

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.170
of differences of view.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.337
Casey.

00:13:56.337 --> 00:13:57.420
AUDIENCE: Was it property?

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.400
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It was property, yeah.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.413
He says just the way life
goes, people accumulate.

00:14:05.413 --> 00:14:07.330
Some are rich, some are
poor, some have a lot,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.340
some have a little.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.332
That divides their interests.

00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:12.540
Rich people and poor people
have different interests.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.530
They're going to
have different views.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.520
So you can't keep
them from expressing

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.930
their different views.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.430
That would be to
eliminate liberty.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.450
That would be unwise.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.310
And it would be
impractical, he says.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.510
Of course, the
Communist argument

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.160
was, no, no, no, we should
eliminate differences

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.660
in property.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.040
That will take care of it.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.720
He calls that
"impractical," which

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.730
is pretty good diagnosis
in advance of Marx.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.310
So if you're going
to have factions,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.700
how do you deal with,
let's say, a small one?

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.870
Is that a problem?

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.620
Is that a problem you
have to worry about?

00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:52.640
We don't have tot have read
Madison to think about this.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.650
Suppose you're voting.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.420
Is a minority faction a problem?

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.760
Say why.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.197
AUDIENCE: As long as they
accept the [INAUDIBLE] outcomes.

00:15:03.197 --> 00:15:04.780
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
As long as you're

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.510
staying within the rules of the
game, a minority faction loses.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.080
They lose the vote.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.840
OK, that ought to
take care of that.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:21.015
Now he says, suppose you
have a pure democracy.

00:15:21.015 --> 00:15:22.390
You have a small
number of people

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.420
gathered in a room,
or a small village,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.290
and it's one person, one vote.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.120
Can you ever
eliminate the problem

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.430
of a majority faction,
which is clearly now

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.210
the problem to deal with?

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.790
You have the problem
of a majority

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.870
that wants to trample
on the rights of others.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.410
Can you make that unlikely,
or rule it out, or rule out

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.980
its effects when
you're small enough

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.750
to have a pure democracy--

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.030
no representation,
just everybody votes?

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.050
Charlotte, you keep
waving your hand.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.930
I keep thinking you're raising,
but you're not raising it,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.570
are you?

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.940
AUDIENCE: I mean, no, you
can't eliminate it [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.440
democracy--

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:06.805
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Exactly.

00:16:06.805 --> 00:16:07.580
AUDIENCE: Because
that's how it is,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.520
unless you change the
way they're thinking,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.228
which [INAUDIBLE] can't do.

00:16:11.228 --> 00:16:14.600
But if more people want it one
way, then they're going to win.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.350
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They're going to win.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.980
And majority factions can happen
because you can do influence.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.520
You can do various other things.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.000
So his answer is, no, you can't.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.780
So he says, OK, and then
he makes an argument

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.510
that what you really
want is a large republic.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.920
That's the way to deal with the
problem of majority factions.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.140
Why?

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.660
He gives two basic reasons,
one of which I think is wrong.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.230
Jessica.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.938
AUDIENCE: One of the
things is because he

00:16:51.938 --> 00:16:54.070
gives some sense of equal
power, so the bigger

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:59.640
party that can decide where
that faction is going.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.920
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, I don't know

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.300
what you mean by "equal power."

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.020
He says if it's large,
there'll be diversity.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.750
But push that a little more.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.087
What do you mean by--

00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:13.670
AUDIENCE: A greater-- the
people ruling no matter

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.790
how [INAUDIBLE] will be
able to somewhat-- it's

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.730
sort of to the
[? knowledge ?] in a way,

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.000
to have one of the final says.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.190
And then it's not
a pure democracy.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.180
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
he has in mind a republic

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.810
or a representative democracy.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.140
He has in mind a
situation where people

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.480
are elected from
around the country,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.480
and those people are the
ultimate decision makers.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.340
So where they're elected,
you could imagine a majority

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.080
faction, maybe.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.695
But Kirsten, you wanted to--

00:17:45.695 --> 00:17:47.070
AUDIENCE: You made
the assumption

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.290
that elected officials
would represent

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.610
the public good, [INAUDIBLE]
particularly necessary.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.697
And he--

00:17:54.697 --> 00:17:57.030
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: He kind
of hints at that direction,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.010
but he points someplace else.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.390
He does sort of say that.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.740
And then he does
say, at some point,

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.030
that you can't count on it.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:12.420
He says, "It is vain to say
that enlightened statesmen will

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.450
be able to adjust these
clashing interests.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:20.730
Enlightened statesmen will
not always be at the helm."

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.590
So he points in that
direction and then backs off.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.710
Somebody else?

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.590
Julian, what do you think?

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.253
Forget Madison,
what might solve it?

00:18:35.253 --> 00:18:36.693
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:38.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, but he's not there.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.235
He's not there.

00:18:39.235 --> 00:18:40.122
Yeah.

00:18:40.122 --> 00:18:41.580
AUDIENCE: You can
induce compromise

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.660
by having representatives
be responsible for being

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.780
accountable to lots of people
or by having enough people

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.570
that, on any given issue, they
might fall into a faction,

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.010
but you start compromising
because different sets of you

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.710
will be in different
[INAUDIBLE] issues.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.720
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's a process issue,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.570
and maybe you can make
sure that kind of process

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.880
is followed,
although if you look

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.800
at how the Constitution
works in the US,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.530
you don't necessarily
see that happening.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.670
But he has in mind a
structural difference that--

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.978
think back to what
the country looked

00:19:20.978 --> 00:19:22.020
like when he was writing.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.540
No electronic media.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.920
Weeks, months to
communicate north to south,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.020
east to west, lousy roads.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.750
Most rapid, most
efficient communication

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.560
would be by sail, by the
ocean or on riverboats.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.930
Boston to Philadelphia
would be, say,

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.610
to go to the
Constitutional Convention,

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.390
would be measured not in hours
but in days, or maybe weeks,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.754
depending.

00:19:56.754 --> 00:19:59.880
You had very
different interests.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.760
You had people
trading on the coasts.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.190
You had people farming inland.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.840
You had heavily slave-dependent
societies in the South.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.630
You had some slavery in
the North, but not as much.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:20.040
And he basically argued that
that might be enough to do it.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.040
How could that work?

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.790
That might be enough
to solve the problem.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.320
I mean, he doesn't
say that explicitly,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.112
but that's the world
in which he's writing.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.517
OK, Chad, you want
to take a shot?

00:20:33.517 --> 00:20:34.600
Don't want to take a shot.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.590
Andrew, you want to take a shot?

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.430
Go ahead.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.850
AUDIENCE: OK, so I'm
just thinking this way

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.730
and that's probably
confused [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:48.760
And I think it's if we
have bigger majority,

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.590
it will be smaller
relative to the other one,

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.853
meaning if the
republic is bigger,

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:57.603
then the majority will not
be as big as [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:57.603 --> 00:20:59.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's close to it.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.400
He argues if it's big, you're
likely to have local factions.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.450
That'll happen.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:10.430
You could have a majority of
the people in South Carolina

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.905
want slavery forever
in the Constitution

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:14.030
or not in the Constitution.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.710
They want some law
strongly favoring slavery,

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.430
but that's South Carolina.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.900
And if there's
enough diversity, you

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.190
could have local factions,
but not national factions.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.700
This is his basic argument.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.170
He has two arguments.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:36.020
One is he says if there are
larger districts, if you have

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.270
a large republic,
then everybody's going

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.310
to be elected by more people.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.380
And you'll probably get
better candidates that way.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.550
And he says, let me get this--

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.880
"The proportion
of fit characters

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.880
be not less in the large
than in the small republic,

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.980
the former will present
a greater option

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.430
and consequently, a greater
probability of a fit choice."

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.290
And he says also, "As
each representative

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.870
will be chosen by a greater
number of citizens in the large

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.240
than in the small
republic, it will

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.300
be more difficult for
unworthy candidates

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.290
to practice, with success, the
vicious arts by which elections

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.840
are too often carried."

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.230
He was not thinking of
attack ads on television,

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.230
however, which are more
easily done in large

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.940
than in small districts.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.140
So I'm not persuaded by that.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:36.830
His second argument, though, is
the one we were inching toward,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.040
is extend the sphere.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.880
Make it larger.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.650
Make it more diverse.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.760
You make it less likely that a
majority of the whole country

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.790
will coalesce around a
particular bad idea, a majority

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.990
of the whole.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.190
Or if, in fact, a lot
of people think that,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.200
just because the place
is spread out-- again,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.080
no electronic communications--
the place is spread out.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.340
They won't be able
to find each other.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.670
It'll be harder for them to
discover their own strength

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.140
and act in unison.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.670
So he argues we can deal
with this, basically,

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.400
by you have a large republic.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.430
You have a lot of
parties and interests--

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.600
and I'm going to spend time
on parties and interests.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.930
You make it less likely that
among all that diverse regional

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.900
and industrial and
whatever interest,

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.380
you will get a majority of
the whole country pointed

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.600
in an unpleasant direction.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.590
You'll get competing,
diverse interests.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.070
He also is relying
on the fact that it

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:47.630
will be hard to organize
if they're all spread out.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.130
I'm going to come
back to that, too.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.060
I don't think it's as
true now as it was then,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.900
but there's still truth to it.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.000
You see, this one I
think is a little odd.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:05.810
I once remember-- you've
never heard of Alan Simpson

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.730
unless you really
follow politics closely

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.980
and you've heard of the
Simpson-Bowles Deficit

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.660
Reduction Panel.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.130
Alan Simpson was about 6 foot
5, one of the funniest men

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.778
in Washington.

00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:19.070
And he was a Senator from
Wyoming, a Republican Senator

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.960
from Wyoming, who had
a whole set of opinions

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.180
on a whole set of issues
that were not particularly

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.600
orthodox Republican positions.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.250
And I remember
somebody telling me

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.830
that Wyoming's a small state.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.830
He can actually sit down and
explain himself to people.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.440
In California, you have to
communicate by television

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.260
in 30-second spots.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.650
Simpson can go around and talk.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.450
So it's not clear to me you get
better candidates and better

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.020
positions in large districts.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.820
But that's the solution.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:05.840
And in this solution, you get
a model of politics, sort of.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.330
The model of politics
is a great variety

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.990
of parties and
interests competing,

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:19.370
making it impossible or unlikely
that a big, single group will

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.650
form and trample on the
rights of the minority,

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.920
or be able to get
something stupid passed--

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.660
something really stupid passed.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.210
Make some sense?

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.192
Yeah.

00:25:32.192 --> 00:25:34.150
AUDIENCE: --argue that
the same process kind of

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.213
makes it harder to get anything
passed, get anything done.

00:25:37.213 --> 00:25:39.130
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, the US Constitution

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:44.170
is distinctive internationally
in how many obstacles

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.960
it puts in front of
getting anything done.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.180
There was this great
fear of mob rule.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.160
There was this great fear.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.290
They'd had a king, so you
don't want the president

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.740
to be too powerful.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.870
So you put a House.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.070
You put a Senate.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.760
And you're afraid that the House
may be governed by mob rule

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.480
because it turns
over every two years.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.063
So you have the
Senate that's supposed

00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:07.870
to be deliberative, and more
aristocratic, and slower.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.530
And then, although they
hadn't really thought of it,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.850
they got it pretty quickly--

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.400
you have the Supreme
Court that has the ability

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.190
to say this violates
the Constitution.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.620
It isn't in the Constitution
that the Supreme Court can

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.662
do that, but the Supreme
Court asserted it could,

00:26:22.662 --> 00:26:25.430
and it did, and has.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.330
So the US system--

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.835
it's actually hard to explain
to people outside the US

00:26:30.835 --> 00:26:32.710
that we do not have a
government in the sense

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.150
that they have a government.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.320
In a parliamentary
system, the coalition that

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.180
controls parliament
names the prime minister.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.080
If the government of which
the prime minister is the head

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.810
introduces a major law
or introduces a budget

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.560
and it doesn't pass,
the government falls.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.320
You have another election.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.360
So when the prime
minister says we're

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.500
going to ratify this treaty,
he either ratifies the treaty

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.170
or he's gone.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.460
We have nothing like that.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.910
We don't have a government
that can make promises.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.223
Most countries do.

00:27:08.223 --> 00:27:08.890
So you're right.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:12.790
We set it up so we
don't have a king.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.640
We don't have the House of
Representatives in charge.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.580
To a first approximation, we
don't have anybody in charge.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.770
Now, in the 18th century, this
was considered a good thing.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.870
It still has its merits.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:31.720
It means it's hard
to act in haste.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.180
One of the critiques of
parliamentary systems

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.610
is they can go from a
set of left-wing policies

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.910
to a set of right-wing
policies with one election.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:44.410
We move more slowly,
for better or for worse.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.840
But you're right--
the whole Constitution

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.800
is designed to prevent action
to a first approximation.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:59.510
OK, Madison's model, then,
is one of competing interest

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.010
groups.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.530
Factions are inevitable,
but if they're weak,

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.530
if they're small and
weak, they don't dominate.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.310
And it's interesting--
if you go from Madison,

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.210
and I must say I'm sure you all
find [? Loewy ?] easy to read.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.740
I find him almost
incomprehensible,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.530
but this is a standard text.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:28.380
He argues-- this is written
in the '60s, but I think

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.290
it's still implicitly true--

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.230
that competition
among interest groups

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:40.400
has been both an accepted
description of US politics,

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.440
and politics in
some other settings,

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.410
and implicitly, an ideal.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.800
If you go to Washington
and look in the phone book,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.600
look in buildings on K
Street, you will see--

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.300
I spoke yesterday
to an interest group

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.260
composed of large industrial
users of electricity.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.320
I was preceded by a spokesperson
for the American Public Power

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.000
Association, which represents
municipal and cooperative power

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.720
consumers.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.540
We were sharing quarters with
the American Forest Products

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:22.580
Association, which
represents timber harvesters.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.850
You can go up and
down the street

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.130
and there's the
Department of Agriculture,

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.430
set up as an interest
group, basically,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.740
to represent the farm
community, and on, and on.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.485
So the argument [? Loewy ?]
makes is that we've moved.

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:39.860
And I think though
he was writing

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.780
in the '60s that isn't bad.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.550
That has become both an
accepted description.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.290
Think about how
politics are described

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.040
in the press, not presidential
politics, but any kind

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.840
of legislative decision.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.530
The environmental community,
the Black community, women--

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:02.450
we describe the political
process in terms of groups,

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.470
often--

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.270
the Cuban community in
Atlanta, blah, blah, blah.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.540
I mean, we do a lot
of group description.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:16.050
And it's almost--
here's the next step--

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.460
it's viewed as a good thing.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.730
And the question is,
is it a good thing?

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.700
First of all, is it an accurate
description of politics?

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.380
And I'll come back to that--
sometimes yes, sometimes no.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.240
But first, [? Loewy ?] has
a nice, little statement

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:43.340
about if politics looked like
that, could it be a good thing?

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.780
And he argues you'd sort
of need three pieces.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.390
First, you'd need
clearly defined groups.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.450
Large consumers of electricity
is a pretty clearly defined

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.580
group, but you can see it blurs.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.570
But certainly cooperative
and municipal utilities

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.730
that buy electricity--
that's a well-defined group.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.120
The Forest Products
Association probably is.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.010
And then there's this--

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.050
I think of it mathematically
as [? spanning-- ?]

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:21.350
the notion is that the
organized groups pretty much

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.480
cover the universe.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.460
Pretty much every
interest that matters

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.110
is represented well
by an organized group,

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.430
so that everybody's covered.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.610
Everybody has a group, or not
everybody, every interest.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.790
So you may be represented
by several groups,

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.970
depending on what you're
thinking about at the moment.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.750
And then if you believe that
as a statement of ideology,

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.793
as a statement about how
the world should work,

00:31:47.793 --> 00:31:49.460
that the role of
government is basically

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:54.510
to balance and reconcile, to
do deals among various groups.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.130
You ensure access so all
groups can participate.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.290
And this is his language--

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.930
"You ratify the
agreements and adjustments

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.600
worked out among them."

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.440
So again, you hear
legislative deals in Congress.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.810
And we'll talk about
at length the time

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.820
after next in this case where
people explicitly say, look,

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.290
these guys won in Congress.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.450
And so our job is to
make sure they get it.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.580
They get the fruits
of their victory.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:32.310
So do those makes sense as
descriptions of the world

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.450
as you know it?

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.540
Does that make sense as a
description of a good world?

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.080
Catherine.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:52.200
AUDIENCE: So I agree that
having organized [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.963
but the problem that he talked
about business interests,

00:32:54.963 --> 00:32:56.380
like generally the
interest group,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.772
but there was money [INAUDIBLE]
given that Representatives

00:33:00.772 --> 00:33:05.140
in the Senate and House,
they want to get re-elected.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.770
And so the group that
has the most money

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.257
can have a larger [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:11.257 --> 00:33:13.840
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you're
pointing-- and I think I would,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.470
too--

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:23.020
you're pointing sort of to the
second of those assumptions,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.350
particularly the "adequately
represent" part of it.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:31.930
So what you're saying is not
all groups are created equal.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.370
I think that's fair.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.680
Are all possible
interests represented

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.770
by organized groups?

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:45.130
AUDIENCE: No, but I think
that a group has a view,

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:50.100
and if New York was [INAUDIBLE]
large enough to influence,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.866
then I think [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:54.528 --> 00:33:56.570
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Who
represents the interests

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.380
of mobile phone users?

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.830
Is there an organized group?

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.150
Or buyers of milk--

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.040
we have a federal
milk price support

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.159
program that's designed to
raise the price of whole milk.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:18.250
The dairy farmers are an
effectively organized group.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:22.320
People who give milk to
their kids, not so much.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.810
So I would point to both parts.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.659
I agree with you.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.360
I agree with you on the second--

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.770
not all groups
are created equal,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.889
so you don't necessarily get the
kind of balance you might like.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.730
But I'm not sure
they fill up most

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.730
of the sectors of our lives.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:46.070
And what's
interesting-- yesterday

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.050
was a good day for anecdotes.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:52.520
So the speaker from the
Public Power Association

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.520
said she was very
happy to be addressing

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.810
these large industrial
consumers because, she said,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.540
your group and my group
are the only ones that

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.710
represent consumers of
electricity, which probably

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.580
makes sense.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.290
Small businesses aren't
represented in Washington

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.410
as consumers of electricity.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.240
There is a National Federation
of independent Businesses,

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.210
but it's got a lot of issues.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.570
Nobody's representing me as
a consumer of electricity,

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.150
as far as I can tell.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:33.310
So when we were talking
particularly about the FERC,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.970
when there is a proceeding,
a regulatory proceeding

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.590
at the FERC, a notice goes out.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.430
You don't see it.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.750
I don't see it.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.350
They see it.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.070
That's their job.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.270
They're in Washington.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.040
And they respond to it.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.480
And with some luck, they respond
as consumers of electricity,

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.980
but they're consumers
of electricity

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.520
with particular interests.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.840
They don't necessarily
represent me.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:01.172 --> 00:36:02.630
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, but look

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.560
at all the residential
users of electricity.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.160
That's a lot of volume.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.090
Hard to organize,
though, hard to organize.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.090
So that's one kicker.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.170
Anybody else?

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.770
I picked on Catherine enough.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:17.270
Charlotte.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.263
AUDIENCE: I just had a question.

00:36:19.263 --> 00:36:21.680
So one of the things you were
listing earlier about things

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.263
that Madison was
considering factions,

00:36:23.263 --> 00:36:24.890
like slavery or
trade, those are all

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.560
things that I think of as having
to go with a political party,

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.270
whereas the things you're
talking about now as factions

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.590
are things that I wouldn't
think about having

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.798
to do with a political party.

00:36:31.798 --> 00:36:34.760
So I guess how is
Madison relating factions

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.183
to political parties or
what was the situation then?

00:36:37.183 --> 00:36:38.600
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
They actually

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.540
hoped, a number
of them early on,

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.387
that you wouldn't have parties,
which was really pretty--

00:36:44.387 --> 00:36:45.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.440
AUDIENCE: There'd been
a loyalist person that

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.868
[? hadn't ?] developed
another one yet [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:48.868 --> 00:36:50.660
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
No, I mean, Washington

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.910
had sufficient
charisma that until you

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.440
began to coalesce opposition to
Washington, and in particular

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.940
to Hamilton--

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.890
Hamilton had a particular agenda
for the central government,

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.620
which is to strengthen it.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:09.230
And Jefferson, and soon
Madison, opposed that strongly.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.616
But--

00:37:11.616 --> 00:37:16.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] also
some sort faction [INAUDIBLE]??

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.720
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It's interesting.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.420
And that was a fear,
that if you manage

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.370
to get a large
parity as faction,

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.618
you could have exactly
the problem that Madison

00:37:31.618 --> 00:37:34.160
thought of, which is one reason
why they didn't like parties.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:43.580
Traditionally, American
political parties

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.010
have been pretty big tents.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:50.210
They've represented a lot
of different interests

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.940
that didn't see eye
to eye on all issues.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.520
In the European tradition,
parties tended to be narrower.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.400
So you'll have the
Labor Party in Britain,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.820
which is was a left
party, but traditionally

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.150
really was aligned with
the labor movement,

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.660
as the Democratic
Party was and is,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.500
but much more tightly
than the Democratic Party.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.630
So I think it depends on
the nature of the party.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.670
And in some
parliamentary systems,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.040
you have very little
parties that are

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.140
focused on particular issues.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.780
Think about the ultra-orthodox
parties in Israel,

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.290
for instance, or some
of the far left parties

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.380
in European politics.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.410
Our parties have traditionally
not been easily identified

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.180
with particular factions.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.790
And there isn't a--

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:39.260
well, I'm going to
talk about this,

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.120
but most of the interest groups
we see in the US try very hard

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.700
not to be identified with
one party or another.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.108
Because you don't want
to-- if you could possibly

00:38:49.108 --> 00:38:50.900
be friends with everybody,
you can survive.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:59.660
Pro-choice, pro-life, they have
not been able to do that trick.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.270
There's a Republican side
and a Democratic side,

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.890
and there they are.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:09.020
But most-- the Forest Products
Association, I am sure,

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.200
contributes to people
from both parties.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.540
The large consumers of
electricity, I'm sure,

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.260
contribute to people,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.920
So good question, though.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.230
Anything else?

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:30.110
OK, so I guess I'm
inclined to agree with,

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:35.780
I think with Catherine,
that this probably doesn't

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.603
work as well as one might like.

00:39:38.603 --> 00:39:40.520
I don't know whether
it's an ideal, whether it

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.770
would work as an ideal or not.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.600
It's not a bad story.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.890
But the notion that pretty much
all interests are represented

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:54.560
and they're well represented,
and that government is about--

00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:00.050
modulo the role of parties--
is about refereeing agreements

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.670
and adjustments among
interest groups,

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.790
is not a bad
description sometimes--

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.540
sometimes.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.820
Once again, sometimes.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.580
But I'm not sure it's an ideal.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.990
OK, let me move on.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.870
A little bit about interest
group competition--

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:26.720
first, if you think
about interest groups,

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.730
their ability to
organize is really key.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.620
Those large consumers
of electricity--

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.792
there are about 40 of them--

00:40:35.792 --> 00:40:37.640
they're the big
industrial buyers.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.280
They sit in a room.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.555
Small consumers of electricity--
there are many of us.

00:40:43.555 --> 00:40:44.930
We also have
different interests.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.638
We're in different
parts of the country--

00:40:46.638 --> 00:40:48.350
hard to organize.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:53.120
The more important an issue is--

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.323
that should be higher
dollar "stake," not "stage."

00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:58.490
I'm looking at that and
saying that makes no sense--

00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.990
"stake."

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.240
Electricity is 2% of the
average family budget.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.950
You're not going to
get families to rally

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.930
around electricity rate reform.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.610
It's just not important enough.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.040
It's a big deal to the big guys.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.380
They'll send people
to Washington.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.710
And there are a small number
of them, so they organize.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:26.060
So a classic example is debates
about airline deregulation

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:26.970
back in the '70s.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.000
The airlines were
well organized,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.700
were very important in Congress.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.560
Most did not want
to be deregulated,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.260
thank you very much.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.050
Travelers did not have
an interest group.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.210
There is an Airline
Passengers Association.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.920
I have no idea
who belongs to it,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.820
but not a particularly
important group.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.860
Nonetheless, they
were deregulated,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.510
something we may come back to.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.580
But the shorthand in politics
is a concentrated interest,

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.010
an interest that affects
a small number of people

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.290
and has a big
stake for each one,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.580
tends to be a potent interest.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.080
So back to are all interest
groups created equal?

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.640
Well, no.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.950
Some groups don't organize.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.280
Back to regulating
electric utilities--

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.980
the utility cares
an enormous amount

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.060
about the outcome of regulation.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.570
Those of us who buy
care a little bit.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.550
There are a lot of us.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.100
We don't have that
much influence,

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.630
except from time to time.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:31.130
So a key factor is how easy
is it to organize in terms

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:35.120
of interest group competition.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:44.430
Money-- money is interesting.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:48.690
The simple assumption
is that you buy votes

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:52.740
with campaign contributions,
and some of that does happen.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.130
But if you look at the
pattern of spending,

00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.353
people contribute to
politicians of both sides.

00:43:00.353 --> 00:43:02.520
If you become chairman of
a congressional committee,

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.590
you will get campaign
contributions

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:08.742
from anybody your
committee touches.

00:43:08.742 --> 00:43:10.950
Usually, what you want to
do is you want to make sure

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.300
your friends win.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.940
It's harder to make somebody
make a 180-degree turn, or even

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.190
a 90-degree turn
on an issue than it

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:24.730
is to elect somebody who
already agrees with you.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.940
So an awful lot of what
goes on is electing friends

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.320
and getting access.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.820
Getting access-- if you've given
a lot of money to somebody,

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.100
they will return
your phone call.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.450
But it's amazing--
people who have

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:44.350
no challenge, no
effective opposition,

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.130
will get campaign contributions
from people who disagree

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.380
with them on issues,
just because I want

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.990
to be able to get in the door.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.880
I want you to think well of me.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.340
If I think you can be beaten
by somebody who I like better,

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.890
I will pay a lot for them.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:02.830
But it's pretty
hard to buy votes

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.330
with campaign contributions.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.270
The other thing-- and this
all merits discussion--

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.120
the other thing that
has to be mentioned

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:14.290
is the Citizens United decision,
which is this recent Supreme

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.030
Court decision that
said corporations

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:20.280
are people and limits on
spending are limits on speech.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.000
So you saw it in the primary.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.670
You didn't see it
here particularly,

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:29.070
but other people saw it.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.690
There's really no
limit on what can

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:37.750
be spent to support a candidate
by wealthy individuals,

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.070
mainly, more than corporations.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:43.360
We talked about corporate
political action.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.620
But that may change
things dramatically.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:52.330
And it goes back to
Catherine's point about money.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.210
If you're free to
speak with your $5,

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.670
and I'm free to speak
with my $50 million,

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.150
we have different impact.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:05.350
So can I get my friends elected?

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.990
Well, yeah, probably.

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.550
Can I buy votes with it?

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:10.540
Buying votes is hard.

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.850
Getting friends
elected is easier.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.980
So we're going to
see more of that.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.800
We're going to see a lot of--

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.420
this will be a very ugly Fall.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.920
That's all I have to say.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.060
Comments on any of this before
I go to the last one, last point

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:28.600
here?

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.620
Reactions, thoughts?

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.370
Jacob, you look disturbed.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.250
David is disturbed.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:35.750
David.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.970
AUDIENCE: Don't [INAUDIBLE]
speak with their money,

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:41.160
and you determine what
you care about more.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.238
So I buy electricity.

00:45:43.238 --> 00:45:45.530
It's only 2% of what I have,
so I don't care about that

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.650
that much, but maybe I care
more about milk or something.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.330
So how do I choose?

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.420
How do I vote what
percentage of my care

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.060
I want to send each group?

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.638
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:01.638 --> 00:46:03.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I
mean, you as an individual

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.150
or you as a really rich person?

00:46:07.287 --> 00:46:09.370
AUDIENCE: Rich people are
individuals, too, right?

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:17.710
Which are you imagining yourself
to be, you or a Warren Buffett?

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.240
Because the answer differs.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.053
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah,
for someone who maybe

00:46:22.053 --> 00:46:23.220
doesn't have a lot of money.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.595
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Somebody who

00:46:24.595 --> 00:46:26.830
doesn't have a lot of
money, you basically

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.630
belong to an organization.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:31.360
You care about gun rights, you
belong to the National Rifle

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.530
Association.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:38.170
You care about
abortion, you contribute

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:42.430
to the National Abortion Rights
Act, whatever the thing is,

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.560
or Planned Parenthood.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.040
You can contribute
to organizations

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.100
or you can contribute
to candidates.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:55.750
If you're Warren Buffett, you
can set up a political action

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.970
committee--

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:01.750
he doesn't do this-- put a
few tens of millions of in it,

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.510
look around the country
for candidates you like,

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.197
and spend for them.

00:47:06.197 --> 00:47:07.280
You can't give it to them.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.920
You can spend for them.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.750
You can hire people
to write attack ads

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:15.300
against their opponents and put
a lot of money in television,

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.100
or you can also find
interest groups.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.030
AUDIENCE: My question is
if I care a lot about--

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.900
I have a [INAUDIBLE] because
I buy electricity [INAUDIBLE],,

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.200
but maybe I really care
about guns or something.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.710
So what would the
ideal system be

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.680
in which I can have interest
in all these different groups,

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.150
but the ones that I care about
more get more of my support.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.520
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
if there are organizations--

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.110
I mean, the National
Rifle Association

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.525
is politically active.

00:47:45.525 --> 00:47:46.900
So if you care
about guns, that's

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.348
a place you can send money.

00:47:48.348 --> 00:47:49.390
They'll spend it for you.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.820
If you're old you, the
American Association of Retired

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.320
Persons--

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.243
I mean, there are
plenty of pockets.

00:47:57.243 --> 00:47:59.160
AUDIENCE: The things
that I care a lot about I

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.930
can give more money
to than other things.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.770
So that works--

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:05.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:05.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Sort of.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.068
AUDIENCE: --money
But then my voice

00:48:07.068 --> 00:48:09.383
is smaller because I
have less money in total.

00:48:09.383 --> 00:48:11.550
So someone who maybe doesn't
care as much about this

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.920
can give a little money, too,
but still larger than my voice.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.780
So money seems like the most
efficient system that I can

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.020
think of that allows people to
contribute to things they care

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.420
about a lot, and have
their voices heard there,

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.370
whereas things they
don't care about,

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.825
but they're part
of, they don't--

00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:29.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The issue that disturbs

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:31.925
people is sort of twofold.

00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:33.300
One of the things
that's happened

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.140
in this country over
the last 30 years,

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.090
maybe goes back
a little farther,

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.530
is increasing inequality
of income and wealth.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:48.120
I think it's very hard to
point a policy finger at what's

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.190
done that, and it's
very complicated

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.350
to figure out what's
done it, but it has

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.580
happened one way or another.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.760
And so the thing
that upsets people

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:02.450
is the difference in the
size of Warren Buffett's

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:04.910
voice and your voice.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.340
If it's one person,
one vote, we don't all

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.750
have equal impact on the
process with contributions.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:17.780
In fact, they differ by several
multiple orders of magnitude.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:18.830
That's the upset.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:22.310
I have no problem with-- and
the campaign finance laws

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.410
were supposed to deal with that.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:26.600
The idea was A,
corporations can't

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.830
make political
contributions, and B,

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.530
there's a limit on how much
an individual can spend.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.110
That was intended
to equalize voice.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.330
You can still give to
various organizations

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:43.220
as much as you want, but in
terms of the electoral process,

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.850
there were limits.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.120
Those laws are no
longer relevant because

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.568
of Citizens United.

00:49:49.568 --> 00:49:50.610
I mean, that's the issue.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:54.720
I mean, I've got no problem
with people spending money.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.000
I'm not profoundly upset
at the current system,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.500
but the huge difference
in the ability of somebody

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.620
like this casino owner
who gave $15 million

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.950
to the Newt Gingrich campaign--

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:14.830
that's one guy carrying
a presidential campaign.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:15.330
Wow.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:23.370
That no longer sounds
like Athenian democracy.

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:24.334
Yeah.

00:50:24.334 --> 00:50:26.890
AUDIENCE: Two points-- one,
couldn't a voucher system

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.260
solve this problem?

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.208
Like something proposed
by Lawrence Lessig.

00:50:31.208 --> 00:50:33.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Say what
you mean by a "voucher system."

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.333
AUDIENCE: So what
Lawrence Lessig says

00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:39.390
is that each individual
has $50 tax credit,

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:41.850
and that money goes towards
funding a candidate.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.430
And there's no other outside--

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.390
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah, it's
the "no other outside money"

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.810
that violates the
Constitution, almost certainly.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:52.253
So let me move
forward a little bit.

00:50:52.253 --> 00:50:53.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
second part.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:54.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, please.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:55.947
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
pure capitalism

00:50:55.947 --> 00:50:58.560
solve this problem
because the governments

00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.737
aren't involved then.

00:50:59.737 --> 00:51:02.070
And if you're buying milk,
it's the consumer [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.330
supply.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.913
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, you're saying

00:51:04.913 --> 00:51:07.300
that you should limit
the scope of government

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.120
so you can limit the
mischief it can do.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.357
AUDIENCE: In theory.

00:51:11.357 --> 00:51:12.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Sure.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.780
Why are we trying to
raise the price of milk,

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.920
for heaven's sakes?

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.570
Because dairy farmers
are a very effective

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.820
organized group and have been.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.278
Why do we raise
the price of sugar?

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:25.790
Because if we didn't have
barriers to trade in sugar,

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.920
we would undoubtedly
buy Cuban sugar,

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.200
and we don't wish
to buy Cuban sugar.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.670
Oh, and by the way,
they're sugar producers.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:40.640
Anyway, lobbying-- let me
urge you read the short piece

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.710
by [? Kline ?] and
[? Steller. ?] It's not

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.560
on the syllabus because
it came out this spring.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.980
It's a very nice description
consistent with all

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:54.130
my experience of
how lobbying works.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.770
Effective lobbyists don't
walk in with bags of money

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:57.940
to buy votes.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:01.360
Effective lobbyists
make friends.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.210
They get in to talk.

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.300
They provide information.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.140
The information is, of course,
slanted, but it's your friend.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.060
It's a very
interesting description

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.820
of what the guy calls
a "gift economy," where

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.790
basically you're doing favors.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.800
You have a complicated
piece of legislation.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.730
I'll discuss it with you when
we play golf next Saturday.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:25.960
We're good friends.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.707
How did I get hired
as a lobbyist?

00:52:27.707 --> 00:52:29.290
Because I'm friends
with these people.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:30.880
That's how I got
hired as a lobbyist,

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.990
so they'll play golf with me,
so I can tell them this stuff.

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.390
Yeah, maybe I give
them some tickets,

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.700
but I'm not going to buy
their votes with money

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.210
for a whole set of reasons.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.200
First of all, you go to jail
for that if you're caught.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.830
And second of all,
most people in Congress

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:50.320
don't think of
themselves as crooks.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.310
They think of themselves as
trying to do the right thing.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:59.260
So the process of lobbying
is very, very nicely

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.300
described in that article.

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.860
And again, it's
because I've seen it,

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.610
it's consistent with
everything I've seen.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.170
You become an effective lobby
not because you have more money

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.600
to swing around, but
because you can hire

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.520
people who have connections.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.560
You can get information
prepared that's useful,

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.040
and you have the ability to
affect campaign contributions.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.360
That does matter.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.130
But it's a very
different process.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:31.780
It's a process of influence,
not a process of bribery.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.950
So I urge you to read that.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.060
It's short.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:41.230
So quickly, [? Loewy ?] makes
the point interest group

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.320
competition is one
kind of politics.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.260
It really is inside baseball.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:52.540
But if you look at various
kinds of political action

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.210
and various kinds of
governmental action,

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:56.750
it doesn't all fit.

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:59.180
This is a set of possibilities.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.690
This is impact on
the Federal Reserve.

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.000
Well, is that interest groups?

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.110
Antitrust policy-- is
that interest groups?

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.500
Reapportionment-- well,
that's more complicated.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:17.830
Tariffs-- tariff policy
is winners and losers.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:23.320
Milk price supports is
aiding constituents.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.520
Regulation-- can you
make products safety

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.840
regulation interest groups?

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.560
Not too easily.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.320
So the [? Loewy ?]
point, and you

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.080
can read the text around this
to interpret this diagram,

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:40.600
is that that doesn't always
describe politics well.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.660
I'm going to come back to that
when we talk about regulation.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.340
There's also other models.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.310
Now, this is the piece by Whitt.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:53.470
And Whitt is a Marxist, so Whitt
is very big on class dialectic.

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:56.270
And if you can make sense out
of that, you're one up on me.

00:54:56.270 --> 00:55:01.210
But I think the middle column,
the split between the two

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.590
columns is interesting.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.200
If you think about
politics in China

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.450
or if you think about
traditional politics

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:09.160
in Latin American
countries, where

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.260
they would talk
about the oligarchy,

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:15.850
you would think about
this middle column.

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:20.330
You would think about
politics by the elite.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:26.870
Read descriptions of
politics in Haiti, et cetera.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.630
There are a number of situations
in which it makes sense

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:31.250
to think about.

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:35.810
And if you read
older descriptions

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.680
in Boston of the
vault, which is what

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.840
all the business
and civic leaders

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.770
would get together in the
vault of the Bank of Boston,

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:50.523
you sort of have a politics that
doesn't look so much like this.

00:55:50.523 --> 00:55:52.190
This is really a
[? Loewy ?] description

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:54.950
over here, a very nice
[? Loewy ?] description

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.870
of how it ought to work.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:01.590
But in fact, there are
situations in which in essence,

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:03.500
there is a relatively
small elite that

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.700
controls the government.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.250
They may control the
government for exploitation.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.750
They may control the
government for who knows what,

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:11.070
but it's a club.

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.580
It's a small club.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.920
And there are situations
that look like that.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.400
The US doesn't look like that
so much because our politics are

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.810
less well organized.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.300
Latin countries always
used to look like that.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.280
They're less so now.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.400
But again, listen to
[? Evita ?] and hear

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.610
them talk about the oligarchy.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.050
So there are a
number of settings

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.660
in which it makes sense to
think about the politics

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:43.130
as elite control, not
interest group competition.

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:45.350
You might think about that.

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:49.670
There are also situations
that don't fit any of these,

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.630
and I'll talk about
some of those.

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:57.170
What I want to do
now is begin the lead

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:04.070
into the discussion of
clean air as an example

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.010
where a number of these and
some other things surface.

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.090
So I realize that
to do that case,

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:11.780
you have to have a little
background on the structure

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.460
of federal regulation.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.660
And let me do that now.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.930
Please try to stay awake.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:26.450
The way the US system works,
typically, is laws are vague.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:29.480
Laws say things like,
"EPA must set a standard

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:34.700
to protect human health," or
"the public utility commission

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.580
shall ensure that electricity
prices are just, reasonable,

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.670
and not unduly discriminatory."

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:44.870
Very commonly, this is a
very standard-- sometimes

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:47.043
that's handed to a
cabinet department--

00:57:47.043 --> 00:57:49.460
the Department of Agriculture,
the Department of Interior,

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.030
whatever.

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:51.860
Sometimes, it's
handed to an agency.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.000
We're talking here
mostly about agencies.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.228
They come in two forms--

00:57:59.228 --> 00:58:00.770
they're either
independent or they're

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:03.033
part of the executive branch.

00:58:03.033 --> 00:58:04.700
If they're part of
the executive branch,

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.310
like EPA, the President
appoints the head.

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:09.950
The President can fire the head.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:12.650
If they're independent,
the President

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:15.800
will be able to appoint the
head but not remove them,

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.200
except to show cause.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.840
You can fire the head of EPA
because he or she ticked you

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.040
off.

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.130
To fire the head of FERC,
you have to show cause.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.450
That can be challenged
in court, and so forth.

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:29.900
So they are independent.

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.920
They were invented around in
the teens of the last century.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.810
The idea was to
make them-- well,

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:37.400
there were some
earlier examples,

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.280
but it was really pushed then.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.870
The idea was these
will be expert

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.340
bodies immune to politics.

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.520
The Federal Trade Commission
is one such like that it.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.980
It has its own building.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.080
It gets its money from Congress.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.720
It doesn't report
to the President.

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.480
The President appoints people
with the consent of Congress,

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.130
can't fire them.

00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:00.890
Often, they have
to be bipartisan--

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:03.500
two Republicans, two
Democrats, something like that.

00:59:06.037 --> 00:59:06.995
They could be captured.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.740
They could be captured by
the regulated interests.

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.870
It's argued that FERC is
captured by the utilities.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.760
I don't think that's true,
but you can make the case.

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.030
And the idea of
putting EPA, which

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.010
is a later creation,
in the executive branch

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.430
was to make it responsive to
politics, make it responsible.

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.270
It affects the
kind of oversight.

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:39.410
Rules passed by EPA,
rules proposed by EPA,

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:43.190
are reviewed by the Office
of Information and Regulatory

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.100
Analysis in the Office
of Management and Budget.

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.170
They can be called
in on the carpet.

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.000
They can be fired.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.530
All kinds of things
could happen.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.200
The Federal Communications
Commission, or the FERC,

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.910
or state public
utility commissions,

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.378
are not reviewed in that
fashion by the President,

00:59:59.378 --> 01:00:01.170
or the President's
people, or the governor,

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.060
or the governor's people.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:08.220
But all decisions by
regulatory agencies

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.100
can be reviewed in the courts.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.260
So here's the architecture.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.080
The law says it's got to
be just and reasonable.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.340
It's got to protect,
blah, blah, blah.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.980
In some cases, the
President or the governor

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.620
can review it,
more commonly not.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.640
It gets reviewed by the courts
under the Administrative

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.170
Procedures Act of 1946,
or related state acts.

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:38.760
The court can reject
an action that's

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.040
arbitrary and capricious,
an abuse of discretion,

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.420
or not otherwise in
accordance with the law.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.070
So the law says you have
to protect human health.

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:50.040
The agency has no
evidence on health.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.620
The court will say, that's
arbitrary and capricious,

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.390
and throw it out.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:59.770
Or you didn't take into
account public comment.

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:04.080
So here is where organized
interest groups matter.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.180
So the agency is going
to make a decision.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.445
It has to take
comments, usually.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:17.300
And the American Public
Power Association

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.210
will file comments
on everything. e

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.685
which is this
electricity consumers

01:01:21.685 --> 01:01:23.810
organization, will file
comments on everything that

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:25.310
has to do with electricity.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:27.810
You and I won't.

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:32.050
As will every utility in
the land, and who knows,

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:33.300
General Electric.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.390
Organized interest groups
will file comments.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.480
And the courts
will reject a rule

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.450
that doesn't take adequate
account of public comment.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:49.500
So if somebody proves that a
chemical is cancer causing,

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:54.180
and EPA says, no,
it'll be thrown out.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.330
You've got to consider
the evidence that's

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.060
submitted in the process.

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.580
That's the regulatory process,
particularly as it relates

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.050
to environmental regulation--

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:10.520
fairly vague laws, not
always, not on all terms,

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.040
but usually fairly
vague, hands it off,

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.290
delegates to the agency.

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:20.300
Sometimes, in the case of EPA,
reviewed by the White House,

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.290
sometimes not.

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:25.570
Always reviewable by
the courts, always

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.640
a requirement to take
into account comments.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.410
You might ask, who would
work in a regulatory agency?

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:37.480
And we'll talk
about that briefly.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.460
But is that process
reasonably straightforward?

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.106
Yeah.

01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:44.255
AUDIENCE: Would it
take into account

01:02:44.255 --> 01:02:45.338
who's making the comments?

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.780
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No.

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:54.030
You take into account
the evidence provided.

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:57.470
So if the large
electricity consumers, say,

01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:00.200
we think that rates
too high, well, there's

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.210
nothing to take into account.

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:09.110
If they say, here's a study that
shows that 10% of our members

01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:12.050
will be driven bankrupt
by these prices,

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:18.540
and the study is not junk,
they have to consider that.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.340
So they're not obliged, in
fact, they're almost obliged

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.580
not to take into
account the source,

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.810
but to focus on the content,
which is sort of sensible.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:30.890
Yeah.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.850
Anything else?

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:37.850
Yeah, you actually
have to make arguments.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:42.892
OK, so we've been talking
about interest group politics.

01:03:42.892 --> 01:03:44.100
We're talking about factions.

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:51.760
How did that act get passed?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.477
Was that interest
group competition?

01:03:54.477 --> 01:03:56.060
Did interest group
competition give us

01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:00.620
the Clean Air Act of 1970?

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.970
And if so list the groups.

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:08.200
Clean Air Act of 1970
was a strong assertion

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.250
of federal power
over the environment.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:13.510
It in effect-- didn't quite,
but in effect-- created EPA.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:20.280
Put in the architecture for
air pollution control, water

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.240
pollution control--

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.890
well, the air
pollution control--

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:25.140
that still governs.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.720
Took power from the states.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.393
Interest group competition?

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.936
Brendan.

01:04:34.936 --> 01:04:36.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
competition

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:40.990
between environmentalists
and those maybe people who

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.615
were using chemicals
that the Clean Air

01:04:42.615 --> 01:04:46.000
Act was [INAUDIBLE] against?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.969
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, environmentalists--

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.020
let me push you
a little farther.

01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:01.150
If you go back to 1960, could
you find environmentalists?

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.902
AUDIENCE: No.

01:05:01.902 --> 01:05:03.360
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
What happened?

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.730
I think it was 1970
or close to 1970.

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.700
There was a big event.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:09.942
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Earth Day.

01:05:09.942 --> 01:05:10.570
Earth Day.

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.190
That was when people
started talking

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:14.650
not about environmentalists,
but about the environmental

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:16.370
movement.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:19.210
You began to hear
the word "movement,"

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:23.170
just as you start to
hear about the Tea Party

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:26.680
movement, the Occupy Movement.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.410
You started to hear about
the environmental movement,

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:32.530
the civil rights movement.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.880
Those aren't really
interest groups.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.870
We'll talk Monday
about what they are,

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.320
but social movements
are a bit distinct

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.670
from organized interest groups.

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.660
They're certainly distinct from
organized political parties.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.440
Yet every so often, they get
something like that passed.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.330
Richard Nixon was not an
avid environmentalist.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:57.360
This was not a Republican
issue, to say the least.

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:03.670
There was no industrial
support for the cleanup, maybe

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.830
a little industrial
support, because the state

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.780
rules differed and that
was a little problematic,

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:13.810
but not much, not noticeable
industrial support.

01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:16.750
That was a social movement.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.400
Who was it was
telling me about all

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.090
the "No fracking" signs
in New York State,

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:23.720
somebody who sits over here?

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.780
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
that's a social movement.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.090
That's not an organized
interest group

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:34.780
in the sense that the American
Forest Products Association is

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.390
or the American Public
Power Association.

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.060
That's a bunch of people who
get very upset about fracking,

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.520
and who by god make noise.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.320
That's what got us
the Clean Air Act.

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:49.900
We may need that to do
something about climate change,

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.108
but we don't have a social
movement in that direction

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:54.220
quite yet.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:58.080
But we did have interest
groups after '71.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.400
So who were they?

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.700
Who were the interest groups
affecting SO2 regulation

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.095
from power plants?

01:07:06.095 --> 01:07:08.220
And we're going to walk
through the case next week.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.730
So please, please do get it.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:12.680
Anybody?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.100
Has somebody looked at the case?

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:14.933
Who were the groups?

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:19.175
Sarah.

01:07:19.175 --> 01:07:21.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
coal power plants

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.575
who [INAUDIBLE] their facilities
and where they get their coal.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:28.200
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you had
utilities with coal-fired power

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.550
plants.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.740
Who else?

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.820
AUDIENCE: You had utilities
as well, utilities.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Utilities,
yeah, with coal-fired power.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:37.987
They owned them.

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.290
Everybody was vertically
integrated in those days.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.245
Utilities with coal-fired
power plants and--

01:07:42.245 --> 01:07:43.620
AUDIENCE:
Environmental concerns.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.495
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Environmentalists, yeah.

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:47.186
They were pretty well
organized by then.

01:07:47.186 --> 01:07:48.900
AUDIENCE: Coal producers in
the East and in the West.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.858
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Coal
producers in the East

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.415
and in the West,
two distinct groups.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.030
Eastern and Western
producers, electric utilities,

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.580
Western states a
little bit on some

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.300
of the prevention of
significant deterioration,

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:15.040
and the environmentalists--

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.420
who wasn't represented?

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.560
Anybody?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.979
To go back to [? Loewy, ?]
are there any interests, not

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:22.670
interest groups.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.755
Are there any interests, David?

01:08:24.755 --> 01:08:26.880
AUDIENCE: We all buy the
electric power [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.149
price [INAUDIBLE]
affects us [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:30.770
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So consumers

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:33.080
weren't represented,
except maybe indirectly

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.439
by electric utilities who
wanted to keep their costs down.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:42.090
So you're not represented as
a consumer of electric power.

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:43.384
Any other interest, Charlotte?

01:08:43.384 --> 01:08:45.884
AUDIENCE: Maybe the people who
are near the power plants who

01:08:45.884 --> 01:08:47.359
would be affected by pollution.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.790
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: People
who breathe air, right.

01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:51.380
Yeah.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.810
So the environmental
groups, in a sense,

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:58.160
are indirectly
representing that interest.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.020
As we'll see, they also
had other interests.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.310
So I don't know,
I think those are

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:06.770
the main ones that I think of.

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:08.040
You had more.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.200
Oh, I thought you were--

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.170
just waving, OK.

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:16.609
OK, how did the act set it up?

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:17.300
Who did what?

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.350
What did EPA have to do?

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:19.910
What did the states do?

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:20.960
What about new plants?

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.220
What about old plants?

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.990
What was the design?

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:28.040
Who did what, the
'70 act set up.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:28.892
Casey.

01:09:28.892 --> 01:09:32.149
AUDIENCE: The EPA set
overarching air pollution

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:33.745
limits, and then
each state would

01:09:33.745 --> 01:09:35.800
have to figure out how they
were going to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.850
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So the EPA would

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:39.460
set air quality standard,
national ambient air quality

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.300
standards.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.960
And then it would, as regards
existing plants and existing

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.090
facilities, ask the states
for state implementation plans

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:51.069
to meet those requirements.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.090
Absolutely right.

01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:53.735
What about new power plants?

01:09:53.735 --> 01:09:56.152
AUDIENCE: There's a different
set of regulations for them.

01:09:56.152 --> 01:09:57.457
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:57.457 --> 01:09:58.665
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Set by--

01:09:58.665 --> 01:10:00.468
AUDIENCE: Set by the EPA.

01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:02.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Set by the EPA--

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:06.660
so the EPA didn't set standards
or rules for existing plants.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.120
It set air quality standards.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.310
Let the states figure
out how to do that.

01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:15.870
But for new plants, there
were national standards

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:16.545
for new plants.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.670
What's the basic rationale?

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:24.010
Why would you treat new and
old plants so differently?

01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:25.480
Matthew.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.860
AUDIENCE: Because
the existing plants,

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.730
in order to retrofit them, you
would need expensive equipment.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.117
It might not even be worth it.

01:10:33.117 --> 01:10:37.080
But the new ones, they can
design it so that [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So that's
the basic rationale exactly--

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.630
that new plants,
in a sense, you've

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.290
got a blank sheet of paper.

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:48.490
And you can design the
plant to meet this standard.

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.010
Old plants differ
in so many ways

01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:55.090
that there's no easy way
to use the same standard

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.290
across all old plants.

01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:58.690
It would be easy for some,
impossible for others.

01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:01.150
Let the states figure it out.

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:04.930
That is exactly the
basic rationale.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.770
We'll come back to sort
of how that worked.

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:12.310
So what we're going to do
in the next two sessions,

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:17.490
we're going to talk about
social movements on Monday.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:20.160
And one of the reasons we're
talking about social movements

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:27.300
is that that's what got
the '70s act passed.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.320
The Civil Rights movement
got civil rights legislation

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.040
passed--

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.310
not an organized party, not
quite an interest group,

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:38.220
not the American Forest
Products Association.

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.230
And then we'll come
back to this case,

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:46.620
and we'll talk about how we got
the politics of the standards,

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.740
the two sets of standards, the
acid rain impasse, emissions

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.010
trading, other stuff.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.860
Thank you.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.590
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.730
In this section, we're
going to build on--

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.940
we just learned about
the relativistic Doppler

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.190
effect and redshift.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.220
So we take on traveling
through the galaxy

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.370
from here, from Earth, towards
the center of the galaxy.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.850
The situation is as follows.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.240
We have Bob, who's
stationary on our planet,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.710
Earth, and Alice, who makes
use of a new spacecraft.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.780
This spacecraft
is able to travel

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.460
with a velocity of 0.99999998
times the speed of light.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.710
So that's really fast.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.250
It corresponds to a
gamma factor of 15,000.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
Now, the center of the galaxy is
about 30,000 light years away.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.030
And in Bob's reference
frame, this journey

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.390
will take about 30,000
years, because velocity

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.983
is about the speed of light.

00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:05.010
For Alice, however, the journey
will only take two years.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.570
So it's quite doable.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.880
The question, now, is
what does Alice see?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.920
Literally, what is
she going to see

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.400
while she is looking out of
the windows of the spacecraft?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.740
Is the picture
similar to the one

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.320
we see in some of the
movies, where on the horizon,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.620
there's lots of stars, and once
the spacecraft accelerates,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.630
you see those dots
kind of blurry, coming

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.300
towards us, right?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.860
Or is the situation
somehow different?

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.050
The starlight has a wavelength
of about 600 nanometers,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.110
and the cosmic microwave
background a wavelength

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.870
of 1.06 millimeters.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.210
So how is Alice going
to observe those two

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.480
light sources in her travel?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.100
So I invite you
to work this out,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.140
but also think about
the next question.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.370
How long does it take for
Alice to accelerate from 0

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.370
to her velocity with
an acceleration of 10

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.050
meters per second
squared, which is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.630
1g, which is very, very doable?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.130
OK.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.410
So I invite you to
stop the video here

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.270
and work out those
numbers to get a feel

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.480
and speculate a little bit about
how this journey is actually

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.650
going to look like.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.750
So here's the solution.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.470
So the light's
moving towards us,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.900
so it's going to be blueshifted.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.360
The velocity is given here.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.690
And with beta, we have seen
that redshift or 1 plus

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.930
redshift is equal to the
emitted wavelength divided

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.550
by the observed wavelength.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.360
And you find that
that factor is 10,000.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.430
So we just have to divide our
emitted wavelength by 10,000

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.450
and find that the
observed starlight has

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.630
a wavelength of 0.06
nanometers, which is X-ray.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.090
So she's going to be
flooded by X-rays of light

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.070
coming from the stars.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.280
And similarly, the observed
cosmic microwave background

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.460
is going to be about
106 nanometers, which

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.640
is ultraviolet light.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.970
The ultraviolet light--
there's a spectrum to this.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.860
So what she's going to see is
X-rays, which she can actually

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.240
not see with her eyes.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.970
But she will be able to see
the ultraviolet, or some part

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.390
of the spectrum, as kind
of a blurry, fuzzy kind

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.410
of background all
over the place.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.380
So the situation is actually
different from what we just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.510
saw in this picture.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.530
A few more fun facts about the
cosmic microwave background.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.180
It's actually at a temperature.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.140
So the spectrum of cosmic
microwave background, those

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.200
photons, they correspond
to a spectrum emitted

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.820
by [INAUDIBLE] which corresponds
to a specific temperature

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.920
of 2.7 kelvin.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.540
That is the temperature
of our universe.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.130
This temperature was about
3,000 kelvin about 380,000 years

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.520
after the Big Bang, the age
of the universe at the time.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.720
And so then at that time, this
corresponds to visible light.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.000
But at that moment, the light
stopped interacting-- well,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.250
stopped--

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.120
The likelihood for the light
to interact with something

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.880
out there in the
universe became so low

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.980
that it just
stopped interacting.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.430
And then the frequency
changed, because the universe

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.900
was expanding.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.760
So what we are
seeing today is kind

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.430
of a relic of the universe
at that time, at 380,000

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.070
years after the Big Bang.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.770
And if you study the
cosmic microwave background

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.360
with some more
precision, you see

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.860
that there are
actually fluctuations

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.750
which can be analyzed.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.365
It turns out that you can
correlate those fluctuations--

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:49.850
the fluctuations of the
energy density 380,000 years

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.290
after the Big Bang--

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.340
to this, the present of
today's stars and galaxies

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.240
and galaxy clusters.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.730
So those energy
fluctuations, they

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.660
served as seeds for the
formation of galaxies

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.340
and galaxy clusters.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.290
Quite interesting.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.440
Today, we have about
400 of those photons--

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.905
microwave photons-- per
square cubic centimeter.

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:16.040
So there's quite a busy
environment around here.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.110
So like, this little cube has
about 400 of those photons.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.800
Now, this is a spectrum as well.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.880
It's not just a
monochromatic background,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.590
but it's a spectrum
which corresponds

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.490
to these temperature
[INAUDIBLE] All right.

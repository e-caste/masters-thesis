00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.910
PROFESSOR: Another strange
observation about mirrors that

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.310
I've never really understood--

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.520
the mirror plane is reflecting
me left to right, so it looks

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.680
as though a mirror has
a grain to it.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.850
It knows what line to reflect
me back and forth.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.420
But if I kept the mirror in
fixed orientation and I lay

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.900
down, the thing should
reflect me side to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.400
side, but it doesn't.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.380
It still reflects me
from top to bottom.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.080
So how can that be?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.050
Why does a mirror plane, if I
hold it in one orientation,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.290
appear to have a direction
across which I'm reflected but

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.920
it doesn't follow
me if I move?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.140
Know what I mean?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.862
You have any explanation
of that?

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:02.344
Hmm?

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:04.272
AUDIENCE: Rotate
your eyes, too.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.990
PROFESSOR: Rotate my eyes.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.280
I can roll them around.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.775
I can't rotate in any
other fashion.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.340
That's strange.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.760
I mean, you look at yourself
every morning--

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.200
several times, perhaps,
and you're reflected

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.820
always left to right.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.490
And if you turn the
mirror, it doesn't

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.080
reflect you top to bottom.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.740
Or conversely, you can leave the
mirror alone and you can--

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.635
why does a mirror plane just
reflect you left to right?

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:37.450
Ah.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.390
I'll let you stew about
that one for a while.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.720
And I can tell you that I know
of three papers in scientific

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.290
journals that tried
to explain this.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.125
I can give you literature
citations, but you think about

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:58.080
it until our next meeting.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.310
Why does it know which
way I'm oriented?

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.320
Ah, I can't think about it.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.090
Alright, back to more
straightforward questions.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.360
We are now about to embark on
a grand process of synthesis

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.240
which will take us the better
part of half a semester.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.690
And we've identified our
four basic operations--

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.000
four basic one step
operations--

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:41.760
namely translation, reflection,
rotation, and for

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.750
the time being I'm going to look
just at two-dimensional

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.240
symmetries, so I'll leave
inversion out of the picture.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.990
It's only defined in three
dimensions, and the logic

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.970
which I will follow will be to
first build up two-dimensional

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.840
symmetries and then we'll turn
them into three-dimensional

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.900
symmetries by picking another
translation that's not

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.080
coplanar with the first two.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.110
So we're going to look for
the time being at just

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.910
two-dimensional symmetries.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.810
The nice thing about doing this
is that the number of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.680
two-dimensional symmetries is
relatively small, so we can

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.470
derive them rigorously
and exhaustively.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.720
To do so in three dimensions is
a much more time consuming

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.400
and elaborate exercise.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.880
It's no different in principle,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.380
there's just more work.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.710
So if we do two-dimensional
symmetries first,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.690
it's an easy case.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.370
We can do it rigorously and
completely, and then what

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.140
we'll do is just look at a few
examples in three dimensions

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.050
and look at how the results are
designated and tabulated.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.410
So the first combination I will
choose to make is one

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.600
that I set up last time and
should not have started when

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.100
there was no time
to finish it.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.370
So let me take an initially
pristine space and say that to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.640
this I'm going to the operation
of translation.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.120
That immediately implies a
string of translations and a

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.740
string of lattice points, but
I'm just going to focus my

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.370
attention on the first one.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.220
Then what I said I'll do is add
to the space a rotation

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.100
operation A alpha.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.010
I'm going to for convenience
put it right at the lattice

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.420
point, but as there is no
unique origin to the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.350
translation, I can start
and stop the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.520
translation anywhere I like.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.520
So here's my translation.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.030
The rotation operation is going
to take that translation

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.720
and repeat it at angular
intervals alpha so that I get

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.540
a radiating porcupine-like
sheaf of translations all

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.280
coming out of a common point.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.790
Alpha, we observed, has to be
a submultiple of 2 pi, so I

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.390
will have a cluster of
translations separated by the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.220
equal interval alpha--

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.310
angular interval alpha--

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.560
and I'm going to choose to
focus my attention on

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.340
just the first one.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.470
So this, since it's repeated
by rotation, has the same

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.180
length T.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.380
And then I'm going to look
at the other end of the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.840
translation and say that
similarly I must have a set of

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.200
equally spaced angular-wise
translations all separated by

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.290
alpha, and I'm going to choose
to focus my attention

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.830
just on this one.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.670
So this angle is alpha, and
this angle here is alpha.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.450
And now there's big trouble
in River City.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.800
This is a translation, here's
a lattice point, here's a

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.460
lattice point.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.710
This is a translation--

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.550
a lattice point sits up here.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.210
This is a translation--

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.800
a lattice points sits up here.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.370
Now I've got two lattice points
eyeball to eyeball, and

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.100
they jolly well better be
separated by either the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.780
interval T or some multiple
P times T,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.726
where P is some integer.

00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:08.910
It would be quite all right if
there were two translation

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.220
separation or five translation
separation, but it must be

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.020
some multiple of translation or
I have violated my initial

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.790
premise that everything in this
space is periodic at a

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.460
translational interval T.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.300
So let me take this geometrical
constraint and

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.770
very quickly convert it into
analytical form so that we can

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.300
proceed to systematically
find out what the

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.300
possibilities are.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.780
Let me drop a perpendicular
down to the original

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.160
translation.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.220
So this distance in here is PT,
this distance will be T

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:57.480
times the cosine of alpha, and
this distance in here will be

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.700
T times the cosine of alpha.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.580
So in analytic form, then, I
can say that my original

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.020
translation T is equal
to T cosine of alpha

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.590
plus T cosine of alpha.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.270
That's 2T cosine of
alpha plus PT.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:26.130
And the first thing we can see
is that the magnitude of T

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.090
drops out because this
construction and the

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.580
constraint it embodies in no way
depends on the magnitude

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.790
of the translation.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.870
So this says, then, that 1 is
equal to 2 cosine of alpha

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:54.220
plus the integer P. And if I
solve for the value of cosine

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.900
of alpha, cosine of alpha will
be 1 minus an integer P

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.300
divided by 2.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.460
So there is the constraint that
must be followed if my

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.940
construction is to be
self-consistent.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.640
So we've got this now in a
plug and chug situation.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.850
So what I'm going to put down is
the value of P, taking all

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.310
possible integers for
which a value of

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.910
cosine of alpha exists.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.380
I'm then going to evaluate
cosine of alpha, which is 1

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:34.210
minus P over 2, and then I'm
going to identify the n-fold

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.640
axis that corresponds to that
particular value of alpha.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.640
Let's put in P equals 3,
and this is as far

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.170
as we got last time.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.380
Well, if we put 4, then cosine
of alpha is minus 3/2--

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.970
it's not defined.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:00.650
If we drop P down to 3, then
cosine of alpha is minus 1, 1

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.020
minus 3 over 2.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.405
And the angle whose cosine
is minus 1 is a--

00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:10.370
let me put down the
value of alpha and

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.700
then the n-fold axis.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.080
The angle whose cosine is minus
1 is 180 degrees, and

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.050
that would describe quite nicely
the rotational throw of

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.680
a twofold axis.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:34.130
If I let P drop down to the
value 2, then I have minus 1/2

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.130
of the cosine of alpha.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:42.530
The angle whose cosine is minus
1/2 is 120 degrees.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.150
And guess what?

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.350
That's the angular throw
of a threefold axis.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.720
Let P drop down to 1, and then
cosine of alpha is 0.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.270
The angle whose cosine is 0 is
90 degrees, and that would be

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.520
a fourfold axis.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:10.570
Looks like we're done, except
P could be equal to 0.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:16.920
In that case, cosine of
alpha is plus 1/2.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:25.740
The angle whose cosine is plus
1/2 is equal to 60 degrees,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.460
and that's a sixfold access.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.850
What about negative integers?

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.290
Minus one, will that work?

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.710
This says that cosine of alpha
is 1, and the angle whose

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.960
cosine is one is 0 degrees
or 360 degrees.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.460
And that would be no rotational
symmetry all.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.070
It's rather amusing that the
trivial case of no symmetry at

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.080
all also falls out of
this construction.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.040
So this is a momentous result.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.010
We've shown that if you're going
to have a pattern that

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.900
has a repetition by translation
in it, the number

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.450
of rotational symmetries that
can be added are either no

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.850
symmetry at all, a twofold
rotational symmetry,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.340
threefold, fourfold,
or sixfold.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.580
In other words, the axis--

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.810
no symmetry at all, twofold,
threefold, fourfold, or

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.700
sixfold, nothing else.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.380
This tells you a lot about the
shapes that you can see

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.330
macroscopically on crystals.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.920
You could have a crystal that
had the shape of the trigonal

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.820
prism, and that would
be perfectly fine.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.550
You could have a crystal that
had the shape of an orthogonal

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.040
brick that would have twofold
axes coming out of the faces.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.610
You could have a crystal in
the shape of a hexagonal

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.880
present, or you could have a
crystal in the shape of the

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.450
square prism.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.780
But something thing like a
crystal with a pentagonal

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.720
cross section that would
be a fivefold access--

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.900
that is strictly forbidden,
because the external shape of

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.860
the crystal has to reflect the
internal symmetry among the

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.110
arrangement of atoms.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.750
There are lots of things
in nature that have

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.900
crystallographic symmetry.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:56.955
There is a little cactus that
looks like this with some

00:12:56.955 --> 00:13:00.470
little spines coming out like
this on the top, and its

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.650
proper name is astrophytum
myriostigma, also known as the

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.980
ornamented bishops cap.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.970
Beautiful example of fivefold
symmetry, but the cells inside

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.290
of that cactus can not have the
same size and shape and be

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.050
repeated by translation.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:27.010
There are flowers that have
very common examples of

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:31.490
fivefold and even sevenfold
symmetry.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.850
There's one little purple flower
that looks like this

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:38.370
that comes out in the spring,
and that's called periwinkle.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.760
Fivefold symmetry-- fine for a
plant, but if you got down

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.370
inside the stem of this flower,
the cells cannot be

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.234
repeated by translation.

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:57.770
There are astronomically
high symmetries.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:05.250
These big giant cacti in the
Southwest, the saguaro, they

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.970
have rotational symmetries
that run from 18-fold,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.740
19-fold, 23-fold, so that if
you picked up one of these

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.030
guys very carefully, because
they're covered with spines,

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.400
and if you could lift it--
which would be very hard

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.460
because they weigh a
couple of tons--

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.680
take that guy and rotate them
through 1/27 of a circle, and

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.930
if he had 27-fold symmetry, you
could plop them down and

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.930
you couldn't tell that
it had been moved.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:39.060
There is no crystallographer
who can resist cacti.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.830
All sorts of symmetry, even
symmetries that violate

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.680
crystal graphic symmetries--

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.680
wonderful textures and colors.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.190
And they have another really
remarkable property, which

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.540
commends them as house plants.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:00.420
If they die, this sheath of
spines stays intact until

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.990
someday when you're watering it,
you brush against it and

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.230
you poke a hole right through
the spines and

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.160
there's nothing inside.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.500
So a house plant that dies and
you can't tell for two years

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:17.230
or so is a very good plant
to have as a companion.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:21.740
So cacti have all sorts
of strange symmetries.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.420
Fine, but you can say something
about the internal

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.876
structure of that flower
or that cactus.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:36.390
But this little almost trivial
proof has told us something

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.140
else about crystals, because
the presence of translation

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.520
imposes a constraint on the
rotational symmetry that can

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:52.730
be present, and the rotational
symmetry tells us something

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.930
about the nature of the
two-dimensional lattice which

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.650
can accommodate that symmetry.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.330
So let's go through this list
once more, and let's pay

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.790
attention to the value of P.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.160
For a twofold rotational
symmetry, what we would do

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.880
would be to take this original
translation, we put the

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.300
twofold axis here, and that
takes the translation and

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.610
rotates it around.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.540
So here's a lattice point here,
one here, one here, and

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.110
the twofold axis here, takes the
translation and we rotate

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.080
in a counterclockwise sense.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.360
Here's another lattice
point here.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:37.460
P was equal to three
translations, and I'll be

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.780
darned if that isn't exactly
what we have.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.005
Three translations from
this lattice point A--

00:16:44.005 --> 00:16:45.960
let me put some labels
up here.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.740
This was lattice point A, this
was lattice point B, and this

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.590
was our translation PT.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.170
Three translations, just
as advertised.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.530
What constraint does this
put on a lattice?

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.180
None whatsoever, because all
this says is that if you have

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.560
a translation that translation
must be repeated into an

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.369
extended one-dimensional row.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:21.089
So you can put this an any
2D lattice whatsoever.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:26.060
In other words, the magnitudes
of the two translations--

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.780
let's call them T1 and T2 are
under no constraint to be

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.480
related one to another--

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.200
and this angle between
them, alpha, can be

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.450
anything that it likes.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.280
You could have a twofold axis,
but that requires simply a

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.760
lattice row parallel to T1 and
a lattice row parallel to T2.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.020
The next integer we
hit was minus 1/2.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:04.500
That was cosine of minus 1/2,
this was P equals 3, and that

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.280
corresponded to something
that could

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.435
accept a threefold symmetry.

00:18:14.435 --> 00:18:17.410
So let me put a guide to the
I in here and make an

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.970
equilateral triangle.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:25.920
If we translate and rotate
up by 120 degrees using a

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.910
threefold axis and then rotate
minus 120 degrees about the

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.790
other lattice point, that
puts another translation

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.550
up here, and now--

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:48.720
I'm sorry, this was P equals 2
And as required, this is PT,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.295
and that's equal to
two translations.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.630
This has put a constraint on the
sort of lattice which can

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.490
exist in this space because we
have two translations, T1 and

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.650
T2, which are equal in
magnitude, identical in

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.780
magnitude, because they're
related by symmetry.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.760
And consequently, we have
defined a space lattice, a

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.670
two-dimensional space lattice.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.940
We'll call this T1
and call this T2.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.660
This lattice has the constraint
that magnitude of

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.060
T1 must be identical to the
magnitude of T2, and the angle

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:39.170
between T1 and T2 is again
identically 120 degrees.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:45.910
Not 119.9, but exactly 120
degrees because there is a

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.630
threefold axis in here that
demands that that be so.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.690
So this is a very specialized
kind of lattice, restricted to

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.533
have two translations identical
in magnitude.

00:19:57.533 --> 00:20:00.520
And if there's a threefold axis
there, you should be able

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.860
to find these two.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.680
And if there's a threefold axis
there, then the angle

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.145
between these two specialized
translations is 120 degrees.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.410
Our next magic integer was 1,
and that corresponded to a

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.660
fourfold axis.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.430
And if we do what we claimed we
did in that construction,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.600
we'd put a fold axis here.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.690
That takes T1 and rotates it
exactly 90 degrees to a

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.540
translation T2.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.500
Once again, two noncollinear
translations, so we have

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.665
defined a two-dimensional net.

00:20:53.665 --> 00:20:58.630
If we complete the cell, this
is one translation.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:05.670
PT is equal to one translation
in here, and this angle is 90

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.170
degrees because it's produced
by a fourfold axis.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.310
So we have a very
special lattice.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.680
Again, the magnitudes of two
translations are identical--

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.380
not approximately the same,
they're identical--

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.555
and the angle between them is
identically 90 degrees.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.540
Only a couple to go.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:40.480
P could be equal to 0, and that
was the case for a 60

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.630
degree rotation,
a sixfold axis.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.360
So again, let's draw what
came out of this

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.740
particular special case.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.810
Here's T1, here is T2.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.120
This angle is 60 degrees exactly
because there's a

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.660
six-fold rotation axis here, a
sixfold rotation axis here,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.220
and the rotation of 60 in the
opposite sense gives us

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.960
another translation here.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:14.210
These two lattice points
coincide and there is PT equal

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.905
to 0T, and these two
points coincide.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:26.490
Now if I complete a standard
unit cell with T1 T2 as I've

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.710
done in other cases--

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:36.200
this was T1, this was T2, this
was a translation which I'm

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.710
not going to use.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.320
So this is the shape of the
lattice and these now are

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.890
lattice points with a sixfold
axis on them.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.600
The dimensional specialization
is exactly the same as I found

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.240
for a threefold axis,
T1 identical to T2.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:01.130
If I pick this cell, T1 to T2
can be described as an angle

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.405
of 120 degrees.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.910
Exactly the same lattice that we
found for a threefold axis.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.690
So with this simple minded
little construction we've

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.410
found two profound things--

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.770
that there are five kinds of
rotation axes, including the

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.050
onefold no rotational
symmetry at all.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:40.540
And it turns out that there are
one, a general lattice, a

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.420
hexagonal lattice, and
the square lattice.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.380
There are three kinds of
two-dimensional lattices that

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.210
are required by these
symmetry elements.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:58.440
So these guys require that
there be three lattice of

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:04.170
different specializations that
are able to accommodate them.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:13.330
So let me call this a
parallelogram net, and that

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.910
has T1 not equal to
T2, the angle

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.620
between T1 and T2 general.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.380
And this is a lattice that can
accommodate either no symmetry

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:34.890
at all or a twofold
rotation access.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:43.980
Then there was a net that I'll
call the hexagonal net, and

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:50.140
this had T1 identical to T2 in
magnitude, and it had the

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.570
angle between them, the angle
between T1 and T2 as

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:59.080
identically 120 degrees.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.330
And this could accommodate
either a threefold or a

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.390
sixfold axis.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.920
And then finally, the general
net, which I call a

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:18.470
parallelogram net, and that
has magnitudes of the two

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.430
translations not equal
to one another.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.790
They can have any values they
like, and the angle between T1

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.590
and T2 is completely general.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.830
And that's exactly what I had
up here for the-- oh, we did

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.350
that once already.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.170
The one that I'm missing, the
third one, is the square net.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.450
Square net has T1
identical to T2.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:55.670
In magnitude, the angle between
them is exactly 90

00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:02.410
degrees, and that is required
by a fourfold axis.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.715
Let me pause here to see if
there are any questions.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.488
Yes, sir.

00:26:21.488 --> 00:26:24.890
AUDIENCE: When you write on the
last one with the sixfold,

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.348
it's only 120.

00:26:26.348 --> 00:26:28.778
You could have also written
60, correct?

00:26:28.778 --> 00:26:29.750
PROFESSOR: Yes, I could have.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:35.880
And this lattice is actually the
same as what I found for a

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.310
threefold axis.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:42.480
I could pick either this or this
as the cell, but the two

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.310
translations in those
two cells are equal.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:50.070
And again at various stages
along the way, we'll need a

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.880
convention.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.700
And if I have a net that looks
like this, a parallelogram,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.430
whether a specialized
parallelogram or not, I have a

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.520
choice of two angles
that I could use.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.770
We call that alpha.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:07.930
This is going to be 180
degrees minus alpha.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.170
Which do I pick?

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:21.040
You need a rule, and the rule is
that for labeling the cell,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.920
pick alpha so that it's greater

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.220
or equal to 90 degrees.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.230
That's pure convention, but you
want to have a rule just

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.810
like a language so people use
the same words to describe the

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.330
same thing.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.350
Here we want to use the same
geometry to describe one and

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.500
the same thing.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.380
The other convention is that
there are no unique

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.400
translations that
define a net.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.400
We could take linear
combinations of these vectors

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.800
and define the same lattice,
so we need another rule for

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.790
selecting the standard
translations--

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.140
again, so that two people can
do an x-ray diffraction

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.060
experiment and report the
results in terms of the same

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.150
lattice, and this is a fairly
reasonable thing.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:22.230
This is pick the two shortest
translations, and that clearly

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.800
makes sense.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.510
There's absolutely nothing at
all to commend a cell that has

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.830
this as T2 and this as
T1 so you get a long,

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.982
skinny oblique things.

00:28:30.982 --> 00:28:35.460
Your natural inclination would
pick the two shortest

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.880
translations in the net.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.620
OK, so these are conventions.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.850
This has nothing to do with the
nature of the symmetry or

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.820
what makes it unique, but just
so that people have one

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.160
defined way of labeling
things.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.044
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:28:50.044 --> 00:28:51.370
[INAUDIBLE] my question
was actually that--

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.680
PROFESSOR: It was a good answer,
even if was not to the

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.990
question that you asked.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.372
AUDIENCE: I said the sixfold and
the threefold are exactly

00:28:59.372 --> 00:29:02.341
the same, but then I realized
they are because there is no

00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:03.085
crystal that can have threefold

00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:05.795
symmetry without sixfold.

00:29:05.795 --> 00:29:06.940
PROFESSOR: You were
doing fine.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.270
You should have quit just before
that last statement.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.950
How can you have a hexagonal
lattice that sometimes has

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.768
sixfold symmetry and sometimes
has threefold symmetry?

00:29:17.768 --> 00:29:21.430
Well, let me give you an example
for that, and it makes

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.015
a very useful point.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:37.480
Let me draw two hexagonal nets,
and in this one I'll put

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.890
a threefold axis.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:47.050
So I'll have one motif here,
I'll go 120 degrees away.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:52.350
Here is a motif here, and I'll
go 120 degrees away, and here

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:58.020
is a third motif.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.680
So these three guys form
a triangle about

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.030
this lattice point.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.740
And we would have about the
other lattice points at the

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:17.300
corners of the cell exactly the
same triangle of motifs,

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.880
and the same thing over here.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.720
So there is a pattern.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:33.240
It has a hexagonal lattice,
and it has a triangle of

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.740
objects related by
a threefold axis.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:46.480
And now let me take exactly the
same lattice, and now I'll

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.910
put in instead a sixfold axis.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:54.640
And that means I'm going to have
a hexagon of objects, and

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.120
it'll do something like this.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.430
And I don't want to push my
luck and try to draw that

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.460
twice, but there would be a
hexagon here and a hexagon of

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.460
motifs here, another one at
this lattice point, and

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.860
another one at this lattice
point here.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.110
Same lattice, same shape,
same dimensions--

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.420
although that's not critical--

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.440
but one of them has only
a threefold axis.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.850
One of them has only a
sixfold axis in it.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:21.480
Why?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.290
Because I decided to put a
threefold axis in this

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.030
pattern, and I decided to put
a sixfold axis in this

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.390
pattern, but they both end up
being contented and happy with

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.275
a lattice with the same degree
of specialization.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.930
Now we will come as we
progressed a little bit

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.660
further that we have to
go in two dimensions

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.200
to the reverse situation.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.100
We have a particular symmetry
and it's happy with two

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.980
different sorts of lattices
with different shapes and

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.780
different specializations,
and that's

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.270
going to come up directly.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.520
Any other questions?

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.040
Yeah.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.980
AUDIENCE: In this example,
the sixfold [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.445
axis [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:11.445 --> 00:32:12.695
It's just that [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.680
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.170
You're saying that here hanging
at this lattice point

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.270
is something that has
sixfold symmetry.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.460
Here is something has only
threefold symmetry.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:35.190
The nature of the lattice and
the symmetry that is in that

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.450
lattice are two inseparable
aspects of the pattern.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.840
But often, as we've seen here,
there's more than one

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.730
possibility for a
given lattice.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.750
And as we'll see very shortly,
for some other symmetries, for

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.470
one given symmetry, there are
two kinds of lattices.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:33:01.970
But nevertheless, the thing to
keep fixed in your mind is

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.800
that we call this a
hexagonal lattice.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.270
Why?

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:09.120
Because this translation is
equal to this one, and they

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.940
are exactly 120 degrees apart.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.540
That lattice can have that
specialness only if there's

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.460
either a threefold or a
sixfold axis in it.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.240
So the specialization of a
lattice is inseparable from

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.900
the symmetry that is in the
lattice that demands that

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.600
specialization of the lattice.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.940
Conversely, a lattice can have
the specialization only if you

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.180
place in a symmetry which
demands precisely that

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.740
specialization.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.450
So if you measure a lattice,
and this turns out to be

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:49.050
119.99 degrees and these turn
out to be 3.21 angstroms and

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:54.370
3.21 angstroms, that is not a
hexagonal lattice, because

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:57.450
there's no symmetry in there
that demands that this angle

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.100
be 120 degrees.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:06.180
And that may seem to be an
academic fine point, but we'll

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.489
see that in due course the
properties of a crystal depend

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:13.444
on the symmetry of
that crystal.

00:34:13.444 --> 00:34:17.239
If the crystal has symmetry, the
property also has to have

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.449
that symmetry.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.920
And it is the atoms inside the
cell which determine the

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.580
symmetry of the property, and
the properties is one aspect

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.620
of the symmetry that goes along
with lattice dimensions

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.442
and lattice angles.

00:34:30.442 --> 00:34:32.310
Is that clear?

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.330
So let me say it again,
because this is

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.679
an important point.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.920
The specialness of a lattice
is inseparable from the

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.610
symmetry that is existing in
that lattice that demands that

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.860
specialness.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.949
So if you have a crystal with
three orthogonal translations

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:54.050
that is equal in length as you
might care to measure, that

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.180
crystal is not cubic unless
there's symmetry in that

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.380
lattice that demands that the
edges of the cell conform to

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.630
the geometry of a cube.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.250
Any other questions?

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.230
Let's then in the time that's
remaining look at the other

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.540
symmetry element that could be
present in a two-dimensional

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:43.570
crystal, and that's
the mirror plane.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.910
So here's a mirror plane.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.090
That's the one remaining
symmetry element in two

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:55.250
dimensions, and let's ask how we
might combine in this space

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.700
along with the mirror
plane a translation.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:05.610
If I just pop in a translation,
and call this T1,

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.820
and for convenience, I'll take
the lattice point on the

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.870
mirror plane.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.636
Here's another lattice
point that sits here.

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.720
The mirror plane acts
on everything.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.470
It's going to take this lattice
point and flip it over

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.940
to here, and it's going to take
the translation that goes

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.280
from the origin lattice point to
this lattice point and give

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.240
me a T1 prime that sits here.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.310
And now I have two non collinear
translations, so

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:40.990
these have defined for me a
cell that looks like this.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:49.620
This is T1, this is T2, and
this is some angle alpha

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.120
between them.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.400
That's a special lattice.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.240
This is a lattice which has,
just as in the hexagonal or

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.660
square net, two translations
that are

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.480
identical in magnitude.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:03.870
Why?

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.650
Because they're repeated by a
mirror plane, and the angle

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.050
between them-- the angle
between T1 and T2--

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.120
is completely general.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.290
It can be anything it likes.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.030
It can close up to a very narrow
angle or it can open up

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.350
to an almost flat angle.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.750
That's a new kind of lattice.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.450
None of the preceding lattices
could make that claim.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:38.810
Now let me point out that this
is for the first time a case

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:44.030
where it would be much to our
advantage to not choose a cell

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.750
that contains one
lattice point.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.650
Let me put some dotted
lines in here.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.270
And let me submit--

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.160
these will also be
lattice points--

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:07.010
that I could pick a larger cell
that would have this as

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:12.830
T1, it would have this as T2,
and the angle between them now

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:17.020
would be identically 90
degrees because of the

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:22.310
geometry that gives
us a rhombus here.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.940
This would have two translations
that are not

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:31.520
equal in magnitude, and it would
have an angle between

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:39.060
these two translations that is
identically 90 degrees, but it

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:44.640
is no longer a cell that
contains one lattice point.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.975
It now catches a second
lattice point

00:38:46.975 --> 00:38:49.550
that's in the middle.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:59.600
So this is a double cell, and
it has a rectangular shape.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.245
It's a centered rectangular
lattice.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:15.730
Being a double cell that's
redundant has twice the area

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.920
that is unique in the pattern,
and anything that's hanging up

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:25.040
here is going to be hanging down
here, so it has a twofold

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.370
redundancy.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:32.280
But the thing that you get in
return for paying the price of

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.410
that redundancy is a cell that
has a right angle in it.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.300
And as we'll see, we're going
to use the edges of the unit

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.470
cell as the basis of a
coordinate system for

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.710
describing what goes on at
positions xy within the cell.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.460
And the advantages of an
orthogonal coordinate system,

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.780
whenever you can take advantage
of it, far outweighs

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.900
the price of pain--

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.660
twice the area to describe
the same pattern.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.190
So this is what is generally
taken as the standard cell.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.440
It's a double cell.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.880
But I think you're used to
that sort of compromise,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.270
because you've all heard of face
centered cubic lattices.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.960
The primitive cell in a face
centered cubic lattice is a

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.100
rhombohedron.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.600
But, oh, that Cartesian
coordinate system is so great

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.140
to use rather than something
that has an

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.680
oblique coordinate system.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.450
So is this is a definition
of convenience.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.830
Notice the curious duality--

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.890
either special relation between
the translations angle

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:47.350
general or special relation
between the translations, an

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:48.600
angle special.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.020
General translation, special
angle, relation between the

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.200
translation, general angle--

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.980
so, it's a curious
sort of duality.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.900
You can have one but not the
other or vice versa.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:13.380
So this is a fourth
sort of lattice.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:19.630
Number one, number two, number
three, and now we have number

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.400
four, which is a centered
rectangular lattice.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:46.460
And this particular lattice
has T1 not equal to T2 in

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:53.220
magnitude, but it has the
angle between T1 and T2

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.305
exactly 90 degrees, and
it's a double cell.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.840
It's centered.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.690
Are we done?

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.280
The reason I asked that silly
rhetorical question is that

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.490
obviously I suspect that we're
not done, and what

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.380
else might we do?

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.080
We got our centered rectangular
net by starting

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.460
with a translation--

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.320
starting with an mirror
plane, really--

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.430
and then we added a general
translation, and that

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:43.710
reflected it across and gave us
a diamond shaped net which

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:47.630
we could define as a rectangular
double shell.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.542
Does that always happen?

00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:53.280
Do I always get that oblique
diamond shaped cell?

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.660
No.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:06.690
Suppose I put in my first
translation deliberately in a

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.150
fashion such that it was at
exactly right angles to the

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.080
mirror plane.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.090
That mirror plane will then
reflect the translation and

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:21.050
change its direction, and
now I have generated a

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.160
one-dimensional lattice
row with

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.630
translational periodicity T1.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.020
And I've got a translation
that's exactly perpendicular

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.270
to the mirror plane.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.460
How do I now make a space
lattice, a two-dimensional

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.150
space lattice?

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:44.390
And the answer is
very carefully.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:49.575
Suppose I throw in a second
translation T2 and the mirror

00:43:49.575 --> 00:43:52.290
plane reflects it
across to here.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.760
This interval between lattice
points up here is totally in

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.710
commensurate with the
first translation,

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.280
and that won't work.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.670
It's violated my initial choice
of the translational

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:10.540
periodicity unless I do one of
two things, and let's try them

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.180
both and dispose of
this quickly--

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.050
this is straight away.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.120
Here's my one-dimensional
lattice row.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.670
I do not violate this
periodicity

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.650
T1 if I do two things.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:29.540
I could pick T2 so that it fell
exactly along the mirror

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.840
line, and that's going to
generate for me a new type of

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.880
lattice in which this is 90
degrees and these two

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.140
translations are unequal
in length.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.900
So this is a lattice that
has a rectangular shape.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:45:02.870
It's a primitive rectangular
cell, and it has T1 not equal

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:12.760
to T2 in magnitude, and
it has T1 and T2

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.480
exactly 90 degrees apart.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.950
The second choice that would
not result in any

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:26.540
contradiction would be to have
this as T1, and then pick T2

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:33.240
very carefully so that it
spanned the mirror line with

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.380
one half of T1 exactly
up here and one half

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.470
of T1 exactly here.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.590
And this would be compatible
with the separation T1 down at

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.760
the start of this translation.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.980
I think you can see that what
this is going to give me is

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.480
the centered rectangular net
right back again, so this is

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.300
the centered rectangular net--

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.140
nothing new.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:13.740
But we did pick up one
additional two-dimensional

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.420
lattice of distinct character.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:29.020
Number 5 is a primitive
rectangular network, and it

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:36.810
has the characteristics T1 is
not equal to T2 in magnitude.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:40.510
Just as in the centered
rectangular net, T1 is at

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:44.490
exactly 90 degrees to T2, but
this is a primitive cell.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:52.456
And that's it.

00:46:52.456 --> 00:46:56.280
We really set up the ground
rules for the geometry of a

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.170
periodic two-dimensional
space.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:04.190
There are five kinds
of rotation axes--

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.420
one, two, three,
four, and six.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:12.030
Each one requires one or
more of the specialized

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.040
two-dimensional lattices.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.970
We have a case where
interestingly two different

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.740
symmetries are compatible with
a lattice of the same

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.720
specialization.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.600
In the case of the [? hexagon ?]
on that, either

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.130
three or sixfold symmetry
could require that.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:31.730
In the case of the mirror plane
we have one symmetry

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.040
element, M, that can
fit into two

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.620
different kinds of lattices.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.630
So in one case, the same lattice
can take two different

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.310
symmetries.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.850
In this case, two different
lattices can accommodate the

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.100
same symmetry.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:51.430
So that's the story for two
dimensions, and we have just

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.740
one final thing to do.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:48:11.550
That is to add to the lattices
that we have found, and there

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:15.850
are five of them, and add
to the lattice point the

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:21.020
symmetries that we have
found require them.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:28.400
And there are a limited number
of these-- one, two, three,

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.760
four, or sixfold rotational
symmetry in a mirror plane.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:39.640
And when we have finished these
additions, we will end

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.110
up with a combination of lattice
and symmetry, which is

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.160
something that is called
a plane group--

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:57.840
group because the operations
that are present in the space

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:03.370
follow the requirements of the
mathematical entity called a

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:08.330
group, plane because this is
a distribution of symmetry

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.000
elements throughout a plane
and not just fixed at one

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.200
particular point.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.690
Let me finish with some general
observation, and we

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:23.110
will obtain some of these
rules later on.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.320
Suppose I take a pristine
space--

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.880
and this blackboard is
no longer pristine--

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.690
and I put in the space a
first operation, and

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.710
there's a motif in there.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:37.260
This first operation moves
around this first motif and

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.910
gives me a second
one, number two.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.850
Then I say let me put in
another operation.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:45.270
I'd like to combine these
things and see how many

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.360
different combinations
I have, so I put in

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.090
operation number two.

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:53.660
Operation number two will take
the second object and repeat

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.970
it to a third object.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.680
Number two is identical to
number one, so this gives me a

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.540
third object reproduced
from the second by

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.970
operation number two.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.920
Now I have a space, and
sitting in it are two

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.520
different operations and
three different motifs.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.260
Motif number one and motif
number three are the same darn

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.490
thing because they've been
repeated by symmetry steps, so

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:26.860
there must automatically be some
third transformation that

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.740
is equal to the combined effect
of going from one to

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.300
two and then from
two to three--

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.670
going from one to
three directly.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:40.040
So this is another truth
about these symmetries.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.790
Whenever you take two operations
and combine them in

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:52.060
a space, the net effect of those
two operations is equal

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.250
to a third operation.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.980
So a question we're going to ask
all along the way until we

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.480
are at the end of the month--

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.070
if you take a translation and
combine it with a mirror

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:07.270
plane, what new operation
has to arise?

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.470
If you take two rotation
operations and put them

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.370
together, what third net
operation has to arrive?

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:16.760
If we have some general rules,
then we can automatically say,

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.620
OK, I'm going to take a square
lattice and I'm going to put

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:19.800
in a fourfold axis.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.750
What else is going to pop up
elsewhere within the cell?

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.990
We'll be able to do this
systematically but fairly

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.240
automatically.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.530
So that's where we're
going from here.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:33.690
When we're done, we will have
derived systematically and

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:39.690
rigorously the sorts of
symmetries that can combine

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.200
symmetries such as rotation and
reflection with a lattice,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.340
and we will know completely
the different sorts of

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.130
patterns that exist around
us in two dimensions--

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:51.510
in floor tiles, brick
work, wrapping

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.130
paper, and plaid shirts.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:01.170
We'll pick up at this
point on Thursday.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:05.680
Let me caution you we are going
into territory that is

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.220
not covered in Berger's book.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.300
I've just passed
it out to you.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.720
What we've said in the early
parts of the term are in

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.290
there, but we're going to do
things in a slightly different

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.550
way and then return to
his text later on.

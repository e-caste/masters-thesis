WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.529
NICOLA MARZARI: Wonderful.

00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:02.029
OK.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.900
So welcome to class 5.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.520
We are actually counting the
lab as class 4 in the numbering.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.330
What we'll see today
is really a wrap-up

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.810
on some of these ideas on
the behavior of electrons

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.520
as quantum particles.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.800
And we'll introduce really
the first electronic structure

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.840
method in the modern sense--

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.970
that is Hartree-Fock theory--

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.200
that you'll see as a very
simple, conceptual framework.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.340
And it really derives directly
from the Schrodinger equation

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.980
and from the reformulation
of the Schrodinger equation

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.010
as a variational principle.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.800
Next class, we'll start with
density functional theory.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.830
That is a completely
different approach

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.900
to the problem
than Hartree-Fock.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.600
Although, in
practice, it results

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.900
in equations for the wave
function of the electron

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.660
that are formerly fairly simple.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.240
Historically, Hartree-Fock
has been the method

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.230
that has developed first,
especially from the quantum

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.580
chemistry community.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.790
And because it derives from
the variational principle,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.920
it can actually be augmented
with perturbation theory.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.090
So whenever you need very
accurate calculations,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.520
things like molar
[INAUDIBLE] approaches

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.340
and other perturbation
theory approaches

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.730
on top of Hartree-Fock
can actually help you out.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.010
But they tend to
be very expensive.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.510
OK.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.320
Let me, in one slide, remind you
of the most fundamental concept

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.020
from last class
that we have seen.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.300
That is the de Broglie relation.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.740
This is something that tells
us that if a particle has

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.460
a momentum mass times
velocity p, well,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.250
then there is a fundamental
constant in nature that is

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.980
called the Planck constant--
that's written here--

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.470
such that this
relation is satisfied

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.530
where lambda is the
wavelength of that particle.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.390
So basically, particles
have wavelength properties.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.920
But the real issue is that
only electrons are light enough

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.570
to have wavelength comparable
to the inter-atomic distance,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.402
so to give rise to
diffraction phenomena.

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:14.860
And so this is why
we actually need

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.340
to treat the electrons with
the Schrodinger equation

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.440
due to their
wavelike properties.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.710
And in general, we don't
really need to nuclei

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.020
as a wave-like particle.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.980
So this was one thing.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.090
The other important thing that
I'll repeat over and over again

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.950
is that when we move from a
particle-like description,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.990
where the only
important quantity are

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.190
the position and the momentum,
to a wave-like quantity, well,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.520
we have a completely different
computational content.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.920
That is, a wave
function is actually

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.850
defined by assigning the
amplitude of the wave

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.520
at every point in space
and at every time.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.930
So in practice, it's a continuum
field that in every, say,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.080
computational calculation
needs actually

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.300
to be discretized and
approximated in different ways.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.890
And then I introduced
what is the equivalent

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.780
of the Newton's second law of
dynamics for actually quantum

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.350
objects.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.390
So classical particles evolve
according to the law force

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.840
equals mass times
acceleration, where

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.250
the acceleration is really
the secondary derivative

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.640
of the trajectory.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.040
Quantum particles obey a
different fundamental law

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.740
that's basically been discovered
by Erwin Schrodinger in 1925.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.880
And the other major player where
Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.200
and many others.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.800
And I've written it here
in the most general form

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.270
for the case of a single
electron, so a particle

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.910
that is described
by a wave function

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.900
psi, a function
of space and time.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.872
Very good.

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:10.080
The machine [INAUDIBLE] beep.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.170
OK.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.680
Professor Ceder will
take care of this.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.950
And let me continue.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.760
So we have the descriptor
that is the wave function.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.911
And we have a potential.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.900
A potential is the
general concept.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.980
It could be, say, the
electromagnetic potential

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.980
that is coming from
the nucleus of an atom.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.920
So suppose that you are
studying a hydrogen atom.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.070
Well, the nucleus has
an attractive potential

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.340
for the electron that is
just 1 over the distance

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.380
between the electron
and the nucleus.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.530
So V here is really
the same potential

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.070
that you have learned
in classical dynamics

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.690
and electromagnetism.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.395
But now, instead of
acting on a particle,

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.520
it acts on the wave function.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.598
And the way it does, it just
multiplies the wave function.

00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:29.390
So what the Schrodinger
equation is telling

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.420
me is that whenever
I have a potential V,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.600
the solution for the
dynamics of the electron

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.720
will be given by the solution of
this second-order differential

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.570
equation, where here
this is a Laplacian.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.630
We have a second derivative
with respect to space.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.072
And so the wave function needs
to satisfy this equation.

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:53.600
In most cases, to actually
deal with problems

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.380
in which the potential
does not depend on time--

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.900
suppose that you are
studying a molecule.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.010
What is your potential?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.260
Think of, say, the
benzene molecule.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.240
Well, you have six carbon atoms
in a ring and six hydrogen

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.040
atoms also in a ring.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.700
And in each nucleus,
there is a Z/r

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.730
that is an attractive
potential for the electron.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.460
And that we can either
think of at a potential

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.950
that doesn't change in time--

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.160
or even if it changes,
because the molecule is

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.060
a certain temperature and
so atoms move around, what

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.920
it turns out will
happen in practice

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.180
is that electrons are so
much lighter than nuclei

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.660
that for all practical
purposes they

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.560
move so much faster that
they see the nuclei basically

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.760
as fixed in time.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.360
So if you think of a
particle like a nucleus that

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.150
has a huge mass and a
particle like an electron that

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.440
has a very light mass, well,
even if the nuclei move,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.110
the electrons always
are so much faster

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.320
to rearrange themselves to
be in the minimum energy

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.280
configuration.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.560
We'll actually see
more of what is

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.770
called adiabatic approximation.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.930
So the important
thing here is that,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.660
for all practical purposes,
we consider in most problems

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.320
the potential as not
really dependent on time

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.390
either because the
atoms are not moving

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.330
or because even if they
move, they move so much more

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.130
slowly than the electrons.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.902
Then the electrons can
always [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.050
The form that the wave
function can have.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.370
And I'll briefly sketch
out this derivation here.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.210
So whenever the potential
doesn't depend on time,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.010
this is how we proceed.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.620
We actually make an
hypothesis-- often,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.270
this is called an ansatz--

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.820
in which our wave
function can actually

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.070
be separated into the
product of two terms--

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.070
a term that depends
only on space,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:06.010
we'll call it phi; and a term
that depends only on time.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.600
So we are making
this hypothesis.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.290
We have decided that
the potential does not

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.880
depend on time.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.970
And we see what [AUDIO OUT].

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.820
What we have now
is that whenever

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.190
we apply, say, the Laplacian
secondary derivative

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.970
with respect to space,
well, [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.000
the f component of the function,
the time-dependent component.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.780
So the Laplacian of psi
can be written actually

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.460
as f times the Laplacian of phi.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.429
And then I'm not writing
the explicit dependence

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:44.540
on the variables.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.070
But we have the potential
times the wave function, phi f.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.890
And then we have i h bar.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.840
And now, the derivative with
respect to time of phi--

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.520
well, a phase-dependent
part is not affected.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.640
So we write it as
pih times df/dt.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.580
OK.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.480
So this is our first step.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.140
And now, we take
this expression.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:15.890
And we just divide it by
the product of phi times f.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.710
And so when I do
that, what I obtain

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:25.710
is minus h bar squared divided
by 2m Laplacian of phi divided

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:34.530
by phi plus V equal
to i h bar 1/f df/dt.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.510
And this really is the
end of the derivation

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.990
because something very
important happens at this point.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.810
Look for a moment at
the right-hand side

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.430
of this equation.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.400
You see it's just a constant--
the Planck constant, i,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.020
is the imaginary unit--

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.230
times 1/f df/dt.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.390
So everything that's written
on the right-hand side here

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.145
depends only on time.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.280
The left-hand side,
on the other hand,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.170
we have a term that
depends only on position.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.770
Phi is a function of position.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.860
And V-- remember, our
initial hypothesis--

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.340
does not depend on time.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.410
The potential does
not depend on time.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.390
So the left-hand
side [AUDIO OUT]..

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.620
Now, the only way such a
relation can be satisfied--

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.760
that is a term dependent
solely on position can be equal

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.070
to a term that
depends only on time--

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.250
is if each term separately.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.252
That's the only way the
overall function of r

00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:52.600
can be [AUDIO OUT]
overall function of t,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.770
if they are constant.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.750
Basically, because r and t
are independent variables,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.240
there is no relation.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.990
If you want, in this
ansatz [AUDIO OUT] down

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.450
the Schrodinger
equation in two parts--

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.620
the left part being
equal to a constant,

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.730
and the right part being
equal to a constant.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.660
So there is a simplification.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.420
We can deal with
separate equations

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.400
for the time-dependent part and
for the space-dependent part.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.930
What is the left-hand term
equal to a constant becomes

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.122
what is called the stationary
Schrodinger equation.

00:11:33.122 --> 00:11:34.580
That is the equation
that we'll try

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.950
to solve over and over
again in our calculation.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.930
And it's the term that
I've written here.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.370
So the stationery Schrodinger
equation is written here.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.170
And this is the
differential equation

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.290
that, in principle,
is complex to solve

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.990
because the potential can have
an arbitrary complex shape.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.720
But again, think
of the potential

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.490
as being the
attractive potential

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.200
for the electrons generated by
all the nuclei in a molecule

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.820
or in a solid.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.850
And the time [AUDIO OUT] has
become trivial to integrate.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.620
And we see this is the time part
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.920
We see, actually,
in the next slide

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.050
why this is simple
because this is just

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.300
a first-order
differential equation.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.210
And we are looking, in
general, for a function

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.390
whose first derivative
with respect to time

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.145
is equal to the function
itself times a constant.

00:12:34.145 --> 00:12:36.550
[AUDIO OUT] equation
to integrate

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.720
because the exponential function
satisfies this condition.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.700
When you take the
exponential, you just

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.340
get the exponential
itself times a constant.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:52.250
And so really, there is
no analysis [AUDIO OUT]

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.520
The other part, the
space-dependent part

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.830
is the one that is
complex to solve.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:04.346
And we'll see here just a
few examples [AUDIO OUT]

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:07.940
If we want the simplest
example possible,

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.160
that is the case
of a free particle.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.090
What happens to an electron
that doesn't feel any potential?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.870
And again, its wave
function is going

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.770
to be the product of a
space-dependent part phi

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.380
times a time-dependent part f.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.855
The f term [AUDIO OUT].

00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:35.680
The space-dependent term
here is the solution

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.400
of the stationary Schrodinger
equation in the hypothesis

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.520
that the potential
V is equal to 0.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.021
So I've removed from the
stationary [AUDIO OUT]..

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.060
Again, this is a fairly
simple differential equation

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.410
to integrate because what we
are looking for is basically

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.920
a function whose
secondary derivative is

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.520
equal to the function
itself times a constant.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.410
And then again, the solution is
just given by an exponential,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.670
OK?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.740
Now, I'm looking in particular
at the problem in which I'm

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:21.350
trying to find a solution phi
for a value of this constant E

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.040
that is positive.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.430
And so when you actually
work out the algebra,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.180
you see that what you
need as a term in front

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.680
of the x in the exponential
is the square root

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.660
of a negative number,
is the square root

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.910
of twice the mass times E
divided by h bar squared.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:46.010
And so that's why we get
this imaginary unit here.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.640
It's basically because we
have rewritten this equation

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:58.220
as the square Laplacian of
phi equal to minus 2mE divided

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.670
by h bar squared f.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.790
And you see
straightforwardly that if you

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.020
take the secondary whatever
of the functions that

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.360
are written here,
well, we'll get,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.250
by taking the first
derivative, a term

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.245
i square root of 20
divided by h bar.

00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:17.870
And when we take the
second derivative,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.460
we get that term again.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.120
And the square of that
term is a square of i

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.500
that gives you my minus sign.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.200
OK.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.370
So this is the solution.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.560
We have actually found the wave
function for our free particle.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.940
And the wave function
is the product

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.460
of [AUDIO OUT] times
the time-dependent part.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.490
And in the next
slide, I am actually

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:50.160
plotting this wave
function in space.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.400
Sorry, let me jump
to this slide.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.170
This is it.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.480
So I am plotting it.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.150
For simplicity, I've called
it a different coefficient.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.090
E over h bar, I've
called it omega.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.890
And square root of 2mE divided
by h bar, I've called it t.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.450
So this is the wave function
for a free electron.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.140
And this is what we
call a plane wave.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.920
And the reason why
is that is simple

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.460
because if you think
of what this term is,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.070
the exponential of
a complex number

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.350
is really a combination
of sines and cosines.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:36.330
And now, suppose that you look
at the amplitude of this wave

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.080
function at a certain
point in space--

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.460
that is at a certain
x equal to x0.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.640
What you see is
that that amplitude

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.000
will have a kx factor that
doesn't change because we

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.850
are sitting at a certain x0.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.550
But what is changing
with respect to time

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.100
is the second term, omega t.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.900
And so you see an oscillating
amplitude with a period

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.130
omega at any point in time.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.430
Or in a different
way, if for a moment

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.660
you think that what is this
field of the wave function

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.450
at a frozen instant in time--

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.020
that is for a certain
time t equal to t0--

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.690
well, it's nothing else
than a complex exponential.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.680
So it's a
complex-valued function

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.010
that has a cosine or sine
projection, depending

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.650
if we look at the
real or complex axes.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.170
So what you need
to think of when

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.540
you think that at
a free electron

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.950
is nothing else than
this infinite oscillatory

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.550
field propagating in space.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.360
But it has really no
beginning and no end.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.190
And one of the important things
is that the wave function

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.480
really contains all the
information that we might

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.780
want to know about an electron.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.210
And we will see
in the next slides

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.610
how we actually obtain
the physical properties

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.130
about an electron
from the function.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:17.300
But the simplest
property in [AUDIO OUT]

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.660
of finding an electron
in a certain position

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.440
and a certain time.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.470
And so [INAUDIBLE] that
wave function amplitude

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.700
at a certain x and
a certain t gives me

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.900
actually the
physical probability

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.850
of finding an electron.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.720
That means that if I have the
wave function of an electron,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.720
I can take at every
point in space

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.280
the square models
of its amplitude.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.080
And so what I have now is
a probability distribution.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.180
And what quantum
mechanics tells me

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.610
is that if I'm going
to make a measurement

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.700
and try to see where
the electron is,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.190
well, I will find it
in different points

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.520
in space with a
probability [AUDIO OUT]

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.370
into these square models.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.480
And you see one of the first
conclusions from our analysis

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.170
of the Schrodinger equation in
the case of a potential that

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.000
does not depend on time is a
Schrodinger equation in which

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.670
the wave function can
actually be written

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.480
as the product of a space
part times a time part

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.010
is that the probability of
finding the electron somewhere

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.470
does not depend
on time basically

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.630
because [INAUDIBLE]
square models

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:41.330
of psi that can also
be written as psi

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.570
times its complex conjugate.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:49.310
What you have is that the
term exponential of minus i/h

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.560
gets multiplied by
its complex conjugate.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.080
That is the exponential
of plus i/h.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.550
And those terms cancel out.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.470
So in the probability
distribution for the electron,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.490
we have only the square
models of the space part.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.070
That is to say that the
probability of finding

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.670
an electron does
not depend on time.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.570
It's just a function of space
if the potential does not

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.660
depend on time.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.440
You see, [INAUDIBLE]
our plane wave.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.330
The potential does
not depend on time.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.790
If we take the square
models of this function,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.900
well, what we have
is really a constant

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.740
because we are just taking
an imaginary exponential

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.150
times its complex conjugate.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.610
And so that product
is a constant.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.380
So what we discover really
is that the electron

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.630
is free as a probability
distribution that is constant.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.770
That is, you can find a free
electron anywhere in space.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:55.688
Yes?

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:59.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.930
NICOLA MARZARI: So this
is actually the solution

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.820
in three dimensions.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.580
So what the difference is,
if you work out the algebra--

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.190
and we can look at
it after class--

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.160
is that what you have is--

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:21.250
in the space term, you have
really a scholar product

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.840
in three dimensions.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.980
That is, what you
have is that now

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.860
a point in your
three-dimensional space

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.520
is described by a
three-dimensional vector r.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.010
And now, you can have
solutions that are classified--

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:43.990
if you want, this k is actually
called the quantum number.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.680
It's what classifies all
this possible continuum

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.280
of solutions.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.690
And if you think,
k is telling you

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.630
what the wavelength
of this plane wave is

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.100
and what is its orientation.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.950
So really, what I
am plotting here

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.980
is specific plane waves
that, if you want,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.840
is a k vector that is
ordered in this direction.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.040
So if we were in one dimension,
you have, if you want,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.410
the equivalent of
a sine or a cosine.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.310
And your only degree of
freedom is the wavelength.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.960
But if you are in
three dimensions,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.600
your degrees of freedom are
not only the wavelength--

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.610
that is the distance
between these crests--

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.530
but also this direction.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:32.660
And any arbitrary k
vector is actually valid.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.270
So you can have plane waves
with all possible wavelengths

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.360
and all possible orientations.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.910
And actually, this
gives me a good chance

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.530
to mention another sort
of physical observable

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.720
that comes from
the wave function.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.690
The first one that we have
seen is the probability

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.920
distribution.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.580
And that's obtained by
taking the square models.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.810
Another one is what is called
the quantum kinetic energy

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.260
of that particle.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.980
And the quantum kinetic
energy is really just

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:12.730
given by minus h bar
squared divided by 2m.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.700
So the quantum kinetic
energy is given-- well,

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.420
I'll describe it in
more detail in a moment.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.270
But it is obtained
by really taking,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.000
in a slightly more complex
way than what I am saying now,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.850
the second derivative
of the wave function.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.770
So the second derivative
here with respect

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.740
to the space of
this wave function

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.070
would give me a k square term.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.250
That basically means that a
plane wave with all wavelengths

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:48.310
corresponds to electrons
with all possible energies.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.050
But there is
something other that

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.290
is very subtle that
is reminiscent of what

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:57.220
in quantum mechanics people call
the indetermination principle.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.220
So this free
electron, as you see,

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.390
is an electron that is
distributed equally in space.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.420
So we can find it
with equal probability

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.000
here, here, or everywhere else.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.543
And it is actually a perfectly
well-defined second derivative

00:24:15.543 --> 00:24:16.460
with respect to space.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.690
It has a perfectly
well-defined kinetic energy,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.720
has a perfectly
well-defined momentum.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.100
And that's really one example of
the indetermination principle.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.170
That is, there is
a fundamental rule

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.630
that quantum particles satisfy.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.480
That is, you can't
actually measure

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.150
their momentum
and their position

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.590
simultaneously with
arbitrary accuracy.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.050
And so a free
electron, if you want,

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.270
is an electron that has
perfectly well-defined

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.260
momentum, perfectly
well-defined kinetic energy.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.150
And for this reason, it has
perfectly undefined position.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.960
That is, the electron
can be found anywhere.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.610
And so this is, if you
want, an exotic result

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:11.920
coming from the Heisenberg
indetermination principle.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.050
I wanted to give you
another physical example,

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.530
getting closer to reality.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.710
Suppose that, for a moment, we
are studying a metal surface.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.520
This wouldn't be very different
from what you have studied

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.020
in your first laboratory.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.720
What you are studying
is basically a slab.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.430
And you have been
finding quantities

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.400
like what is the energy, what
is the lattice parameter, what

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.090
is the surface energy.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.140
Suppose that now you are
using quantum mechanics.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.510
Well, what do the electrons
in the metal look like?

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:55.540
And we'll see in next classes
that an electron inside a metal

00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:01.170
really feels and behaves very
much like a free particle,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.840
especially in very
simple metals, in metals

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.620
like sodium, potassium, even
aluminum to a certain point.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.130
There is a very
delicate cancellation

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.820
of attractive and
repulsive terms

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.710
for the electron in the metal.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.950
So the net result, to a
very good approximation,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.560
is that the high
energy electrons,

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.740
the valence electrons,
really feel almost free.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.790
I'm saying almost free
because they are really

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.920
confined inside the
box that is your metal

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.300
crystal inside the box that
is given by your metal slab.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.900
And so to have a simple but
very good approximation,

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:49.110
we can think of the potential
felt by an electron in a metal

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.330
as a type of potential.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:57.420
I'm thinking of a case in which,
on this side, on the left,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.180
I have really my
semi-infinite slab.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.930
And so the potential that
is drawn by this thick line

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.550
is actually 0 for
x smaller than 0.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.010
And then there is a confinement.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.780
So there is a step.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.970
This is a little
bit like a well.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.360
There is a potential
difference v0

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.270
that contains the
electron inside the slab.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.170
So you really need
to pay an energy v0

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.190
to get out of the slab.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.370
But this is in physical
terms what people would

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.080
think of as the work function.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.540
The work function
is really the energy

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.380
that you need to pay to
pick up the highest energy

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.920
electron in the metal and
bring it out, bring it very far

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.020
away from your slab.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.170
And so to a good
approximation, the potential

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.420
that these electrons
close, as we say,

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.620
to the Fermi energy
feel is this.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.140
And what we are
trying to find now

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.280
is a solution for the
Schrodinger equation

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.970
for a case of an electron
having an energy.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.320
Actually, the E, that constant
in the Schrodinger equation,

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.750
is actually the total
energy of the particle.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.860
So we are looking for a
solution for an electron having

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.940
an energy that is
basically between 0 and v0.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.580
That means that that
electron classically

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.630
is really confined to the
left side of the potential.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.590
And so what do we have here?

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.990
Well, what we have is that,
on the left, we have again,

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.350
a very simple
Schrodinger equation

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:42.360
that is minus h bar
squared over 2m d

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:49.170
squared over phi
equal to E times phi.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.350
So this is, on the left side,
the Schrodinger equation

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.760
for the free particle.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.550
And we know the solution.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.780
And it's just being given
by one of these plane waves.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.290
But now, the difference
is that, on the right,

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.330
we have all of a
sudden a potential.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.990
So the equation on
the right is going

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:15.420
to be minus h bar squared over
2m times delta squared phi.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.420
Remember now, in the stationary
Schrodinger equation,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.810
we have a term that is
given by the potential that,

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.380
in this case, is just a constant
times the wave function.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.846
And this is going to
be equal to d phi.

00:29:30.846 --> 00:29:34.830
What's the difference
between these two equations?

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.620
Well, let me actually rewrite
the one on the right side

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.530
as minus h bar
squared over 2m delta

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:50.550
squared phi equal
to E minus v0 phi.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.590
Well, in both
cases, we are trying

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.970
to find a wave function
whose second derivative

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.300
is basically equal to
the wave function itself

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.310
times a constant.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.590
But the big difference
is that we are actually

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.950
looking for physical
solutions for an electron that

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:12.460
has an energy lying
somewhere in between 0--

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.190
that is our
conventional minimum--

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.210
and v0.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.610
That is the energy cost
to get that electron out.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:24.030
So what we have is that, for
the left side equation, what

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.720
we are trying to find
is a second derivative

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.700
in which, you see,
the constant is

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.420
going to be minus 2mE
over h bar squared.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.870
So it's a negative number.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.930
So we need to take
a second derivative

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.740
and get a function
times a negative number.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.860
In the other case, remember,
what we are looking

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.170
is for a solution in which the
energy is between 0 and V0.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:54.390
So this the sign of the
coefficient here has changed.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.500
Here, before, it was positive.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.700
Now, it's negative.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.790
And with the negative
sign on the other side,

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.910
it means that what
we are looking

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.240
is for a function
whose secondary what

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.020
is equal to a positive constant
times the function itself.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.700
And all this long
story is just to say

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.460
that the solution
on the left will

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.920
be given by an exponential
that has an i term in there.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.080
So it's a complex exponential.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.480
Well, the solution on
the right-hand side

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.390
will be given by
an exponential that

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.090
has a real term coefficient.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:34.140
And so what we have
is on the left side

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.800
a periodic oscillatory solution
typical of the free electron.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.310
And what we have
on the right side

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.730
is actually a
decaying exponential.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.910
And so what we have is
that our free electron is

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:51.930
going to have a wave function
that really looks like this--

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:57.150
free particle like inside the
oscillatory and exponentially

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.820
decaying outside the surface.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.020
And this is how truly
electrons in a metal--

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.770
and in most metals, it
looks like the wave function

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.690
decays exponentially.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.360
That's actually why
people, say in 1981,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.200
could invent something as
fancy as the scanning tunneling

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.920
microscope.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.400
You see, the STM is one of
the fanciest instruments

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.910
that we have that can
actually be used to see atoms.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.120
And what does an STM do?

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.970
Well, an STM comes with
really a nanometer-sized tip.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:39.100
And what the STM measures
is the current between, say,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.130
the metal and the tip.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.020
And it's very
sensitive because, you

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.220
see, since the wave function
decays exponentially,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:52.230
moving the tip by a small
amount will change exponentially

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.950
the current going through the
scanning tunneling microscope.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.990
So we can actually
move this paper

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.870
and have an enormous
response in the current

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.740
to a very small displacement.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.700
So we can actually
measure the topography

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.120
on the top of a metal
surface with great accuracy

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.070
because basically what
the scanning tunneling

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.220
microscopy is doing
is really filling up

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.850
these exponentially
decaying tails coming out

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:22.230
from the metal, coming out
from the metal surface.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.740
OK.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.750
So I'll show you just
a few examples so

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.380
that we get more and
more the feeling of how

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.250
wave functions look,
getting closer and closer

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.470
to physical problems.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.330
Keep in mind this general idea--

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:40.020
if we have got
zero potential, we

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.190
have this wave-like solution.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.420
So a typical problem that is
very simple to actually solve

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.330
analytically would be
the one in which we

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.160
have an infinite square well.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.800
That is, we have a
particle that feels

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.270
zero potential between,
say, minus a and a

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.420
and infinite potential outside.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.770
And this qualitatively starts
to be very similar to what

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.825
an electron in an atom feels.

00:34:06.825 --> 00:34:08.670
And electron in an
atom doesn't really

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.360
feel a potential that is 0 in
a region and infinite outside.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.440
It really feels an attractive
potential that is 1/r.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.770
So the potential is actually
shaped very differently.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:23.760
It's going to be a Coulombic
cusp ending up in 0.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.070
But you see, the solutions
are very similar.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.840
And we can understand
them better

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.739
if we actually look at the
solution for this case.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:35.070
And again, what we have
is a problem in which,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:39.370
between minus a and a,
we have 0 potential.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:45.179
So the solutions are going to be
free electron-like, wave-like.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:48.389
But now, we have
a new condition.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.825
That is, what we have is
that being the potential

00:34:51.825 --> 00:34:56.350
is infinite, say from this
point onwards on the right

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.410
and from this point
downwards on the left,

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.040
what we need to have
is that the wave

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.990
function needs to have 0
amplitude outside this region.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.460
If the potential
is infinite, you

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.140
can think physically that there
is 0 probability of finding

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:13.950
the electron.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:14.805
It's truly infinite.

00:35:14.805 --> 00:35:17.710
So it's fully
constraining the electron.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.010
So the wave function
needs to be 0

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.220
from here onwards and
from here onwards.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.390
And so another great
discovery of quantum mechanics

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:32.550
is that the only sine
or cosine-like solutions

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.560
of the Schrodinger
equation that are

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.030
such that they have 0 amplitude
at this point and at this point

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.000
there are sines or cosines
with a wavelength that is

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.100
compatible with this distance.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.820
So all of a sudden,
our solutions that,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.680
in the case of
the free electron,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.060
could have any
wavelength in the world

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.360
have now become quantized.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.080
There is only a discrete set
of solutions with wavelengths

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.250
that are compatible with
the distance between the two

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.360
infinite, confining sides.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:13.950
And this is the same concept
of an organ pipe and the music

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.120
that it plays.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.590
When you play music in an organ
pipe, you are really exciting

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.520
either a sound wave with
a wavelength corresponding

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.410
to the fundamental harmonica.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:30.390
Or the only other notes that
your organ pipe can produce

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.250
are actually higher harmonics.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.970
And so they are,
again, sound waves

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.210
that will have 0
amplitudes at the borders.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.600
Or same thing, say, with
the chord of a guitar.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.980
And so the wave functions
for a confined potential

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.260
are actually quantized.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.470
And they have
corresponding energies--

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.340
that is, in this specific case,
go actually as the square.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.170
Although, this is less
relevant for our case.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.500
So you will see
that, in most cases,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.810
like when we look
at the solution

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:08.820
for an atom in a confining
Coulombic potential,

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.620
we'll actually find only a
discrete set of wave functions

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.840
with discrete energy levels.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.880
And again, we can
get some hints on how

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.070
this solution would look like.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.990
If you think for
a moment at what

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.280
would happen if our square
well, instead of having

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.380
infinite confining walls, would
have only finite confining

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.440
walls with a finite
height, it's really

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.290
the same case as
the metal surface

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.050
because now you
have a finite wall.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:49.020
You have a finite wave
function decaying exponentially

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.550
outside in that region.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.920
And so what was, you remember,
our fundamental harmonic--

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.770
the second harmonic, third
harmonic, fourth harmonic,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.670
what were those oscillatory
solutions inside the box

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:08.100
now start getting these
exponential tails decaying

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.520
in the vacuum.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.490
And this is really how
solutions for the Schrodinger

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.560
equation of an atom look like.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.560
And I don't want really to
bore you with the algebra.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.520
Some of you might actually have
seen this over and over again,

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.500
if you have taken
a quantum class.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:31.050
I'll just give you one slide
with the conceptual framework

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.810
of what we should do if we
were to solve the Schrodinger

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:39.100
equation for a single
electron in what we

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.850
call a central potential.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.370
This is a general concept.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.830
Central potential
is a potential that

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.880
depends only on the
distance from a center,

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.390
but not on the angle
of distribution.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.220
And so central
potential would be

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.440
written as V of r, where r
is the modulus of our vector,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.030
is just the distance.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.580
And the algebra
is fairly complex.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.630
But the general idea
is that this is now

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.250
our Schrodinger equation.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.130
We need to find a
wave function such

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.400
that the application of
the second derivative plus

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.650
this potential is
equal to the wave

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.900
function itself
times a constant.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.640
And because somehow
we are dealing

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.860
with the geometry of
a central potential,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.850
it's convenient to
write the Laplacian,

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.600
the second derivative, not
in Cartesian coordinate,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.820
but in spherical coordinates--
that is, in coordinates which,

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.410
instead of giving the x, y,
and z components of a vector,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.790
we give the distance from
the origin and the two

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.610
angles, theta and phi,
that that vector makes

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.340
with respect to different axes.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.480
Again, the solution
is fairly complicated.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.610
So I won't really go into this.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.550
But this is how
our Hamiltonian--

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.840
this is how the left part
of the stationary equation

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.870
would look for this
central potential,

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:06.340
having just rewritten basically
this second derivative

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.560
in Cartesian coordinates.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.150
And when one goes
through all the algebra,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.270
one finds out that
the function--

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.420
the space part of
the wave function

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.770
can be written as a
term that depends only

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.820
on the distance from the
center, from the place where

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.200
the nucleus is, times
an angular part.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.090
And if you are
familiar with this,

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.930
we call this angular
part spherical harmonics.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:41.110
And this would be the radial
part of the wave function.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:46.210
That is a solution of a slightly
different, one-dimensional

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.320
Schrodinger equation.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.810
Again, this is just
the start, if you

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.460
are interested to take this.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:57.580
But somehow, this is all
the algebra that gives rise

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.810
to the periodic table.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.730
That is, when we
study actually what

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.680
are the solutions
of the Schrodinger

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.080
equation for a
central potential,

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.130
well, we find that we can
classify the solution as we

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.150
were classifying the solution
in the particle in a box

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:17.080
depending on, if you want,
the fundamental harmonic

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.490
and the higher harmonics.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.640
Well, we can still classify
the solution depending

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.840
on the angular distribution--

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.100
so what are actually
the L and M indices

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.110
of the spherical harmonics.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:33.190
And we can also classify
the radial distribution.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.500
And so all these
possible solutions

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:42.070
give us all the possible states
of an electron in a hydrogen

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.910
atom.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.860
And you probably have seen
this over and over again.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.450
But it's really the fundamental
alphabet that gives rise

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.930
to the periodic table.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.820
So for the hydrogen atom,
the fundamental solution

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.630
is one in which the
electron is distributed

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.210
with spherical symmetry
around the nucleus.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.500
And if we look at the
probability density

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.230
as a function of the
distance from the center,

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:12.620
it's something that really
looks a little bit like this.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:19.710
So the probability of finding
the electron in the hydrogen

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.110
atom at a certain
distance really

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:30.270
has a maximum at a distance that
is, I believe, at 1.5 bohrs.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.000
I need to check
actually this number.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.780
The classical radius of the
hydrogen atom is 1 bohr.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.570
It's 0.529 Angstrom.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.090
And the maximum, I
think, is at 1.5.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.790
But basically, there is
a maximum of probability.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.230
And then it decays again.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.290
But then there is
a whole zoology

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:56.550
of excited states that
can have, say, a more

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.980
complex radial part.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.200
And we classify these--
you probably remember

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.520
this from your chemistry.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.150
We call this state
a 1s state where

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.030
1 really refers
to the radial part

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.730
and s refers to
the angular part.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.670
And the next state would
be a 2s-like state,

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:18.840
in which, being s, the angular
part is still the same.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.700
It's spherically symmetric.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.820
But now, the radial
part has changed.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.380
And it actually changed sign.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.930
So it goes inside.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.160
Then it goes back to 0.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.150
Then it goes again.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.980
And it goes back to 0.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.800
And then there are
states like the 2p states

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.340
in which the angular part
starts to play a role.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.000
And so this would be a specific
p state that, if you want,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.690
has two lobes with
opposite signs

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.580
across a plane of symmetry.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.520
And then there are more complex
states like the d states

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.570
and so on and so forth.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:56.160
And a very important thing
is that really this angular

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:02.370
symmetry comes from just having
considered a central potential.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.710
That is a potential
that doesn't depend

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.230
from the angular variable,
but just from the distance.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:14.040
And so these solutions have
the same qualitative difference

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.840
not only for a single
electron in a hydrogen atom,

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:24.360
but, say, in general for an
electron in an atom where

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.600
really that electron
will feel not

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.070
only the attractive
potential of the nucleus,

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:34.440
but also the repulsive potential
from all the other electrons.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.880
But to a great extent,
that repulsive potential

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.520
of all the other
electrons is going

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.290
to be a fairly spherical
symmetry kind of potential

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.620
because all the other electrons,
when you take their charge

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.140
density, are going to
be roughly spherically

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.930
symmetrically distributed.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.590
And so the solution
really, for one electron

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.990
in a central potential,
does not only apply

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.360
to the hydrogen
atom, but applies

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.990
to really any atom
in the periodic table

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.160
to some approximation.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.440
That is to the approximation
that we consider.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.490
The repulsive potential
that all the other electrons

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:19.410
have for this, say, top valance
electron in a generic atom, say

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.870
iron, is that the
only approximation

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:24.870
is that these repulsive
potential is also

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.520
spherically symmetric.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:33.060
That is not true but is
true to a very large extent.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.810
OK.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:38.070
Now, this concludes, if you
want, our general panorama

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.440
on what is quantum mechanics.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.250
And now, really, we want to
go into electronic structure

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:44.970
methods.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.570
That is, we want to arrive at
what is called the Hartree-Fock

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:49.410
solution.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.140
That is, again, one of the
fundamental techniques,

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.510
especially in quantum chemistry.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.210
And to do this, I
need to give you

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.890
a little bit of nomenclature.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.710
Again, if you have never seen
a set of quantum mechanics

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:04.410
or if you have never taken
a quantum mechanics class,

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.800
it would be very useful to have
a look at some of the books

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.200
that I've given you in
the bibliography, either

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.390
some fundamental books
like Quantum Mechanics

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.340
or Physics of Atoms
and Molecules,

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.850
both by Bransden and Joachain,
that are very good quantum

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.970
mechanics books, or some of
the electronic structure books,

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.420
like the Phoenix books
on inter-atomic forces

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:28.440
or the Richard Martin
book, or the Kaxiras book.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.660
But the nomenclature that
we'll use over and over again

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.980
is what is called the bracket
nomenclature of the Dirac.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.310
And so in general,
a wave function

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.700
is actually represented
by this sign here.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.020
This is called [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:50.070
Again, that means nothing
else than our function.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.850
That is an amplitude
defined everywhere

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.340
in space or everywhere
in space and time.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:01.470
And in general, it's
a complex amplitude.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:06.450
And now, one of the fundamentals
of the rules of quantum

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:10.770
mechanics is that,
say, a wave function

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.390
corresponding to different
states of an electron--

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.690
say you are considering the
function for the ground state

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.120
of the hydrogen atom, the 1s.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.600
And then you are considering the
function for an excited state,

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.290
like the 2s.

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.470
So the wave function
for different states

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:30.020
are going to be orthonormal.

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.380
What does it mean?

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:34.880
It means that when we
take the scalar product,

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.960
that scalar product is
going to be either 0 or 1,

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.245
depending if we are taking the
scalar product with the wave

00:47:42.245 --> 00:47:46.380
function itself or with the wave
function of a different state.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:50.660
So this delta ij is what is
called usually a chronicle

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.170
delta.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.590
It's a symbol that means this
is going to be equal to 1

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:58.160
if i is equal to j or is
going to be equal to 0

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.710
if i is different from j.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.760
And the scalar product
between two wave functions

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.390
is written in shorthand
notation as this.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:12.710
It's written as a bra
times a ket, a bracket.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.310
But again, that's nothing
else than a shorthand

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:21.470
form for the proper definition
of the scalar product.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:25.760
Again, you are probably not
heard of Hilbert spaces.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.580
But this is a vector
space of wave function

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.350
that has a metric defined.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.800
And so we can define something
like a scalar product

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.910
by taking the integral
of the wave function

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:40.820
on the left that
has been complex

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.510
conjugated times the wave
function on the right.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:48.350
So all wave functions that
are solutions of a Schrodinger

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.110
equation satisfy this
orthonormality normality

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.130
property.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.330
If you take this integral,
that is going to be equal to 1

00:48:56.330 --> 00:49:00.080
if you are just taking the
square of the wave function.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.650
And it's going to be equal
to 0 if i is different to j.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.605
And you see why it's
equal to 1 actually

00:49:06.605 --> 00:49:09.320
if i is equal to
j because remember

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.610
what is psi i star times psi i?

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.540
Well, it's just a
square modulus of psi i.

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:23.270
So psi i star times psi i in
a certain point r in space

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.300
gives me the probability
of finding the electron

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.920
in point in space.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.020
And when I integrate that
probability all over space,

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.110
it becomes obvious that
that number must be 1

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.650
because what is the probability
of finding an electron anywhere

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:40.440
in space?

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.150
Well, you'll find it somewhere.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.360
So the probability of
finding it anywhere--

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:52.940
that is the integral of psi
squared as a function of r--

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.740
must be equal to 1.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.610
So that's the
physical connection.

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.840
And the last
definition that I need

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.110
is that of expectation values.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.180
That is, once we
have found a wave

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.760
function for this electron--

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.880
as I said, we know
everything that we need

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.920
to know about that electron.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.420
And so we can extract all
the physical properties

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.070
that we want.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.350
It's like, in
classical mechanics,

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:37.050
if you have the trajectory
of your electrons,

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:42.360
you can calculate at any instant
in time what is, say, 1/2 times

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.220
the mass times the
square velocity.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.830
That would be the kinetic
energy of that particle.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:51.810
Similarly, if you know the
wave function of that electron,

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:57.060
you can calculate any
kind of physical quantity.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.570
And one of the most important
physical quantities,

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.330
apart from the probability
of finding it somewhere,

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:07.290
is what is the energy
of that electron.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:13.530
And this is the shorthand term
in the bracket nomenclature

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:17.460
of what would be the
energy of an electron.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.920
We call this an
expectation value.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:25.590
So in quantum mechanics, for
every physical observable,

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:30.600
like the energy, there is
going to be an operator that

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.040
acts on the wave function and
is such that its expectation

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.360
value gives me the physical
quantity I'm interested in.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.680
So if I want to know the energy
of an electron that has a wave

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.820
function psi i, I need to
calculate this expectation

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.700
value, psi h psi i--

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.830
that will give me the energy.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:57.120
And the quantum
mechanical operator

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.260
that gives me the energy is
what is called the Hamiltonian

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.560
operator, h, that
I've written here.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.290
So the Hamiltonian
operator is nothing else.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.760
And I forgot it here.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.670
And sorry, there is a Laplacina.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.590
The Hamiltonian
operator is nothing

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:19.590
else what we have seen in
the Schrodinger equation.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:24.180
It's minus h bar squared
divided by 2m times

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.860
the Laplacian plus
the potential.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.710
So if you want to
calculate what is

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:32.430
the energy of this electron,
what you need to do

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:37.710
is to apply the energy operator,
that is the Hamiltonian,

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.520
to the wave function.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.450
So you need to take the
second derivative with respect

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.280
to the wave function.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.410
With the appropriate
coefficient,

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:51.100
you need to sum the potential
times the wave function.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.150
And now, to this
new quantity that

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.840
is again a field that
is a function of r,

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.900
well, you need to
take that multiplied

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.500
by the complex conjugate
of the wave function

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.840
and integrate it all over space.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.590
So if you want, it's a much
more complex operation.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:14.280
But that's exactly what are
the rules for quantum objects.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.990
You have a Schrodinger equation.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.180
You find its solutions.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.170
And then the solutions are the
ground state or the excited

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.530
state wave function.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.110
And if you want
to calculate what

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.810
are the physical
values of what we

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:31.080
say are observable
quantities, like the energy,

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.780
you need to take an
expectation value

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.820
of the appropriate operator.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.490
And if you want the most
fundamental operator,

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:43.050
it's the Hamiltonian h
that is just written here.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:46.710
And the expectation value that
is written in shorthand form

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:50.310
here is nothing else but
the integral overall space

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.120
of the complex
conjugate of the wave

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:58.200
function times what we obtain
by applying to the wave

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.560
function the
Hamiltonian operator.

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.410
And we integrate that in space.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:07.680
Now, it's actually
simpler than it

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.680
looks because
remember for a moment

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.550
that this psi is actually a
solution of the Schrodinger

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.630
equation.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.060
This psi is a solution of
the stationary Schrodinger

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:18.910
equation.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:22.800
So we know already, because
the Hamiltonian is really--

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.990
remember, it's the
left and term that

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:26.920
is in this stationary equation.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.360
So we know already that,
by the fact of this

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.040
being the solution, applying
this operator to this wave

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.330
function is going to
give me a constant times

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:40.780
this wave function.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:44.940
And so the concept, we
call it nothing else than E

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.590
with a subscript i.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:50.700
So this times the wave function
gives me a constant times

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.960
the wave function itself.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.160
And I can take the constant
out of the integral sine.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:02.970
And I'm left with constant E of
phi times the integral of psi i

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.740
star times Ci.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.660
And that's nothing else than 1.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.550
And so this is, if you
want, the explicit solution

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.760
of why this is epsilon i.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.080
Of course, if you
have never seen this,

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.450
it might look very arcane.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:22.790
And this is why I urge you to
read some introductory quantum

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.620
mechanics textbooks.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:30.530
If you have seen it already, of
course, it might seem trivial.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.030
It might seem trivial to you.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:37.920
OK.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.850
And now, in the next
three or four slides,

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:47.310
we go really into the
two fundamental concepts

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:51.180
of computational
electronic structure.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:55.600
That involves two things.

00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:01.230
One, it involves finding the
solution of the Schrodinger

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:04.440
equation on a computer--
that is, on a system

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.500
that is really not able to
do analysis, if you want,

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.900
is not able to do
analytic derivatives

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.760
and analytic integrals.

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.390
And so we'll how we
actually deal in practice

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.590
with this issue.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:19.560
And then in the
second set of slides,

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.720
we'll give you the
fundamental concept

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.580
that is a reformulation of
the differential equation,

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.360
of the Schrodinger equation,
in a different form that

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.755
is actually computer-friendly
and algorithmic-friendly.

00:56:33.755 --> 00:56:35.130
So we have a
Schrodinger equation

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:37.330
that we know we need to solve.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:40.140
But we can actually
rewrite it in a form

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.060
that is much more convenient.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.780
And respectively,
you can think of them

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.860
as the general concept of
expanding wave function

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:56.100
in a basis that transforms
all our analysis and integrals

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.700
and differentials
in matrix algebra.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.770
And I'll show you in a
moment why that is the case.

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.690
And in the second
part, we'll see

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:06.450
how the Schrodinger
equation is transformed

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:08.790
into a variational principle.

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.340
So really, what you are
seeing now is, I would say,

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:16.240
the central content
of today's class.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:16.740
OK.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.340
Let me first go back to
the Schrodinger equation

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.570
as you have seen it before.

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:25.770
And now, I'm using
actually the shorthand term

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.920
H, this Hamiltonian operator,
that is again nothing

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.080
less than minus H bar
squared over 2m times

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.360
the Laplacian plus
the potential.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.210
And so the Schrodinger
equation tells us

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:39.840
that, for a given potential,
we need to find a wave function

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.680
psi such that when
we apply on it

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.020
those derivatives and
those multiplication

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.200
contained in the
Hamiltonian operator, that

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.130
is H, what we obtain
is nothing else

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:56.820
but the wave function
itself times a constant.

00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:01.020
So this is the Schrodinger
equation in shorthand form.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.830
And we can even be more
compact and write it

00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:09.180
in the bracket formulation
on the right side

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:12.330
as H psi equal to epsilon psi.

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:16.260
So this is our
Schrodinger equation.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.860
And now, this is the
fundamental step.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.440
And this is what
really makes all

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.620
of this solvable on a computer.

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:31.060
What we say now is that
any generic wave function--

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:31.740
OK.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.730
So we are still
considering one electron

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.870
in three dimensional space.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:42.300
So what we have is really an
amplitude field all over space.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.330
Well, that amplitude
field can actually

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:50.610
be written as a
linear combination

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:58.120
of an infinite number of simple
functions times a coefficient.

00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:03.780
So we are saying, well, we can
expand every possible field

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:09.390
into a linear combination
of orthogonal functions

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:13.440
that would be our
basis function.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.470
Say, if you have seen
Fourier analysis,

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.290
you have seen that,
in most cases,

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.990
a well-behaved
function can actually

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:26.370
be expanded as a linear
combination of sines

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:27.780
and cosines.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.330
Or in general, if you have
seen more of analysis,

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:33.210
you have seen that, in a
lot of these Hilbert spaces,

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:38.580
you can define what are
called complete sets

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:40.890
of orthogonal functions.

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:45.370
Sines and cosines are a complete
set of orthogonal functions.

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:48.630
If you take sines or cosines
with different wavelengths

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.550
and you integrate
them over a space,

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.370
you get 0 unless the
wavelength is the same.

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:57.990
And by using an infinite
number of sines and cosines

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:03.030
with different wavelengths,
you can describe any function

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:07.020
that is, in some ways, smooth
enough, that doesn't, say,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.120
infinite discontinuities.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.030
And so what we do
really, in most

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.130
of our computational
application,

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:17.760
is that we define a basis set.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.120
Let's say, for the
case of solids,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.260
it's actually going exactly
to be the basis set of plane

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:31.290
waves, those E to the i kr
with all possible wavelength

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:33.930
and with all
possible directions.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.850
That is an orthogonal set.

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:37.590
And it's complete.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:41.940
And so once we decide
what is our basis set,

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.670
say sines and cosines,
and plane waves--

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:48.450
and there are a lot more that
I'll describe in the following.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:52.950
Well, at that
point, our function

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:58.530
needs to be specified by
a set of coefficients.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.760
And in all practical
implementation,

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.300
we won't use infinite sets.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:06.390
If you have got a
well-behaved function,

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.550
you don't need to describe--

01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:12.810
it probably won't
have oscillation

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.850
with extremely thin wavelength.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:19.470
So you can expand
a wave function

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:22.830
into a combination
of sines and cosines

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:26.580
that have progressively shorter
and shorter wavelengths.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:30.090
But at a certain point, you
can say, well, I'll stop here.

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:35.010
I don't need a resolution
that is thinner than what

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:36.540
is physically reasonable.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.090
I mean, if you are
looking at electrons,

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.400
well, they are going
to have oscillations

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.430
that are of the order of
the inter-atomic distance.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:47.190
But they are not going
to have oscillations

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:51.060
that are of the order, say,
of the diameter of a nucleus.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.320
It just doesn't make
any physical sense.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.410
So you can understand, for
every physical problem at hand,

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:02.970
when you can actually stop
this infinite expansion

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:04.710
in your orthogonal basis.

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:07.800
And at that point,
your wave function

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.900
becomes defined just by a
finite number of coefficients.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.540
And so suppose that
for a moment you

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.090
have only 10 basis functions.

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:23.940
It could be sine of x, sine
of 2x, sine of 3x, sine of 4x,

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.670
up to sine of 10x
in one dimension.

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.360
Well, once you have decided that
those 10 are your good basis

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:36.000
function, your wave function
is described by 10 numbers.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.980
It's just a vector.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.420
And so what you need to do
is find those 10 numbers.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.860
So if you want, what
was an analysis problem

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.730
now becomes a bit of a linear
algebra problem in the ways

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.860
you'll see in a moment,
in which we really need

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.020
to find those 10 coefficients.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.700
We don't need to find
any more integrals

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:02.320
and derivatives of functions.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:10.880
And so let's actually
see how this develops.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.860
Remember, what we need to solve
is the Schrodinger equation

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.900
that I've written over here.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.640
And now, I have decided that
I've got an orthogonal basis.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.400
And I am going to
do some algebra.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.650
In particular, I take this
Schrodinger equation above.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.980
Remember, it's operator
applied on the wave

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.830
function equal to a constant
times the wave function.

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:43.410
And what I do is I say
I multiply this relation

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:51.510
on the left and on the right by
the complex conjugate of phi m.

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:54.330
So in going from here
to here, what I do

01:03:54.330 --> 01:04:00.330
is I multiply this times the
complex conjugate of phi m.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.860
So it's phi m star.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:08.320
And then I integrate
everything over space.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.840
And so you see,
when I take H psi,

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.000
I multiply it by phi m star.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.620
And I integrate.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:18.160
What I obtain is something
that, in shorthand bracket

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.420
formulation, can be
written as phi m H psi

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.610
This is nothing less
than a shorthand

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:30.010
for the integral of overall
space of phi star m times

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:33.640
what results from
applying H to psi.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.160
Same to the right-hand side--

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.810
I multiply E times
by phi m star.

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.970
And I integrate over space.

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:44.990
Now, E is just a constant.

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:47.530
So it can come out
of the integral sine.

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.870
And what I am left
with is the integral

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.690
of phi m star times psi.

01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:56.290
And again, it's very important
that you go back just

01:04:56.290 --> 01:05:00.040
after this class and
you rewrite explicitly

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.100
all these algebraic terms
to make sure that you

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.490
become comfortable with them.

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:08.440
So I've done this operation.

01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:15.700
This is what I have obtained.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.970
And now, what I do I
exploit my hypothesis.

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:24.460
I've said that my
wave function can

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:29.030
be written as a linear
combination of my basis

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:32.090
function with
certain coefficients.

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:36.910
So in this integral,
now I substitute for psi

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:41.660
at sum of wave function with
appropriate coefficients.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:45.310
And as usual, I can take
the sum and the coefficient

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.410
out of the integral sine.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:51.100
So what I'm left with
is a sum of the Cn that

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:56.920
multiplies the integral of
phi star m H phi star n.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.850
This is what I have
on the left-hand side.

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:07.480
And now, on the right-hand side,
this is likely trickier to see.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.440
Again, I'm substituting
for psi that sum.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.310
So what I obtain
here is really--

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:18.130
let me write it as an
integral for a moment--

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:27.000
is the integral over all
space of phi m star times

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.260
the sum over n of Cn phi m.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.851
I can take a--

01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:41.100
sorry, it's a sum over--

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.270
it's a bit difficult to see.

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.970
Let me write it more clearly.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:56.550
It's a sum over n Cn phi star n.

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:58.440
OK.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.790
These are just coefficients.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:02.320
I can take them out
of the integral sine.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.290
So what I'm left with
is sum over n Cn times

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:15.810
the integral over the r
of phi n star times phi m.

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.030
For some reason, I
wrote this down here.

01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:21.450
So it's just a phi n.

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:25.380
And now, the integral
of dr phi m star

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:31.350
times phi n is going to be
equal either to 1 or to 0,

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:35.340
depending if m is equal to
Min or m is different from n

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:39.630
because, in our hypothesis,
we have said that these basis

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.220
functions are orthogonal.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:45.630
And that orthogonal means we
take the integral of them.

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.520
If they are
identical, it gives 1.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.130
If they are
different, it gives 0.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:53.220
So in all the sum
over the n, there

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:57.250
is only one index that
will be identical to this.

01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:00.450
So for that case,
the integral gives 1.

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:02.100
Otherwise, it gives 0.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.550
So what is saved
in all of this is

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:08.460
only the coefficient
that corresponds

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.450
to this m coefficient here.

01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:14.640
So what we obtain from this
is the Cm times a constant.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.570
OK.

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:19.680
So again, I've rewritten
the Schrodinger equation

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.970
by multiplying it by phi
m star, integrating it.

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:27.270
And what I obtain
is a new formulation

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:33.840
of the Schrodinger equation that
I have also in the next slide.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.580
And that we are actually
going to analyze.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:50.950
So this is nothing else
than your last slide.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:56.890
And again, what we need to
find are these coefficiencies.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:09:01.180
Those have become
now our solution.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:06.279
And we can actually write
this explicitly using

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:07.450
a bit of nomenclature.

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:11.979
That is, we can call that
scalar, that expectation

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:12.899
value--

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:19.029
phi m H phi n, we can call
it that shorthand H m n.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.520
We call it actually
the matrix element

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:27.250
of the Hamiltonian over the
two basis phi m and phi n.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:33.310
And so again, our
Schrodinger equation

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:37.899
has been rewritten in
compact form as this.

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:41.410
That is, the physical
problem tells

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:44.970
us what is the potential
that the electron feels.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:49.590
The potential specifies what
the Hamiltonian operator

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:52.620
H is because it's,
again, just the Laplacian

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.520
plus the potential.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.440
And so once we have
decided our basis set

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.500
onto which we develop
our wave function, what

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.550
we need to calculate are
all these matrix elements.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:09.030
Now, these H m n are
explicit numbers.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.430
Once my potential
is well-defined,

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:17.100
once my bases sector is defined,
those H are just numbers.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.550
And they actually can be
written out in a matrix.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.940
And my Schrodinger equation has
been rewritten in this form.

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:32.040
That is, I have that this matrix
times the vector of coefficient

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.130
of my expansion needs
to be equal to a number

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:39.460
times the same vector.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.110
And if you want, I have
two things to find out.

01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:48.090
I need to find out what
are the values of E

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:53.880
for which this linear algebra
system is a solution at all.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.780
And we know from linear
algebra that there

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:02.100
aren't an infinite
number of values of E

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.000
for which this system
has a solution.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.400
And I'll comment in
that on a moment.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.450
And once we have found
those values of E

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:13.170
for which there is a solution,
we need to find the solution.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:16.560
That is, we need to
find this vector.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.950
And so again, our
problem is matrix times

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:24.270
vector needs to be equal
to a constant times vector.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:27.090
And we actually-- again,
I don't have the time

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:28.770
to go into linear algebra.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:35.280
But we know this can actually
be rewritten as a Hamiltonian

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:42.510
matrix, an H matrix minus an
E on all the diagonal terms

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.940
times this vector equal to 0.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.700
And we know that this
linear algebra solution--

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.700
this linear algebra
problem has a solution

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:58.860
only for values of E such that
the determinant of the matrix H

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:02.400
minus E times the identity is 0.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.670
So our goal is first finding
those values of E for which

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.320
this determinant is 0.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.770
And we call those eigenvalues,
are the only values

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:18.670
of the energy that are allowed
in our quantized Schrodinger

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:19.450
equation.

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:23.220
And then for each of
these eigenvalues, E,

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.260
there is going to be a vector.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.310
There is going to be a set
of coefficient from C1 and Ck

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.880
that satisfies this
linear algebra problem.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.430
And we call that specific vector
of coefficients an eigenvector.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.980
So this is an
eigenvalue equation

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.410
that only certain
values of phi which

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.270
this equation is a solution.

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:49.830
And those values of phi
for which it has a solution

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:52.500
will give rise to
the eigenvector

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.900
that satisfies this equation.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.600
And in a computer, you see the
only thing that we need to do

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.860
is calculate this matrix
element of the Hamiltonian,

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.910
find its eigenvalue, and
find its eigenvectors that

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:09.780
are all well-defined
linear algebra problems.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:14.190
And so this is the first
fundamental conclusion.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:18.630
We can always rewrite our
quantum mechanical problem

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:22.950
into a linear algebra
problem once we specify

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.470
a basis set for our function.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:27.510
And depending on
the problem at hand,

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:30.630
we can choose basis sets that
are more appropriate or less

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:31.560
appropriate.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.350
If we are studying, say,
electrons in a metal

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:37.180
that would look like
free electron-like,

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.440
a basis set of plane waves
with different wavelengths

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.910
is a very good choice.

01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:45.240
If we are studying solutions,
say, in a molecule,

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.110
maybe a basis set in which
each state looks more

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.600
like atomic orbitals would
be a more appropriate choice.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.100
And again, we'll see
this in the next classes.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:01.510
But now, the problem has become
a linear algebra problem.

01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:06.640
And there is another conceptual
and last step for today's class

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.650
that I want to highlight.

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:13.360
That is very powerful
because, especially when

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.340
we move from trying to find the
solution for a single electron

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.750
to finding the solution for
many interacting electrons,

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.510
it will give us a
systematic handle

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:30.010
to move in a problem
that becomes conceptually

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.250
more and more complex.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:34.720
We have discussed how there is
this exponentially exploding

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.460
complexity.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:41.950
And there is what is called
a variational principle.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.530
That is nothing else
but reformulation

01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:46.570
of the Schrodinger equation.

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:47.920
And what is this?

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.530
Well, what I am
saying is that there

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:56.410
is what we call a functional
of any arbitrary function.

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.670
What is a functional?

01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:01.600
Well, it's something
that, given a function,

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.730
operates on that function
and produces a number.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:10.350
So we call our
functional E of phi.

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:15.090
It's an algorithm that
eats as input a function

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.970
and gives as output a number.

01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:20.670
And the explicitly
definition of this algorithm

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:24.100
is given here on
the right-hand side.

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.030
And what is it?

01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:28.380
Well, for any arbitrary
function, what we need

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.770
is to calculate the expectation
value of the Hamiltonian.

01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:35.430
So we need to calculate
again the integral

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:41.940
over space of phi star times
the Hamiltonian operator applied

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.200
onto phi.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:50.440
And we divide that this by the
integral of phi star times phi.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:50.940
OK.

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.620
This is an operative definition.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:53.970
I gave you a function.

01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:57.490
What you obtain back by
calculating this integral

01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:00.060
and taking the
ratio is a number.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:04.740
But now, the important
thing is, what can we prove?

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:09.630
Well, we can prove this
fundamental theorem that tells

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.210
us, for a given
Hamiltonian-- that is,

01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:14.280
for a given potential--

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.770
you can throw into this
functional any arbitrary

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.000
function.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.430
You can try to calculate
this ratio for any phi.

01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:29.220
And what you'll find
is that the number

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:32.880
that you obtain for any
phi that you throw in

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.970
is going to be always greater
or equal than the ground state

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:41.130
energy of your electron.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:44.490
Not only that, but in
particular this number

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:47.700
is equal to the ground state
energy of your electron,

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.030
the function that you have used
is really the ground state wave

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:53.640
function, is the wave
function corresponding

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.220
to the lowest energy of
the Schrodinger equation.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:01.410
And so you see this gives
us a sort of trial and error

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:07.530
practical recipe to try and find
out what is the ground state

01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:11.730
energy of an electron in
very complex potential

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:14.190
because the only thing
that we have to do

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.970
is try a lot of wave functions.

01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:22.080
And what we will
obtain as our best

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.940
guess is the wave function that
has the minimum expectation

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.050
value.

01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:31.320
It will never be
an exact solution,

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.650
unless we examine
all the possible wave

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.390
functions in the world.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:39.810
But it's a solution that
becomes better and better

01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:42.060
the more systematic we become.

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.450
The more wave functions
we try, the better

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:47.460
our solution will
be, the closer it

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.990
will be to the
ground state energy.

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:53.200
And I think I'll leave
it as an exercise--

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.900
and this is my last slide--

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.760
to be proven by
you for next time.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.800
And that is, I'm asking you
to go back and try to prove

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.870
this variational principle.

01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:07.680
And the only operation
that you really need to do

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:11.490
is, again, expand
your wave function phi

01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:16.710
into a linear
combination now of states

01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:21.240
that I can call chi
of n that are actually

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.120
the eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.880
That is, we have a well-defined
Hamiltonian operator.

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.050
So in principle,
at least formally,

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:34.980
we know that it will
have a set of solutions

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:40.710
that we write as H applied
to this eigenfunction

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:47.220
is going to be a number times
the eigenfunction itself.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:51.630
And the set of solutions
of a Hamiltonian

01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:56.400
are actually in themselves
a complete orthonormal set.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.890
So we use that
complete orthonormal

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:05.550
set to expand our wave function
as a linear combination

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:07.710
of these eigenvectors.

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:13.130
And with this ansatz,
wave function expanded

01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:15.920
in a combination
of eigenfunctions

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.270
of the Hamiltonian, you can
go back and prove by yourself

01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.720
the variational principle
in the previous slide.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.110
And that, again, is probably
the most powerful principle

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:32.900
that we have to develop
all the many-body solutions

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.360
to the electronic
structure problem.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.290
And we'll see that in
next class on Thursday.

01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:42.140
And again, all of
this, if you have never

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.620
seen quantum mechanics,
might seem very Arcane.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.620
So either read some
of the readings

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:50.810
that I have given you
or just come and see me.

01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:53.500
Fix up an appointment.

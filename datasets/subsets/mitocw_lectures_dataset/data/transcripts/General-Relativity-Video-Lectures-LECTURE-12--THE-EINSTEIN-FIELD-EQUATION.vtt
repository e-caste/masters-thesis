SCOTT HUGHES: All right.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.420
Good morning, 8.962.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.340
This is a very weird experience.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.210
I am standing in here talking
to an empty classroom.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.670
I have some experience
talking to myself,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.180
because like many of us, I
am probably a little weirder

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.130
than the average.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.600
But that does not
change the fact

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.470
that this is awkward
and a little strange,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.860
and we already miss
having you around here.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.820
So I hope we all get through
MIT's current weirdness

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.600
in a healthy and quick
fashion so we can get back

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.590
to doing this work we
love with the people we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.970
love to have here.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.360
All right, so all
that being said,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.020
it's time for us to get back
to the business of 8.962, which

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.820
is learning about
general relativity.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.400
And today, the lecture
that I am recording

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.920
is one in which we will
take all the tools that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.840
have been developed
and we will turn this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.610
into a theory of gravity.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.460
Let me go over a quick
recap of some of the things

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.630
that we talked about in
our previous lecture,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.215
and I want to emphasize
this because this quantity

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.840
that we derived about
two lectures ago,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.330
the Riemann curvature
tensor, is going

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.540
to play an extremely
important role in things

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.290
that we do moving forward.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.170
So I'll just quickly remind you
that in our previous lecture,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.910
we counted up the symmetries
that this tensor has.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.740
And so the four most--

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.880
the four that are important for
understanding its properties,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.900
its four main symmetries
are first of all,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.970
if you exchange indices 3 and 4,
it comes in with a minus sign,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.220
so it's anti-symmetric under
exchange of indices 3 and 4.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.900
If you lower that
first and next so

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.330
that they are all in
the downstairs position

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.820
and you exchange
indices 1 and 2,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.772
you likewise pick
up a minus sign.

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:06.980
Again, keeping everything
in the downstairs position,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.070
if you just wholesale
swap indices 1 and 2

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.232
for indices 3 and 4 like
so, that's symmetric,

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.440
and so you get the whole
thing back with a plus sign.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.482
And finally, one that's a little
bit non-obvious but can be seen

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.940
if you're sort of pigheaded
enough to sort of stare at this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.990
thing and kind of pound on
the algebra a little bit,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.572
if you take the Riemann
curvature tensor--

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:38.530
and this can be at the
end of-- the first index

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.430
can be either upstairs
or downstairs,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.450
but if you cyclically
permute indices 2, 3, and 4

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.480
and add them up,
they sum to 0, OK?

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.300
So that tells you that it's a
constraint on this thing when

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.258
I look at the behavior,
this thing with respect

00:02:52.258 --> 00:02:54.530
to indices 2, 3, and 4.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.530
We introduced a variant of
the Riemann curvature tensor

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.360
called the Ricci curvature.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.720
So the way I do this is if I
take the trace on the Riemann

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.628
curvature tensor on
indices 1 and 3, which

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:08.420
is equivalent to taking
it with the indices

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.795
on the downstairs position
and hitting it with the metric

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:16.100
like so, I get this quantity,
which I forgot to write down,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.552
is symmetric.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.820
One of the major important
physical applications

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.350
of the Riemann
curvature tensor is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.020
that it allows us to
describe the way in which two

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.740
neighboring geodesics-- if
I have two geodesics that

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.310
are separated by
a four vector c,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.000
and I look at how that
separation evolves as they move

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.810
forward along their geodesic
paths, this differential

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.460
equation describes
how it behaves.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.290
And the key thing
is that what we see

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.670
is that the rate of separation
is proportional to the Riemann

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.570
curvature.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.430
It ends up playing
the role-- when

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.360
we think about-- what this tells
us is this ends up, remember,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.610
geodesics describe free fall.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.270
And so what this is telling me
is a way in which two nearby

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.960
but somewhat separated--
separated by a distance c--

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.450
nearby but slightly
separated geodesics-- both

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.630
are in free fall, but their
free fall trajectories

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.490
are diverging from
one other and perhaps

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.900
being focused
towards one another

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.110
depending upon how R
is actually behaving,

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.810
this is the behavior of tides.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.860
Free fall is
gravity, and this is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.050
saying that the free
fall trajectory's

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.920
change of separation is
governed by the Riemann tensor,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.220
and that's telling me about the
action of gravitational tides.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.390
The last thing that we did
in Tuesday's-- excuse me--

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.690
in Thursday's lecture was I went
through and I developed this

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.180
proof of what is known
as the Bianchi identity,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.260
which is an identity on the--

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.270
it's an identity on the
covariant derivative

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.630
of the Riemann tensor.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.120
And so notice what's
going on here.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.360
I'm leaving indices 3 and
4 on the Riemann tensor--

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.160
oh shoot.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.620
I'm actually changing my
notation halfway through,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.020
let me fix that.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.052
My apologies.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.640
OK.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.660
Apologies for that.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.690
Are you leave indices 3 and
4 unchanged, and what you do

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.538
is you cyclically permute
the index against--

00:05:16.538 --> 00:05:18.580
in the direction which
you're taking a derivative

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.940
with indices 1 and 2.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.190
So my first term, it goes alpha,
beta, gamma; then beta, gamma,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.962
alpha; gamma, alpha, beta.

00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:28.420
OK, notice the way they are
cyclically permuting like that.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.680
Sum them up and you get 0.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.120
So let's take it from here.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.540
We're going to start with
this Bianchi identity.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.610
What I want to do now is
contract the Bianchi identity

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.490
in the following way.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.090
So let's take this form
that I've written out here--

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.160
and let me just make sure I've
left it now in a form that

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.180
comports with my notes.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.050
I did, good.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.980
So what I'm going to do is
multiply the entire thing.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.620
Using the metric, I'm
going to contract it

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.190
on indices beta and mu.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.320
So remember, the metric commutes
with the covariant derivative.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.140
So unless the derivative
itself is with respect

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.000
to either the beta
or the mu index,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.640
that g just sort of waltzes
right in top of there.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.090
So when I do this,
it's going to beta--

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.280
g beta mu nu upstairs is going
to walk right through this,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.800
it's going to raise
the beta index,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.670
and what I wind up with
here is this first term

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.170
becomes the covariant derivative
of the Ricci tensor, OK?

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.710
I have contracted on
indices beta and mu.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.570
When it hits this
one, is just going

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.910
to raise the index on
that covariant derivative.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.910
So I've got a term here
now that looks something

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.940
like the divergence of the
Riemann tensor, divergence

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.110
with respect to index 3.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.640
When I hit this term,
it walks through

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.810
the covariant derivative
again, and you

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.220
see what I'm doing is a
trace on indexes 2 and 3.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.700
Now I can take advantage
of the anti-symmetry

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.290
here-- let's reverse this.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.790
And so it's like doing a--

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.920
throwing in a minus
sign and then doing

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.270
a trace on indices 1 and 2--

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.080
excuse me, doing a trace on--

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.370
rewind, back up
for just a second.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.970
I'm going to take advantage
that anti-symmetry, I'll

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.630
exchange indices 1
and 2, and then I

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.600
am doing a trace on indices
1 and 3, which is going

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.250
to give me the Ricci tensor.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.170
But because I have used that--

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.600
or that anti-symmetry, I
will do so with a minus sign.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.900
So what I get here is this.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.380
I'm going to probably bobble
more than once in this lecture,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.130
because again, doing this in an
empty room is a little weird.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.130
All right.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.450
So I really want to get a
relationship that simplifies

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.525
the Riemann tensor, OK?

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:17.430
A Riemann tensor's got
four indices on it.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.610
I'm not scared, but
I don't like it, OK?

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.100
So we're going to do one
more contraction operation

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.150
to try to simplify this.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:39.039
Let's now contract once
more using the metric

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.240
on indices g and nu, OK?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.060
So when I do it with the first
one, it walks right through--

00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:52.560
right through that
covariant derivative,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.285
and I get the trace of the
Riemann tensor, the Ricci--

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.285
excuse me-- I get the
trace of the Ricci tensor,

00:08:57.285 --> 00:09:00.290
the Ricci scalar.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.260
When I do it on the
second term, OK?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.190
I am now tracing
on indices 1 and 4.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.230
I will invoke anti-symmetry
to change that

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:21.280
into a trace on indices 1 in
3, and I get the Ricci tenser

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.030
with a minus sign.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.080
And then the next one,
I just trace on this

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.810
and I wind up with something
that looks like this.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.310
OK.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.830
Now these two terms are
both divergences on the--

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.520
they are both divergences
on the second index.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.570
The second index
is a dummy index,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.760
so I can put these two together.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.220
So this is equivalent to--

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.510
or dividing out a
factor of minus 2,

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.070
the way this is
more often written.

00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:11.358
You can also factor
out that derivative.

00:10:11.358 --> 00:10:12.400
Let's write it like this.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.570
OK?

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.450
So what I'm doing here
is I divided by a minus 2

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.240
so that I can put this guy in
front and I get a minus 1/2

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.545
in front of my Ricci term.

00:10:32.545 --> 00:10:34.920
And because I want to factor
out my covariant derivative,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.628
I need to throw in a
factor of the metric

00:10:36.628 --> 00:10:38.760
there so that the
indices line up right.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.622
So what we do at this point is
we do what-- whenever you reach

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:43.080
a certain point in
your calculation

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.110
where you've got something good,
you do what every mathematician

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.260
or physicist would do,
you give this guy a name.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:58.310
So switching my
indices a tiny bit,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:06.070
we define g mu nu to be
the Ricci tensor minus 1/2

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.730
metric Ricci scalar,
and this is an entity

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.190
known as the Einstein tensor.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.840
This is a course on
Einstein's gravity,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.590
so the name alone
should tell you,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.510
this guy is going to matter.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.760
One quick side note.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.658
So suppose I take the trace
of the Einstein tensor.

00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:39.450
When we took the trace
of the Ricci tensor,

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.867
I didn't write it down, but
if I take a trace of this guy,

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:45.450
I just get the Ricci scalar
R, which I used over here.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.580
So when I do this here--

00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:49.961
oops.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.390
Suppose I just want to call
this the Einstein scalar g.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.650
Well, applying that
to its definition,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:12.845
this is going to be equal to
the Ricci scalar minus 1/2 trace

00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:16.760
of the metric times R.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.870
And it's a general rule
in any theory of spacetime

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.450
that the trace of the metric
is equal to the number

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.340
of dimensions in
your spacetime, OK?

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.720
You can easily work it
out in special relativity,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.350
you're basically just raising
one index, and as we'll see,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.600
it holds completely generally.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.700
In fact, it follows
directly from the fact

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.270
that the upstairs metric
is the matrix inverse

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.400
of the downstairs metric.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.690
So this is equal to
4, so this whole thing

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.980
is just the negative
of the Ricci scalar.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.190
What this means is
that the Einstein

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:13.083
tensor is the trace-reversed
Ricci tensor, OK?

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.500
I just want to
plant that for now.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.542
This is a fact that we're
going to take advantage

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:19.990
of a little bit later,
but for now, it's

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.980
just a mathematical fact
that I want to point out,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.950
I want to set aside.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.070
We'll come back to
it when it matters.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.980
OK.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.560
We now have everything
that we need

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.100
to take all of the
framework that we

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.870
have been developing
all term and turn it

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.272
into a theory of gravity.

00:13:45.272 --> 00:13:46.230
I just had a nightmare.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.900
Am I being recorded?-- yes, OK.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.025
Sorry, just suddenly thought
I might have forgotten

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:51.620
to turn my microphone on!

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.940
So let's turn this into
a theory of gravity.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.380
Ingredient 1 is something that
we have discussed quite a bit

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.340
before.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.950
I want to restate it and I
want to sort of remind us.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.750
Several times over
the past couple of

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.140
lectures I have implicitly
used this rule already,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.920
but I want to make it a
little bit more explicit now.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.011
We're going to use the
principle of equivalence.

00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:44.310
In particular,
we're going to use

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:50.736
what is known as the
minimal coupling principle.

00:14:56.633 --> 00:14:58.550
So here's the way-- what
this basically means.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.260
We're going to try to take
laws of physics that are

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.080
well-understood from
laboratory experiments,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.740
from special relativity,
everything that we have known

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.690
and loved and tested for--

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.430
since we started
studying physics,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.520
and we're going to try to see
how that can be carried over

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.730
to working in the curved
spacetime that will describe

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.350
gravity with as little
additional sort of coupling

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.200
to spacetime entities
as is possible.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.290
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:40.670
Take a law of physics that is
valid in inertial coordinates

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:54.410
and flat spacetime, or
equivalently, the local Lorentz

00:15:54.410 --> 00:16:01.910
frame, which corresponds
to the local region

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:34.910
of a freely-falling frame or
a freely-falling observer,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.470
take that law of physics
that is good in that form

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:47.480
and rewrite it in a
coordinate-invariant tensorial

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:47.980
form.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.460
This is one the reasons
why throughout this term,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:14.569
we have been brutally didactic
about insisting on getting all

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.950
of our laws of physics expressed
using tensors, quantities which

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.200
have exactly the
transformation laws

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.619
that we demand in order for
them to be true tensors that

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.407
live in the curve manifold that
we use to describe spacetime.

00:17:28.407 --> 00:17:29.990
The last time I
actually did something

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.615
like this was when I derived--

00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:33.740
I've erased it now, but
when I derived the equation

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.180
of geodesic deviation, OK?

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.612
I first did it using very,
very simple language,

00:17:37.612 --> 00:17:39.320
and then I sort of
looked at it and said,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.350
well this is fine according
to that local Lorentz frame,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.630
according to that
freely-falling observer.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.000
But this is not
tensorial, it's actually

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.682
as written only
good in that frame.

00:17:49.682 --> 00:17:51.890
And so what we did was we
took another couple minutes

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.710
and said, let's see how I
can change this acceleration

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.900
operator that describes my
equation of geodesic deviation,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.570
put in the extra
structure necessary so

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.080
that the acceleration
operator is tensorial,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.040
and when we did that, we saw
that the result was actually

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.640
exactly what the Riemann tensor
looks like in the local Lorentz

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.140
frame.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.380
We said, if it holds
a local Lorentz frame,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.760
I'm going to assert it
holds in all other frames.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.780
And that indeed is the final
step in this procedure.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:34.954
We assert that the resulting
law holds in curved spacetime.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.240
OK?

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.990
So this is the procedure
by which general relativity

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.840
takes the laws of physics,
good and flat spacetime,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.340
and rejiggers them so that
they work in curved spacetime.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.150
Ultimately, this is
physics, and so ultimately

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.880
the test for these
things are experiments.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.890
And I will simply
say at this point

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.920
that this procedure has
passed all experimental tests

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.440
that we have thrown
at it so far,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.022
and so we're happy with it.

00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:15.480
So let me just
describe one example

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.063
of where we did this-- actually,
I'm going to do two examples.

00:19:18.063 --> 00:19:26.020
So if I consider the
force-free motion of an object

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.170
in the freely-falling frame--

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.850
so recall, in the
freely-falling frame,

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.730
everything is being acted upon
by gravity in an equal way.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.070
If I am in the
local Lorentz frame,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.360
I can simply say that
my object feels--

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.450
my freely-falling object,
freely-flying observer--

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.760
feels no acceleration.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.540
That is a perfectly rigorous
expression of the idea

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.200
that this observer or object
is undergoing force-free motion

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.730
in this frame.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.131
This is not tensorial, though.

00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:25.310
And so we look at
this and say, well,

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.490
if I want to make this
tensorial, what I'm going to do

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:33.985
is note that the tensor
operator that describes-- now

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:36.050
let me keep my indices
consistent here.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:43.010
My tensor operator that
describes this equation

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:53.720
is given by taking the covariant
derivative of the four velocity

00:20:53.720 --> 00:21:00.050
and contracting it with
the four velocity itself.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.880
These say the exact same thing
in the local Lorentz frame.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.320
This one is tensorial,
though, that one is not.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.210
And so we then
say, OK, well this

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.130
is the version
that is tensorial,

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.120
I'm going to assert that
it holds in general.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:21.610
Another example in flat
spacetime, local conservation

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:29.630
of energy and momentum
was expressed by the idea

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:39.460
that my stress energy
tensor had no divergence

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.300
in the local Lorentz frame.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.730
Well, if I want to
make this tensorial,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.060
all I do is I promote that
partial derivative I used

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.973
to define the divergence
to a covariant derivative.

00:21:55.028 --> 00:21:57.070
This is how we are going
to define conservation--

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.770
we're going to define local
conservation of energy

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.680
and momentum in a
general spacetime theory.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.690
So that's step 1.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.550
We need-- or sorry,
ingredient 1.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:34.700
Ingredient 2 is-- well, let's
just step back for a second.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:39.520
We have done a lot of work
to describe the behavior

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.818
of curved spacetimes, OK?

00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:42.610
Spacetimes that are
not just the spacetimes

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.830
of special
relativity, spacetimes

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.910
when my basis objects are
functional, where the Riemann

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.110
curvature tensor is non-zero.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.750
We've done a lot to do that,
but I haven't said anything

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.020
about where that curved
spacetime actually comes from.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:07.780
So the next thing which I
need is a field equation

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:25.150
which connects my spacetime to
sources of matter and energy.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.368
That's a tall order.

00:23:35.368 --> 00:23:36.910
The way we're going
to do this, we're

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.050
actually going to do
it two different ways.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.710
So in this current
lecture, I'm going

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.290
to do it using a
method that parallels

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.115
how Einstein originally
did it when he derived--

00:23:47.115 --> 00:23:48.490
what resulted out
of this is what

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.490
we call the field equation
of general relativity

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.460
or the Einstein field equation,
and in this first presentation

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.150
of this material, I'm going to
do it the way Einstein did it.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:07.000
So what we are going to do is
we will require that whatever

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:17.670
emerges from this procedure, it
must recover Newtonian gravity

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.070
in an appropriate limit.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.740
This is a philosophical
point about physics.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.540
When you come up
with a new theory,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.880
you may conceptually
overturn what came before.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.140
You may have an entirely new
way of thinking about it.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.130
You may go from saying that
there is a potential that

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.660
is sourced by mass
that fills all of space

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.650
and that objects react to
to saying something like,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.280
we now decide that
the manifold of events

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.470
has a curvature
that is determined

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.010
by the distribution of matter
and energy in spacetime.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.690
It's very different
philosophical and ultimately

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.790
mathematical ways
of formulating this,

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.460
but they have to give
consistent predictions,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.070
because at the end of the
day, Newtonian gravity

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.200
works pretty damn well, OK?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.570
We can't just throw that away.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.440
So what we're going
to do is demand

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.630
that in an appropriate limit,
both the field equation

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.580
for Newtonian gravity--

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:31.430
so this is the
Laplace operator now,

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:37.190
which I'm going to write in a
semi-coordinate-invariant form,

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.760
as the chronic or delta
contracted-- basically

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.310
it's the trace on a matrix
of partial derivatives acting

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.170
on a potential.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:51.710
This equals 4 pi rho, and I call
this semi-coordinate invariant

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.230
because part of
what goes into this

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.100
is this Newtonian limit
only works if everything

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.300
is sufficiently slowly
varying in time,

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.520
that things having to
do with time derivatives

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.290
can be neglected, OK?

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.490
It's never really been--

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.250
prior to some of the more
modern experiments that we've

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.830
had to do, time-varying
sources of gravity

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.600
are very hard to work with.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.570
And so Newton was never
really tested in that way.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:23.890
Nonetheless, whatever
emerges from Einstein

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.670
had best agree with this.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:39.420
And we are also going to require
that the equation of motion

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.572
in this framework agree
with Newtonian gravity.

00:26:43.572 --> 00:26:45.780
We actually went through
this-- this was a little bit

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.950
of a preview of this
lecture, we did this in our--

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.320
we concluded our
discussion of geodesics.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.900
Let me just recap the result
that came out of this.

00:27:03.145 --> 00:27:06.370
So our equation of
motion was that--

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:18.420
you can write it as the
acceleration of an observer

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:27.277
is related to the
gradient of the potential.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.660
All right.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.812
So let's follow in the footsteps
of Einstein and do this.

00:27:35.812 --> 00:27:38.270
So what we're going to do--
let's do the equation of motion

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:38.600
first.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.320
I've already gone
through this briefly,

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.820
but I want to go
over it again and I

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.460
want to update the
notation slightly.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.790
So let's do the
equation of motion

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.150
by beginning with the
geodesic equation.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:10.220
We will start with
the acceleration

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:21.220
coupled to the four velocity
by the Christoffel symbols.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.040
All tests of Newtonian
gravity, especially

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.983
those that Einstein had
available at the time

00:28:28.983 --> 00:28:31.150
that he was formulating
this, were slow motion ones.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.790
We were considering
objects moving

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.100
at best in our solar system.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.250
And so things there on a human
scale certainly move quickly,

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.140
but they're slow compared
to the speed of light.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:49.260
And so let's impose the slow
motion limit, which tells us

00:28:49.260 --> 00:29:03.370
that the 0th component
of the four velocity

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.080
is much larger than the
spatial components of the four

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.377
velocity, OK?

00:29:07.377 --> 00:29:09.460
Remember working in units
where the speed of light

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.600
is equal to 1.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.455
And so if this is being measured
in human units, kilometers

00:29:13.455 --> 00:29:14.830
per second, and
things like that,

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.710
this is on the order
of the speed of light.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.280
So when we throw this in, we
see that we expand this out,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.980
that the contributions
from the dt

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.280
d tau terms here are going to be
vastly larger than any others.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.260
And so we can
simplify our equation

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:54.930
to a form that looks like this.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.090
OK?

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:09.300
In the spirit of
being uber complete,

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.270
let's write out that
Christoffel symbol.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.795
So dig back into your
previous lectures' notes,

00:30:31.795 --> 00:30:34.420
remind yourself what the formula
for the Christoffel symbol is.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.140
OK.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.330
Notice, two of the terms
here are time derivatives.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.220
The Newtonian limit-- all
the tests that were available

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.680
when Einstein was formulating
this, the limit that we care

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.797
about here, the
gravitational field,

00:31:07.797 --> 00:31:09.880
the gravitational potentials
that he was studying,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.360
what the Newtonian limit
emerges from, they are static.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:19.160
So we're going to do is neglect
time derivatives to recover

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.660
this limit.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:42.710
And when we do this, what we
find is that the component--

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.110
the Christoffel
component that we

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.170
care about looks like
one derivative of the 0 0

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.710
piece of the spacetime metric.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.950
It's not too hard
to convince yourself

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:03.050
that this, in fact, reduces--

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.502
oops, pardon me.

00:32:08.502 --> 00:32:09.210
I skipped a step.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.320
Pardon me just one moment.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.590
Just one moment, my apologies.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.610
I'm going to write
the spacetime metric--

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.730
I'm going to work in a
coordinate system such

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:26.840
that spacetime looks
like the flat space

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.880
time of special relativity
plus a little bit else, OK?

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.430
This is consistent with
the idea that every system

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.370
we have studied in
Newtonian gravity

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.590
is one where the predictions
of special relativity

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.600
actually work really,
really well, OK?

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.340
Gravity is new,
it's special, it's

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.290
why we have a whole other
course describing it.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.860
But clearly it can't
be too far different

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.530
from special relativity
or we wouldn't

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.447
have been able to formulate
special relativity

00:32:51.447 --> 00:32:52.250
in the first place.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.610
So my apologies, I sort of
jumped ahead here for a second.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.220
We're going to treat
the g mu nu that

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.330
goes into this as the metric of
flat spacetime plus something

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.850
else where I'm going
to imagine that all

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.520
the different
components of this--

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.760
so a typical component
of this h mu nu

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.190
has an absolute value that
is much smaller than 1.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:24.770
It's not too hard to prove that
when you invert this, what you

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.880
wind up with is a form that
looks like so where this h mu

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:38.530
nu with the indices in
the upstairs position

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:42.040
is given by raising
h's indices using

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.313
the metric of flat spacetime.

00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:45.730
We're going to talk about this
in a little bit more detail

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.740
in a future lecture,
it doesn't really

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.020
matter too much right now.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.460
I just want to point out
that the inverse g, which

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.220
we need to use here,
also has this form that

00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:00.300
looks like flat spacetime metric
and this h coupling into it.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.020
Now the reason I'm
going through all this

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.420
is that in order to work
out this Christoffel symbol,

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.489
I need to take a derivative.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:12.179
The derivative of eta is 0, OK?

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.880
So the only thing that
gets differentiated is h.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:44.570
So when you work out
this Christoffel symbol,

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.139
what you get is this.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:50.449
If you're being-- keeping
score, there are corrections

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.719
of order h squared,
and pardon me,

00:34:53.719 --> 00:35:00.140
I should have
actually noted, there

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.820
are corrections
of order h squared

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.003
that go into this inverse.

00:35:04.003 --> 00:35:05.420
Let me move this
over so I can fit

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.587
that in a little bit better.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.050
But in keeping with
the idea that--

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.810
in keeping with the idea
that for the Newtonian limit,

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.533
the h squared could--

00:35:24.533 --> 00:35:26.950
h is small, we're going to
treat the h squared corrections

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.570
as negligible and
we will drop them.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.230
OK.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.740
So let's look at what motion
in this limit turns into, then.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.757
We now have enough pieces
to compute all the bits

00:35:41.757 --> 00:35:42.840
of the equation of motion.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.510
So in keeping with the idea that
I am going to neglect all time

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.970
derivatives, this tells
me that the gamma 0,

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:58.710
00 term is equal to 0.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:12.330
And from this, we find that
there is a simple equation

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.170
describing time.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:32.810
In our equation
describing space, OK?

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:38.050
So what I've done there is just
taken this geodesic equation,

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:42.320
plugged in that result for
the Christoffel symbol,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.660
and expanded this guy out.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:10.270
So what results, I can
divide both sides now

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.835
by two powers of dt d tau.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:26.920
All right.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.230
If you take a look at
what we've got here,

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.380
this prediction of the--
no even a prediction, this

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.690
result from the
geodesic equation

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.860
is identical to our
Newtonian equation of motion

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.593
provided we make the
following identification.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:04.040
h00 must be minus
2 phi where phi

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.800
was Newtonian
gravitational potential.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:24.070
Or equivalently, g00 is the
negative of 1 plus 2 phi.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:24.570
All right.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.670
So that's step 1.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:33.140
We have made for
ourselves a correspondence

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:40.295
between what the metric should
be and the equation of motion.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.408
We still have to do
the field equation,

00:38:46.408 --> 00:38:47.450
so let's talk about that.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.520
So very helpfully I've already
got the Newtonian field

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.728
equation right above me here.

00:39:14.728 --> 00:39:20.975
Let me rewrite it
because I'm going

00:39:20.975 --> 00:39:23.533
to want to tweak my
notation a tiny bit.

00:39:23.533 --> 00:39:25.700
I don't want to think about
what this is telling me.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:37.683
So eta ij is the same
thing as delta ij,

00:39:37.683 --> 00:39:39.100
I just want to put
it in this form

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.890
so that it looks like a
piece of a spacetime tensor.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.285
This is manifestly not
a tensorial equation.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.050
I have a bunch of derivatives
on my potential being

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.930
set equal to--

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.960
OK, there's a couple
constants, but this, OK?

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.605
When we learned about
quantities like this

00:40:00.605 --> 00:40:02.230
in undergraduate
physics, usually we're

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.440
told that this is a--

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.140
excuse me, this is a scalar.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.650
But we now know,
rho is not a scalar,

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:15.550
it is the mass density,
which up to a factor of c

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:21.040
squared, is the same thing
as the energy density.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.110
And when we examined
how this behaves

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.110
as we change between
inertial reference frames,

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:31.130
we found this transforms
like a particular component

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.630
of a tensor.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.310
And as I sort of emphasize,
not that long ago we

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.450
have been in something of
a didactic fury insisting

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.030
that everything be formulated
in terms of tensors.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.700
Pulling out a particular
component of a tensor

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.455
is bad math and bad physics.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.077
So we want to promote this
to something tensorial.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.100
So s on the
right-hand side, we've

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.380
got one component of the
stress energy tensor.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.830
We would like whatever
is going to be

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.980
on the right-hand
side of this equation

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.620
to be the stress
energy tensor, OK?

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.037
We can sort of
imagine that what's

00:41:56.037 --> 00:42:00.320
going on in Newton's gravity is
that there is one particular--

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.780
maybe there's one
component of this equation

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.652
that in all the
analyses that were done

00:42:05.652 --> 00:42:07.610
that led to our formation
of Newtonian gravity,

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.735
there may be one component
that was dominant, which

00:42:09.735 --> 00:42:12.620
is how it was that Newton
and everyone since then

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.795
was able to sort of pick
out a particular component

00:42:14.795 --> 00:42:18.290
of this equation
as being important.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:25.680
Over here on the left-hand
side, we saw earlier that

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.190
the equation of motion we're
going to look for corresponds

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:33.180
to the Newtonian limit if the
metric plays the same role--

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.540
up to factors of 2 and offsets
by 1 and things like that--

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.460
the metric must play the
same role as the Newtonian

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.567
gravitational potential.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.880
So if I look at--

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.370
if I look at the
Newtonian field equation,

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:01.720
I see two derivatives
acting on the potential.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:09.820
So I want my metric to
stand in for the potential,

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:21.930
we expect there to be
two derivatives of metric

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:23.473
entering this relationship.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.820
So now two derivatives
of the metric

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.480
is going to give me something
that smells like a curvature.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:31.190
So we want to put a curvature
tensor on the left-hand side

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.080
of this equation.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.630
We have several to
choose from, OK?

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.243
It clearly can't be
the Riemann tensor.

00:44:38.243 --> 00:44:40.160
There's too many indices,
it just doesn't fit.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.590
It could be the
Ricci curvature, OK?

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.350
The Ricci curvature
has two indices.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.880
That has two indices,
that's a candidate.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.880
But it's worth stopping
and reminding ourselves,

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.157
wait a minute, this
guy has some properties

00:44:52.157 --> 00:44:53.240
that I already know about.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.940
t mu nu tells me
about the properties

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:12.630
of energy and momentum
in my spacetime,

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.900
and as such, conservation--
local conservation

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.530
of energy and momentum requires
that it be divergence-free.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.020
So whatever this
curvature tensor is here

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:27.180
on the left-hand
side, we need it

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:36.520
to be a divergence-free
2-index mathematical object.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.990
At the beginning
of today's lecture,

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:47.370
I showed how by contracting
on the Bianchi identity,

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.910
you can, in fact, deduce that
there exists exactly such

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.160
a mathematical object.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:01.590
So let us suppose
that our equation that

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.290
relates the properties
of the spacetime

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.260
to the sources of energy
and momentum of my spacetime

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.350
is essentially that that
Einstein tensor, g mu nu,

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.360
be equal to the
stress energy tensor.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.450
Now in fact, they don't have the
same dimensions as each other,

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:28.370
so let's throw in a kappa, some
kind of a constant to make sure

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.250
that we get the right
units, the right dimensions,

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.110
and that we recover
the Newtonian limit.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.240
The way we're going to
deduce how well this works is

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.670
see whether an
equation of this form

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:51.800
gives me something that looks
like the Newtonian limit

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.980
when I go to what I'm going to
call the weak gravity limit,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.070
and I'm going to then use,
assuming it does work--

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.830
not to give away
the plot, it does--

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:06.110
we'll use that to figure out
what this constant kappa must

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:06.610
be.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:40.840
So if we do, in fact, have a
field equation of the form g

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.040
mu nu is some
constant t mu nu, it's

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.580
not too hard to figure out
that an equivalent form of this

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:58.230
is to say that the Ricci tensor
is k times t mu nu minus 1/2 g

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:04.560
mu nu t where this t is just
the trace of the stress energy

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.550
tensor.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.252
Remember, I spent a few moments
after we derived the Einstein

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:09.960
tensor pointing out
that it's essentially

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.030
the same thing as Ricci but
with the trace reversed.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.010
This is just a trace-reversed
equivalent to that equation.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:18.780
This step that I'm
introducing here,

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.453
basically it just
makes the algebra

00:48:20.453 --> 00:48:21.870
for the next
calculation I'm going

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:25.200
to do a little bit easier, OK?

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.190
So I just want to emphasize
that this and that are exactly

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.460
the same content.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.980
All right.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:39.000
So to make some headway, we need
to choose a form for a stress

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.200
energy tensor.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.140
Our goal is to recover
the Newtonian limit,

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.630
and so what we want to do is
make the stress energy tensor

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:49.830
of a body that corresponds to
the sort of sources of gravity

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:54.690
that are used in studies
of Newtonian gravity.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:59.160
So let's do something
very simple for us.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.620
Let's pick a static--

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.190
in other words,
no time variation,

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:18.110
a static perfect fluid
as our source of gravity.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.580
So I'm going to choose
for my t mu nu--

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:38.500
dial yourself back to lectures
where we talk about this, OK?

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.270
So this is the perfect
fluid stress energy tensor.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.610
We're working in
the Newtonian limit,

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:47.460
and we are working in units
where the speed of light

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.690
is equal to 1.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.758
If you put speed of light
back into these things,

00:49:50.758 --> 00:49:52.800
you explicitly include
it, this is actually a rho

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.705
c squared that appears here.

00:49:54.705 --> 00:49:56.970
And so what this tells me
is that if I'm studying sort

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:01.810
of Newtonian limit
problems, rho is much, much,

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:05.310
much greater than P in the
limit that we care about.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.595
Furthermore, I am treating
this fluid as being static.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.790
So that means that
my four velocity only

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:35.550
has one component, OK?

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:38.220
The fluid is not flowing.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.740
You might be tempted to say,
oh, OK, I can just put a 1

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.760
in for this.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.513
Not so fast, OK?

00:50:45.513 --> 00:50:47.430
Let's be a little bit
more careful about that.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.190
One of the key governing
properties of a four velocity

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:12.238
is that it is
properly normalized.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:21.038
So this equals g mu nu
u mu u nu is minus 1.

00:51:21.038 --> 00:51:24.800
We know that the only
components of this that matter,

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.370
so to speak, are the
mu and nu equal 0.

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:35.160
So this becomes g00 mu 0
squared equals minus 1.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:43.720
But g00 is-- well, let's
write it this way--

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:49.390
Negative 1 plus h00.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:59.640
Go through this algebra,
and what it tells you is u0

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:04.170
equals 1 plus 1/2 h00.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.760
Again, I'm doing my algebra
at leading order in h here.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.060
We raise and lower indices.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:23.850
So in my calculation,
I'm going to want to know

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.790
the downstairs version of this.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:32.520
And if I, again,
treat this thing--

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:39.620
treat this thing
consistently, OK.

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.840
What I'll find is I just
pick up a minus sign there.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.340
OK.

00:52:59.335 --> 00:52:59.835
OK.

00:53:03.177 --> 00:53:04.760
Let's now put all
the pieces together.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.590
The only component of
my stress energy tensor

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:15.410
that's going to
now really matter

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:21.050
is rho u0 u0, which, putting
all these ingredients back

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:27.030
together, is rho 1 plus h00.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:43.660
The trace of this guy, putting
all these pieces together,

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.910
is just equal to negative rho.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.268
Since I only have
one component that's

00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:50.810
going to end up
mattering, let's just

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.750
focus on one component of
my proposed field equation.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:05.610
OK?

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.277
So this is the guy
that I want to solve.

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:16.800
I'll let you digest that
and set up the calculation.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:46.370
We've got T00 minus 1/2
T00 T. This is going to be,

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:49.910
plugging in these bits that I
worked out on the other board,

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:50.540
here's my T00.

00:54:58.182 --> 00:54:59.990
Just make sure I did
that right earlier--

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.490
I did.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.000
OK.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.840
So this is my right-hand
side of my field equation.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.120
It will actually be
sufficient for our purposes

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.918
to neglect this term, OK?

00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:36.210
We'll see why in just a moment.

00:55:58.796 --> 00:56:03.840
So plugging that in, I need
to work out the 00 component

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.340
of my Ricci.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.160
So I go back to its
foundational definition.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.450
This is what I get when I
take the trace on indices 1

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:18.770
and 3 of the Riemann tensor.

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.010
I can simplify that to
just doing the trace over

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:29.550
the spatial indices, because the
term I'm leaving out is the one

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:33.200
that is of the form 00 here,
which by the anti-symmetry,

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.100
on exchange of those
indices, must vanish.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:56.870
Plugging in my
definition, what I find

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.550
is it is going to
look like this here.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:02.050
So I'm just going to neglect
the order of gamma squared term

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:03.925
because I'm working in
a limit where I assume

00:57:03.925 --> 00:57:06.047
that all these h's are small.

00:57:06.047 --> 00:57:08.630
This is going to vanish because
of my assumption of everything

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:13.350
being static in this limit.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:19.140
So this, I then go and
plug in my definitions.

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:39.593
OK.

00:57:39.593 --> 00:57:41.510
Again, I'm going to lose
these two derivatives

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:43.218
by the assumption of
things being static.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:53.337
And pardon me just a second--

00:57:53.337 --> 00:57:55.920
yeah, so I'm going to lose these
two because of the assumption

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.420
of things being static.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.250
The only derivative--
the only term

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.860
that's going to matter,
the derivative here is h.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:07.240
And so when I hit it
with the inverse metric,

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:22.540
this becomes simply the
derivative of the h00 piece,

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.040
OK?

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:31.600
I can go from g straight to eta
because the correction to this

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.070
is of order h squared, which
as I've repeatedly emphasized,

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.028
we're going to neglect.

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.113
All right, we're almost there.

00:58:47.113 --> 00:58:49.030
Let me put this board
up, I want to keep this.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.090
OK, where was I?

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.980
So I've got it down
to here, let me just

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.550
simplify this one step more.

00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:23.380
Eta is-- if mu is not
spatial, then this is just 0.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:27.880
So I can neatly change my
mu derivative into a j.

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:31.010
I can just focus on the
spatial piece of it.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:40.480
So this tells me R00 is minus
1/2 Kronecker delta delta i

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.800
delta j acting on h00.

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.436
This operator is
nothing more than--

00:59:47.436 --> 00:59:50.005
it's a Laplace operator.

00:59:50.005 --> 00:59:56.560
So this is minus 1/2, our
old-fashioned, happily,

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.220
well-known from
undergrad studies

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.220
Laplace operator on h00.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.270
So putting all this
together, my field

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:13.020
equation, which I
wrote in this form,

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:21.390
reduces down to del squared
h00 equals minus kappa rho.

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:41.650
The Newtonian limit that we
did for the equation of motion,

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:45.810
the fact that we showed that
geodesics correspond to this,

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:50.640
that already led me
to deduce that h00

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.360
was equal to minus 2 phi.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:07.170
My Newtonian field
equation requires

01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:20.050
me to have the Laplace operator
acting on the potential phi,

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:24.770
giving me 4 pi g rho.

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:29.520
Put all these pieces
together, and what

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.980
we see is this
proposed field equation

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:40.365
works perfectly provided we
choose for that constant.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.560
Kappa equals 8 pi j.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:10.880
And so we finally get g mu
nu equals 8 pi g t mu nu.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:19.290
This is known as the
Einstein field equation.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:28.900
So before I do a few
more things with it,

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.670
let us pause and
just sort of take

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:34.880
stock of what went
into this calculation.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.520
We have a ton of
mathematical tools

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.020
that we have developed
that allow us

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:43.370
to just to describe the
behavior of curved manifolds

01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:47.510
and the motion of bodies in
a moving curved manifolds.

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:50.870
We didn't yet have
a tool telling us

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:55.790
how the spacetime metric
can be specified, OK?

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.640
We didn't have the equivalent
of the Newtonian fuel equation

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.760
that told me how gravity
arises from a source.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.870
So what we did was we looked
at the geodesic equation,

01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:08.540
we went into a limit
where things deviated

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.610
just a little bit
from flat spacetime,

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:13.210
and we required objects be
moving non-relativistically

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:17.480
so that their spatial four
velocity components were all

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.410
small.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:23.660
That told us that we were able
to reproduce the Newtonian

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:28.310
equation of motion if h00, the
little deviation of spacetime

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.460
from flat spacetime
in the 00 piece,

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.330
was equal to negative 2 times
the Newtonian potential.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:40.190
We then said, well, the
Newtonian field equation

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:42.590
is sort of sick from a
relativistic perspective

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:45.440
because it is working with
a particular component

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.720
of a tensor rather
than with a tensor.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.640
So let's just ask
ourselves, how can we

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.970
promote this to a properly
constructed tensorial equation?

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:56.820
So we insisted the
right-hand side be t mu nu.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.480
And then we looked
for something that

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.690
looks like two derivatives
of the potential,

01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:06.320
or, more properly, two
derivatives of the metric

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.600
which is going to give
me a curvature tensor,

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.150
and say, OK, I want a
two-index curvature tensor

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:13.070
on the left-hand side.

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.650
Since stress energy
tensor is divergence-free,

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.350
I am forced to choose
a character tensor that

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:21.560
is divergence-free, and that's
what leads me to this object,

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.180
and there's the
Einstein curvature.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.880
And then insisting that
that procedure reproduce

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.550
the Newtonian limit when things
sort of deviate very slightly

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:34.147
from flat spacetime,
that insisted

01:04:34.147 --> 01:04:36.230
the constant proportionality
between the two sides

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.290
be 8 pi j.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:43.640
This, in a nutshell, is how
Einstein derived this equation

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:53.900
originally when it
was published in 1915.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.000
When I first went
through this exercise

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.870
and really appreciated
this, I was struck

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.580
by what a clever guy he was.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.270
And it is worth noting that
the mathematics for doing this

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:07.330
was very foreign to
Einstein at that time.

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:09.620
There's a reason
there's a 10-year gap

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.810
between his papers
on special relativity

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.570
and his presentation
of the field equations

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.070
of general relativity.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:21.680
Special relativity was 1905,
field equation was 1915.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.860
He was spending most of those
intervening 10 years learning

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:30.530
all the math that we have
been studying for the past six

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:31.880
or seven weeks, OK?

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.033
So we kind of have the luxury
of knowing what path to take.

01:05:36.033 --> 01:05:38.450
And so we were able to sort
of pick out the most important

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:40.490
bits so that we could sort of--

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:42.057
we knew where we wanted to go.

01:05:42.057 --> 01:05:43.890
He had to learn all
this stuff from scratch,

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.532
and he worked with quite
a few mathematicians

01:05:46.532 --> 01:05:47.615
to learn all these pieces.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.530
Having said that,
though, it did strike me

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:56.822
this is a somewhat ad
hoc kind of a derivation.

01:05:56.822 --> 01:05:59.030
When you look at this, you
might sort of think, well,

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:00.740
could we not--
might there not be

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.020
other things I could put on
either the left-hand side

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.500
or the right-hand
side that would still

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.390
respect the Newtonian limit?

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:22.830
And indeed, we can add any
divergence-free tensor onto--

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.080
depending how you count it--
either the left-hand side

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.372
or the right-hand side--
let's say the left-hand side--

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:36.340
and we would still have
a good field equation.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.960
Einstein himself was the
first one to note this.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.840
Here's an example of such
a divergence-free tensor.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.510
The metric itself, OK?

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.380
The metric is compatible with
the covariant derivative.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.380
Any covariant derivative
of the metric is 0.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:12.640
And so I can just put
the metric over here,

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.263
that's perfectly fine.

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.930
Now the dimensions
are a little bit off,

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:20.340
so we have to insert a
constant of proportionality

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.110
to make everything
come out right.

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:27.330
This lambda is known as
the cosmological constant.

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:41.080
Now what's kind
of interesting is

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.000
that one can write
down the Einstein field

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.140
equations in this way, but
you could just as easily

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.780
take that lambda g
mu nu and move it

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.050
onto the right-hand side and
think of this additional term

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:59.490
as a particularly special
source of stress energy.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.100
Let's do that.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:21.760
So let's define t
mu nu lambda equal

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:29.109
negative lambda over
8 pi g times g mu nu.

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:31.689
If we do that, we
then just have g

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:35.260
mu nu equals 8 pi gt mu nu
with a particular contribution

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:39.939
to our t mu nu being this
cosmological constant term.

01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:44.050
When we do this, what
you see is that t mu

01:08:44.050 --> 01:09:00.439
nu is nothing more than
a perfect fluid with rho

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:05.609
equals 8 pi g in the
freely-falling frame, pressure

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:09.620
of negative lambda over 8 pi j.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.300
Such a stress energy
tensor actually

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.330
arises in quantum
field theories.

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.776
This represents a form
of zero-point energy

01:09:21.776 --> 01:09:22.359
in the vacuum.

01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:35.830
You basically need
to look for something

01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:39.399
that is a stress energy tensor
that is isotopic and invariant

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.990
to Lorentz transformations
and the local Lorentz frame,

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:44.500
and that uniquely picks out
a stress energy tensor that

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.279
is proportional to the metric
in the freely-falling frame.

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:49.029
So this is an argument
that was originally

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:50.890
noted by Yakov Zeldovich.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.100
Whoops.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.170
And much of this
stuff was considered

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:18.470
to be kind of a
curiosity for years

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.600
until cosmological
observations--

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.850
we haven't done cosmology yet.

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:24.900
We will do this in
a couple of weeks--

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.740
a couple of lectures,
I should say.

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:30.950
And it turns out that
the large-scale structure

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:33.800
of our universe seems to support
the existence potentially

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.060
of there being a
cosmological constant.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:43.190
So the behavior of all these
things is a lot more relevant,

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:45.450
it's been a lot more
relevant over the past,

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:48.290
say, 15 or 20 years than
it was when I originally

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:51.920
learned the subject in 1993.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.830
So I want to just
conclude this lecture

01:10:54.830 --> 01:11:01.220
with a couple of remarks
about things that are commonly

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:07.130
set equal to 1 when we are doing
calculations of this point.

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:21.950
So one often sets G equal to
1 as well as c equal to 1.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.140
Carroll's textbook does not--

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.300
several other modern
textbooks do not--

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.480
I personally like for
pedagogical purposes leaving

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.320
the G in there, because it
is very useful for calling

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.420
out-- helping to understand the
way in which different terms

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.123
sort of couple in.

01:11:38.123 --> 01:11:40.540
It can-- if nothing else, it
serves as a very useful order

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.207
counting parameter,
something that we'll

01:11:42.207 --> 01:11:45.610
see in some of the future
calculations that we do.

01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:47.570
But there's a
reason why one often

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.660
works with G equal to 1 in
many relativity analyses.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:55.040
Fundamentally, this is because
gravity is a very weak force.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.160
G is the most
poorly known of all

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.038
of the fundamental
constants of nature.

01:12:00.038 --> 01:12:01.080
I think it's only known--

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.310
I forget the number
right now, but it's

01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:04.040
known to about
five or six digits.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.890
Contrast this with things like
the intrinsic magnetic moment

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:11.270
of the electron, which is known
to something like 13 digits.

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:15.230
What this sort of means is that
because G is so poorly known--

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.820
well, let me just write
that out in words first.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.440
So G is itself poorly known.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.600
And so when we
measure the properties

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:48.800
of various large
objects using gravity,

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:56.990
we typically find that something
like G times an object's mass

01:12:56.990 --> 01:13:06.400
is measured much
better than M alone.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.400
Basically, the observable
that one is probing

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.270
is G times M. To get M out
of that, you take G times M

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:15.700
and you divide by the
value of G that you

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.340
have determined independently.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.800
If you only know this guy
to five or six digits,

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.290
you're only going to know this
guy to five or six digits.

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:25.660
Whereas, for
instance, for our sun,

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.130
GM is known to about nine
digits, maybe even 10 digits

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.630
now.

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:45.630
When you set both G and
c to 1, what you find

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:53.640
is that mass, time,
and length all come out

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.120
having the same dimension.

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:21.200
And what that means is that
certain factors of G and c

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.275
can be combined to become
convergent factors.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.540
So in particular, the
combination over c squared,

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.375
it converts a normal mass--
let's say an SI mass--

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:38.050
into a length.

01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:50.500
A very useful one is G times the
mass of the sun over c squared

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:55.340
is 1.47 kilometers.

01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.590
GM over c cubed, OK?

01:14:57.590 --> 01:15:01.440
You're going to divide by
another factor of velocity.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:08.280
This takes mass to time.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.630
So a similar one, G
mass sun over c cubed,

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:17.825
this is 4.92 times 10
to minus 6 seconds.

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:28.550
One more before I
conclude this lecture.

01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:52.820
(I can't erase this equation,
it's too beautiful!)

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:59.690
If I do g over c to the fourth,
this converts energy to length.

01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:08.330
I'm not going to give the
numeric value of this,

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.122
but I'm going to make
a comment about this.

01:16:10.122 --> 01:16:15.360
So bear in mind that your
typical component of T mu nu

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.600
has the dimensional form
energy per unit volume--

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:26.550
i.e., energy over length cubed.

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:35.830
So if I take G over c to
the fourth times T mu nu,

01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:42.130
that is going to give me a
length over a length cubed--

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.270
in other words, 1
over length squared,

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:52.504
which is exactly what
you get for curvature.

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.820
So when one writes the
Einstein field equations,

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:08.587
if you leave your G's
and your c's in there,

01:17:08.587 --> 01:17:10.920
the correct coupling factor
between your Einstein tensor

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.628
and your stress energy
tensor is actually

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:15.320
8 pi G over c to the fourth.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.270
And I just want to leave
you with the observation

01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:21.180
that G is a pretty
small constant,

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:24.390
c to the fourth is a
rather large constant,

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:28.260
and so we are getting a
tiny amount of curvature

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:30.840
from a tremendous
amount of stress energy.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.190
Spacetime is hard to bend.

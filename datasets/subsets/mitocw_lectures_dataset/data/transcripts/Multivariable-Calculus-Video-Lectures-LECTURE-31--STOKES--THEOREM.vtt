00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Recall that yesterday we saw,
no, two days ago we learned

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about the curl of a vector field
in space.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And we said the curl of F is
defined by taking a cross

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
product between the symbol dell
and the vector F.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Concretely, the way we would
compute this would be by putting

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the components of F into this
determinant and expanding and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
then getting a vector with
components Ry minus Qz,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Pz minus Rx and Qx minus Py.
I think I also tried to explain

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
very quickly what the
significance of a curl is.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Just to tell you again very
quickly,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
basically curl measures,
if you mention that your vector

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
field measures the velocity in
some fluid then the curl

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
measures how much rotation is
taking place in that fluid.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Measures the rotation part of a
velocity field.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
More precisely the direction
corresponds to the axis of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
rotation and the magnitude
corresponds to twice the angular

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
velocity.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Just to give you a few quick
examples.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If I take a constant vector
field,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
so everything translates at the
same speed,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
then obviously when you take
the partial derivatives you will

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
just get a bunch of zeros so the
curl will be zero.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If you take a vector field that
stretches things,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
let's say, for example,
we are going to stretch things

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
along the x-axis,
that would be a vector field

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that goes parallel to the x
direction but maybe,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
say, x times i.
So that when you are in front

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
of a plane of a blackboard you
are moving forward,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
when you are behind you are
moving backwards,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
things are getting expanded in
the x direction.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
If you compute the curl,
you can check each of these.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Again, they are going to be
zero.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
There is no curl.
This is not what curl measures.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I mean, actually,
what measures expansion,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
stretching is actually
divergence.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
If you take the divergence of
this field,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
you would get one plus zero
plus zero,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
it looks like it will be one,
so in case you don't remember,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I mean divergence precisely
measures this stretching effect

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in your field.
And, on the other hand,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
if you take something that
corresponds to,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
say,
rotation about the z-axis at

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
unit angular velocity -- That
means they are going to moving

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in circles around the z-axis.
One way to write down this

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
field, let's see,
the z component is zero because

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
everything is moving
horizontally.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And in the x and y directions,
if you look at it from above,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
well, it is just going to be
our good old friend the vector

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
field that rotates everything
[at unit speed?].

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And we have seen the formula
for this one many times.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The first component is minus y,
the second one is x.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Now, if you compute the curl of
this guy, you will get zero,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
zero, two, two k.
And so k is the axis of

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
rotation, two is twice the
angular velocity.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And now, of course,
you can imagine much more

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
complicated motions where you
will have -- For example,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
if you look at the Charles
River very carefully then you

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
will see that water is flowing,
generally speaking,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
towards the ocean.
But, at the same time,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
there are actually a few eddies
in there and with water

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
swirling.
Those are the places where

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
there is actually curl in the
flow.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Yes.
I don't know how to turn out

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the lights a bit,
but I'm sure there is a way.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Does this do it?
Is it working?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:23.000
OK.
You're welcome.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Hopefully it is easier to see
now.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
That was about curl.
Now, why do we care about curl

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
besides this motivation of
understanding motions?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
One place where it comes up is
when we try to understand

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
whether a vector field is
conservative.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Remember we have seen that a
vector field is conservative if

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and only if its curl is zero.
That is the situation in which

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
we are allowed to try to look
for a potential function and

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
then use the fundamental
theorem.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But another place where this
comes up,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
if you remember what we did in
the plane,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
curl also came up when we tried
to convert nine integrals into

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
double integrals.
That was Greene's theorem.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Well, it turns out we can do
the same thing in space and that

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is called Stokes' theorem.
What does Stokes' theorem say?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It says that the work done by a
vector field along a closed

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
curve can be replaced by a
double integral of curl F.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Let me write it using the dell
notation.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
That is curl F.
Dot ndS on a suitably chosen

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
surface.
That is a very strange kind of

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
statement.
But actually it is not much

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
more strange than things we have
seen before.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I should clarify what this
means.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
C has to be a closed curve in
space.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And S can be any surface
bounded by C.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
For example,
what Stokes' theorem tells me

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is that let us say that I have
to compute some line integral on

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
maybe,
say, the unit circle in the x,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
y plane.
Of course I can set a line

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
integral directly and compute it
by setting x equals cosine T,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
y equals sine T,
z equals zero.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But maybe sometimes I don't
want to do that because my

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
vector field is really
complicated.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And instead I will want to
reduce things to a surface

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
integral.
Now, I know that you guys are

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
not necessarily fond of
computing flux of vector fields

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
for surfaces so maybe you don't
really see the point.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But sometimes it is useful.
Sometimes it is also useful

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
backwards because,
actually, you have a surface

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
integral that you would like to
turn into a line integral.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
What Stokes' theorem says is
that I can choose my favorite

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
surface whose boundary is this
circle.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I could choose,
for example,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
a half sphere if I want or I
can choose, let's call that s1,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I don't know,
a pointy thing,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
s2.
Probably the most logical one,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
actually, would be just to
choose a disk in the x,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
y plane.
That would probably be the

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
easiest one to set up for
calculating flux.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Anyway,
what Stokes' theorem tells me

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
is I can choose any of these
surfaces,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
whichever one I want,
and I can compute the flux of

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
curl F through this surface.
Curl F is a new vector field

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
when you have this formula that
gives you a vector field you

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
compute its flux through your
favorite surface,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and you should get the same
thing as if you had done the

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
line integral for F.
That is the statement.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Now, there is a catch here.
What is the catch?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Well, the catch is we have to
figure out what conventions to

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
use because remember when we
have a surface there are two

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
possible orientations.
We have to decide which way we

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
will counter flux positively,
which way we will counter flux

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
negatively.
And, if we change our choice,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
then of course the flux will
become the opposite.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Well, similarly to define the
work, I need to choose which way

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I am going to run my curve.
If I change which way I go

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
around the curve then my work
will become the opposite.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
What happens is I have to
orient the curve C and the

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
surface S in compatible ways.
We have to figure out what the

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
rule is for how the orientation
of S and that of C relate to

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
each other.
What about orientation?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Well, we need the orientations
of C and S to be compatible and

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:05.000
they have to explain to you what
the rule is.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Let me show you a picture.
The rule is if I walk along C

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000
with S to my left then the
normal vector is pointing up for

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
me.
Let me write that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
If I walk along C,
I should say in the positive

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:48.000
direction, in the direction that
I have chosen to orient C.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:06.000
With S to my left then n is
pointing up for me.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Here is the example.
If I am walking on this curve,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
it looks like the surface is to
my left.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And so the normal vector is
going towards what is up for me.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Any questions about that?
I see some people using their

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
right hands.
That is also right-handable

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
which I am going to say in just
a few moments.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
That is another way to remember
this.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Before I tell you about the
right-handable version,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
let me just try something.
Actually, I am not happy with

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
this orientation of C and I want
to orient my curve C going

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
clockwise on the picture.
So the other orientation.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Then, if I walk on it this way,
the surface would be to my

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
right.
You can remember,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
if it helps you,
that if a surface is to your

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
right then the normal vector
will go down.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
The other way to think about
this rule is enough because if

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
you are walking clockwise,
well, you can change that to

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
counterclockwise just by walking
upside down.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
This guy is walking clockwise
on C.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And while for him,
if you look carefully at the

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:31.000
picture, the surface is actually
to his left when you flip upside

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
down.
Yeah, it is kind of confusing.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
But, anyway,
maybe it's easier if you

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
actually rotate in the picture.
And now it is getting actually

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
really confusing because his
walking upside up with,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
actually, the surface is to his
left.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I mean where he is at here is
actually at the front and this

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is the back, but that is kind of
hard to see.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Anyway, whichever method will
work best for you.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Perhaps it is easiest to first
do it with the other

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
orientation,
this one,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and this side,
if you want the opposite one,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000
then you will just flip
everything.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Now, what is the other way of
remembering this with the

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
right-hand rule?
First of all,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
take your right hand,
not your left.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Even if your right hand is
actually using a pen or

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
something like that in your
right hand do this.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And let's take your fingers in
order.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
First your thumb.
Let's make your thumb go along

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
the object that has only one
dimension in there.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
That is the curve.
Well, let's look at the top

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
picture up there.
I want my thumb to go along the

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
curve so that is kind of towards
the right.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Then I want to make my index
finger point towards the

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
surface.
Towards the surface I mean

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
towards the interior of the
surface from the curve.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And when I am on the curve I am
on the boundary of the surface,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
so there is a direction along
the surface that is the curve

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and the other one is pointing
into the surface.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
That one would be pointing kind
of to the back slightly up

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
maybe, so like that.
And now your middle finger is

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
going to point in the direction
of the normal vector.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
That is up, at least if you
have the same kind of right hand

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:49.000
as I do.
The other way of doing it is

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:08.000
using the right-hand rule along
C positively.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
The index finger towards the
interior of S.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Sorry, I shouldn't say interior.
I should say tangent to S

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
towards the interior of S.
What I mean by that is really

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
the part of S that is not its
boundary, so the rest of the

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.000
surface.
Then the middle finger points

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:00.000
parallel to n.
Let's practice.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Let's say that I gave you this
curve bounding this surface.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Which way do you think the
normal vector will be going?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Up. Yes. Everyone is voting up.
Imaging that I am walking

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
around C.
That is to my left.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Normal vector points up.
Imagine that you put your thumb

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
along C, your index towards S
and then your middle finger

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
points up.
Very good.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
N points up.
Another one.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
It is interesting to watch you
guys.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I think mostly it is going up.
The correct answer is it goes

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
up and into the cone.
How do we see that?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Well, one way to think about it
is imagine that you are walking

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
on C, on the rim of this cone.
You have two options.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Imagine that you are walking
kind of inside or imagine that

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
you are walking kind of outside.
If you are walking outside then

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
S is to your right,
but it does not sound good.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Let's say instead that you are
walking on the inside of a cone

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
following the boundary.
Well, then the surface is to

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
your left.
And so the normal vector will

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
be up for you which means it
will be pointing slightly up and

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
into the cone.
Another way to think about it,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
through the right-hand rule,
from this way index going kind

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
of down because the surface goes
down and a bit to the back.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And then the normal vector
points up and in.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Yet another way,
if you deform continuously your

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
surface then the conventions
will not change.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
See, this is kind of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
in a way.
You can deform things and

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
nothing will change.
So what if we somehow flatten

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
our cone, push it a bit up so
that it becomes completely flat?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Then, if you had a flat disk
with the curve going

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
counterclockwise,
the normal vector would go up.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Now take your disk with its
normal vector sticking up.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
If you want to paint the face a
different color so that you can

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
remember that was beside with a
normal vector and then push it

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
back down to the cone,
you will see that the painted

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
face,
the one with the normal vector

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
on that side is the one that is
inside and up.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Does that make sense?
Anyway, I think you have just

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
to play with these examples for
long enough and get it.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
OK. The last one.
Let's say that I have a

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
cylinder.
So now this guy has actually

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
two boundary curves,
C and C prime.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And let's say I want to orient
my cylinder so that the normal

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
vector sticks out.
How should I choose the

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000
orientation of my curves?
Let's start with,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
say, the bottom one.
Would the bottom one be going

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
clockwise or counterclockwise.
Most people seem to say

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
counterclockwise,
and I agree with that.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Let me write that down and
claim C prime should go

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
counterclockwise.
One way to think about it,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
actually, it's quite easy,
you mentioned that you're

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
walking on the outside of the
cylinder along C prime.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
If you want to walk along C
prime so that the cylinder is to

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
your left, that means you have
to actually go counterclockwise

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
around it.
The other way is use your right

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
hand.
Say when you're at the front of

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
C prime,
your thumb points to the right,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
your index points up because
that's where the surface is,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and then your middle finger
will point out.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:39.000
What about C?
Well, C I claim we should be

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
doing clockwise.
I mean think about just walking

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
again on the surface of the
cylinder along C.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
If you walk clockwise,
you will see that the surface

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
is to your left or use the
right-hand rule.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Now, if a problem gives you
neither the orientation of a

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
curve nor that of the surface
then it's up to you to make them

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
up.
But you have to make them up in

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
a consistent way.
You cannot choose them both at

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
random.
All right.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Now we're all set to try to use
Stokes' theorem.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Well, let me do an example
first.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
The first example that I will
do is actually a comparison.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Stokes' versus Green.
I want to show you how Green's

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
theorem for work that we saw in
the plane,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
but also involved work and curl
and so on,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
is actually a special case of
this.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Let's say that we will look at
the special case where our curve

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
C is actually a curve in the x,
y plane.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And let's make it go
counterclockwise in the x,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
y plane because that's what we
did for Green's theorem.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Now let's choose a surface
bounded by this curve.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Well, as I said,
I could make up any surface

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
that comes to my mind.
But, if I want to relate to

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
this stuff, I should probably
stay in the x,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
y plane.
So I am just going to take my

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
surface to be the piece of the
x, y plane that is inside my

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000
curve.
So let's say S is going to be a

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.000
portion of x,
y plane bounded by a curve C,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.000
and the curve C goes
counterclockwise.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Well, then I should look at
[the table?].

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
For work along C of my favorite
vector field F dot dr.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
So that will be the line
integral of Pdx plus Qdy.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Like I said,
if I call the components of my

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
field P, Q and R,
it will be Pdx plus Qdy plus

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Rdz, but I don't have any Z
here.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Dz is zero on C.
If I evaluate for line

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
integral, I don't have any term
involving dz.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Z is zero.
Now, let's see what Strokes

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
says.
Stokes says instead I can

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
compute for flux through S of
curve F.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
But now what's the normal
vector to my surface?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Well, it's going to be either k
or negative k.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
I just have to figure out which
one it is.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Well, if you followed what
we've done there,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
you know that the normal vector
compatible with this choice for

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
the curve C is the one that
points up.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:43.000
My normal vector is just going
to be k hat, so I am going to

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
replace my normal vector by k
hat.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
That means, actually,
I will be integrating curl dot

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
k.
That means I am integrating the

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:04.000
z component of curl.
Let's look at curl F dot k.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:14.000
That's the z component of curl
F.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And what's the z component of
curl?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Well, I conveniently still have
the values up there.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:36.000
It's Q sub x minus P sub y.
My double integral becomes

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
double integral of Q sub x minus
P sub y.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
What about dS?
Well, I am in a piece of the x,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
y plane, so dS is just dxdy or
your favorite combination that

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
does the same thing.
Now, see, if you look at this

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
equality, integral of Pdx plus
Qdy along a closed curve equals

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
double integral of Qx minus Py
dxdy.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
That is exactly the statement
of Green's theorem.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I mean except at that time we
called things m and n,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
but really that shouldn't
matter.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:35.000
This tells you that,
in fact, Green's theorem is

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:51.000
just a special case of Stokes'
in the x, y plane.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Now, another small remark I
want to make right away before I

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
forget,
you might think that these

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
rules that we've made up about
compatibility of orientations

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
are completely arbitrary.
Well, they are literally in the

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
same way as our convention for
which we guy curl is arbitrary.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
We chose to make the curl be
this thing and not the opposite

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
which would have been pretty
much just as sensible.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And, ultimately,
that comes from our choice of

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
making the cross-product be what
it is but of the opposite.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Ultimately, it all comes from
our preference for right-handed

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
coordinate systems.
If we had been on the planet

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
with left-handed coordinate
systems then actually our

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
conventions would be all the
other way around,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:30:05.000
but they are this way.
Any other questions?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
A surface that you use in
Stokes' theorem is usually not

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
going to be closed because its
boundary needs to be the curve

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
C.
So if you had a closed surface

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
you wouldn't know where to put
your curve.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I mean of course you could make
a tiny hole in it and get a tiny

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
curve.
Actually, what that would say,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
and we are going to see more
about that so not very important

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
right now,
but what we would see is that

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
for a close surface we would end
up getting zero for the flux.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And that is actually because
divergence of curl is zero,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
but I am getting ahead of
myself.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:45.000
We are going to see that
probably tomorrow in more

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
detail.
Stokes' theorem only works if

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
you can make sense of this.
That means you need your vector

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
field to be continuous and
differentiable everywhere on the

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
surface S.
Now, why is that relevant?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Well, say that your vector
field was not defined at the

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
origin and say that you wanted
to do,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
you know, the example that I
had first with the unit circling

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
the x, y plane.
Normally, the most sensible

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
choice of surface to apply
Stokes' theorem to would be just

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
the flat disk in the x,
y plane.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
But that assumes that your
vector field is well-defined

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
there.
If your vector field is not

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
defined at the origin but
defined everywhere else you

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
cannot use this guy,
but maybe you can still use,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
say, the half-sphere,
for example.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Or, you could use a piece of
cylinder plus a flat top or

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
whatever you want but not
pressing for the origin.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
So you could still use Stokes
but you'd have to be careful

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
about which surface you choose.
Now, if instead your vector

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
field is not defined anywhere on
the z-axis then you're out of

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
luck because there is no way to
find a surface bounded by this

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
unit circle without crossing the
z-axis somewhere.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Then you wouldn't be able to
Stokes' theorem at all or at

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:16.000
least not directly.
Maybe I should write it F

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:25.000
defines a differentiable
everywhere on this.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
But we don't care about what
happens outside of this.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000
It's really only on the surface
that we need it to be OK.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
I mean, again,
99% of the vector fields that

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
we see in this class are defined
everywhere so that's not an

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
urgent concern,
but still.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
OK.
Should we move on?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Yes. I have a yes.
Let me explain to you quickly

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.000
why Stokes is true.
How do we prove a theorem like

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
that?
Well,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
the strategy,
I mean there are other ways,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
but the least painful strategy
at this point is to observe what

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
we already know is a special
case of Stokes's theorem.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Namely we know the case where
the curve is actually in the x,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
y plane and the surface is a
flat piece of the x,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:34.000
y plane because that's Green's
theorem which we proved a while

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:42.000
ago.
We know it for C and S in the

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
x, y plane.
Now, what if C and S were,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
say, in the y,
z plane instead of the x,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
y plane?
Well, then it will not quite

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
give the same picture because
the normal vector would be i hat

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
instead of k hat and they would
be having different notations

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
and it would be integrating with
y and z.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
But you see that it would
become, again,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
exactly the same formula.
We'd know it for any of the

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
coordinate planes.
In fact, I claim we know it for

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
absolutely any plane.
And the reason for that is,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
sure, when we write it in
coordinates,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
when we write that this line
integral is integral of Pdx plus

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Qdy plus Rdz or when we write
that the curl is given by this

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
formula we use the x,
y, z coordinate system.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
But there is something I
haven't quite told you about.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Which is if I switch to any
other right-handed coordinate

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
system,
so I do some sort of rotation

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
of my space coordinates,
then somehow the line integral,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
the flux integral,
the notion of curl makes sense

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
in coordinates.
And the reason is that they all

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
have geometric interpretations.
For example,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
when I think of this as the
work done by a force,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
well, the force doesn't care
whether it's being put in x,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
y coordinates this way or that
way.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
It still does the same work
because it's the same force.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And when I say that the curl
measures the rotation in a

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
motion, well,
that depends on which

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
coordinates you use.
And the same for interpretation

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
of flux.
In fact, if I rotated my

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
coordinates to fit with any
other plane, I could still do

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
the same things.
What I'm trying to say is,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000
in fact, if C and S are in any
plane then we can still claim

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
that it reduces to Green's
theorem.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
It will be Green's theorem not
in x, y, z coordinates but in

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
some funny rotated coordinate
systems.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
What I'm saying is that work,
flux and curl makes sense

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
independently of coordinates.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Now, this has to stop somewhere.
I can start claiming that I can

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
somehow bend my coordinates to a
plane, any surface is flat.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
That doesn't really work.
But what I can say is if I have

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
any surface I can cut it into
tiny pieces.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And these tiny pieces are
basically flat.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
So that's basically the idea of
a proof.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000
I am going to decompose my
surface into very small flat

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:56.000
pieces.
Given any S we are just going

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:08.000
to decompose it into tiny almost
flat pieces.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000
For example,
if I have my surface like this,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.000
what I will do is I will just
cut it into tiles.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
I mean a good example of that
is if you look at

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
[UNINTELLIGIBLE],
for example,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
it's made of all these hexagons
and pentagons.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Well, actually,
they're not quite flat in the

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
usual rule, but you could make
them flat and it would still

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
look pretty much like a sphere.
Anyway, you're going to cut

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
your surface into lots of tiny
pieces.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
And then you can use Stokes'
theorem on each small piece.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
What it says on each small flat
piece -- It says that the line

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
integral along say,
for example,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
this curve is equal to the flux
of a curl through this tiny

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
piece of surface.
And now I will add all of these

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
terms together.
If I add all of the small

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
contributions to flux I get the
total flux.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
What if I add all of the small
line integrals?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Well, I get lots of extra junk
because I never asked to compute

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
the line integral along this.
But this guy will come in twice

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
when I do this little plate and
when I do that little plate with

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
opposite orientations.
When I sum all of the little

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
line integrals together,
all of the inner things cancel

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
out,
and the only ones that I go

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
through only once are those that
are at the outer most edges.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
So, when I sum all of my works
together, I will get the work

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
done just along the outer
boundary C.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Sum of work around each little
piece is just actually the work

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:27.000
along C, the outer curve.
And the sum of the flux for

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:39.000
each piece is going to be the
flux through S.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
From Stokes' theorem for flat
surfaces, I can get it for any

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
surface.
I am cheating a little bit

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
because you would actually have
to check carefully that this

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
approximately where you flatten
the little pieces that are

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
almost flat is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
But, trust me,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.000
it actually works.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Let's do an actual example.
I mean I said example,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
but that was more like getting
us ready for the proof so

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
probably that doesn't count as
an actual example.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I should probably keep these
statements for now so I am not

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
going to erase this side.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Let's do an example.
Let's try to find the work of

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:40.000
vector field zi plus xj plus yk
around the unit circle in the x,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:58.000
y plane counterclockwise.
The picture is conveniently

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.000
already there.
Just as a quick review,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
let's see how we do that
directly.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
If we do that directly,
I have to find the integral

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000
along C.
So F dot dr becomes zdx plus

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000
xdy plus ydz.
But now we actually know that

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
on this circle,
well, z is zero.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
And we can parameterize x and
y, the unit circle in the x,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
y plane, so we can take x
equals cosine t,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
y equals sine t.
That will just become the

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
integral over C.
Well, z times dx,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:05.000
z is zero so we have nothing,
plus x is cosine t times dy is

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:17.000
-- Well, if y is sine t then dy
is cosine tdt plus ydz but z is

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
zero.
Now, the range of values for t,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
well, we are going
counterclockwise around the

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
entire circle so that should go
from zero to 2pi.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.000
We will get integral from zero
to 2pi of cosine square tdt

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
which, if you do the
calculation, turns out to be

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
just pi.
Now, let's instead try to use

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Stokes' theorem to do the
calculation.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Now, of course the smart choice
would be to just take the flat

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
unit disk.
I am not going to do that.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
That would be too boring.
Plus we have already kind of

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
checked it because we already
trust Green's theorem.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Instead, just to convince you
that,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
yes, I can choose really any
surface I want,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000
let's say that I'm going to
choose a piece of paraboloid z

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
equals one minus x squared minus
y squared.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Well, to get our conventions
straight, we should take the

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
normal vector pointing up for
compatibility with our choice.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Well, we will have to compute
the flux through S.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
We don't really have to because
we could have chosen the disk,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
it would be easier,
but if we want to do it this

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
way we will compute the flux of
curl F through our paraboloid.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
How do we do that?
Well, we need to find the curl

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
and we need to find ndS.
Let's start with the curl.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Curl F let's take the
cross-product between dell and F

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
which is zxy.
If we compute this,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
the i component will be one
minus zero.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
It looks like it is one i.
Minus the j component is zero

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
minus one.
Plus the k component is one

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:52.000
minus zero.
In fact, the curl of the field

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000
is one, one, one.
Now, what about ndS?

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Well, this is a surface for
which we know z is a function of

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
x and y.
ndS we can write as,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000
let's call this F of xy,
then we can use the formula

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
that says ndS equals negative F
sub x, negative F sub y,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.000
one dxdy,
which here gives us 2x,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
2y, one dxdy.
Now, when we want to compute

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:41.000
the flux, we will have to do
double integral over S of one,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
one, one dot product with 2x,
2y, one dxdy.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000
It will become the double
integral of 2x plus 2y plus one

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
dxdy.
And, of course,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
the region which we are
integrating, the range of values

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
of x and y will be the shadow of
our surface.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
That is just going to be,
if you look at this paraboloid

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
from above,
all you will see is the unit

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000
disk so it will be a double
integral of the unit disk.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And the way we will do that,
one way is to switch to polar

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
coordinates and do the
calculation and then you will

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
end up with pi.
The other way is to try to do

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
it by symmetry.
Observe, when you integrate x

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
above this, x is as negative on
the left as it is positive on

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
the right.
So the integral of x will be

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
zero.
The integral of y will be zero

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
also by symmetry.
Then the integral of one dxdy

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
will just be the area of this
unit disk which is pi.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
That was our first example.
And, of course,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
if you're actually free to
choose your favorite surface,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
there is absolutely no reason
why you would actually choose

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
this paraboloid in this example.
I mean it would be much easier

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
to choose a flat disk.
OK.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Tomorrow I will tell you a few
more things about curl fits in

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
with conservativeness and with
the divergence theorem,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Stokes all together,
and we will look at Practice

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Exam 4B so please bring the exam
with you.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
with you.

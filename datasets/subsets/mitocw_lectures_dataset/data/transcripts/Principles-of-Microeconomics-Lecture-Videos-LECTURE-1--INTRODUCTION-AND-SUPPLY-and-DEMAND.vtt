00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.680
JONATHAN GRUBER: This is 14.01.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.250
I'm John Gruber, and
this is microeconomics.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.500
Today, I want to
cover three things.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.840
I want to talk about
the course details.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.910
I want to talk about
what is microeconomics.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.120
And then I'll start the
substance of the course

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.447
by talking about
supply and demand.

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:33.530
Couple of the points about
the course-- the course

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.710
will have a distinct sort
of policy angle to it.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.680
I sort of do economic policy,
government policy is my thing.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.890
So I think it's what
makes economics exciting

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.080
and it sort of offers, I
think, an interesting angle

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.480
to understand why we're
learning what we're learning.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.980
I think sometimes
in an intro class,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.813
it's sort of hard to
understand why the heck

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:52.700
you're doing things.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.690
However, that's just
sort of a slight flavor.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.730
If you're really more
interested in this,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.463
I teach a whole
course called 1441.

00:00:57.463 --> 00:00:59.005
I'm not teaching it
this year, but it

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.000
will be taught by a visitor
in the spring, Kristin Butcher

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.860
from Wellesley.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.190
And I'll be teaching next year.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.527
That dives much more
into these policy issues.

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:09.110
So I'm going to use government
policy as sort of an organizing

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500
theme, but it won't be the
dominant theme of the class.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.297
Finally, three points
about my teaching style.

00:01:15.297 --> 00:01:16.880
I don't write
everything on the board.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.255
We're not in high
school anymore.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.140
You're actually responsible for
what I say, not what I write.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.170
Partly that's because my
handwriting is brutal,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.840
as you can tell already.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.240
So what that means is,
please, please do not

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.090
be afraid to ask me what the
hell I just wrote on the board.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.380
There's no shame in that.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.830
Don't just lean to your
neighbors, and say,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.840
what the hell did he
just write in the board.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.423
Ask, me, because if
you can't read it,

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:40.380
I'm sure someone else can't
read it, so feel free to ask.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740
And in general, please
feel free to engage

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.360
with questions in this class.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.570
The other point of my teaching
style is I talk way too fast.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.820
And the longer I go-- there's
a mathematical function,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.737
which is the longer I
go without interruption,

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:54.710
the faster I speak,
until I just spin off.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.740
So basically, please
ask questions.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.300
If anything is not
clear, or you just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.030
want to ask questions
about some related tangent

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.125
or whatever, please
feel free to do so.

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.500
You might think, how would
that work in a class this big?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.252
There's always way too
few questions, even

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:08.960
a class this big.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.672
So never be afraid that it
will slow me down or whatever.

00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:12.380
Ask me questions.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.687
We have plenty of
time on the class.

00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:16.520
And you'll be doing
your classmates a favor,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.650
because it'll slow me down.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.380
Finally, last point, I
have this terrible tendency

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.260
to use the term "guys"
in a gender neutral way.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.270
So this class, I
like to see, looks

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.720
like it's a fairly
healthy representation

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.750
both males and females.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.250
When I say "guys,"
I don't mean men.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.090
I mean people.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090
I mean people.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.180
So women, don't
take it personally.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.373
"Guys" means economic agent.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:37.040
It means people.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.902
It doesn't mean men.

00:02:37.902 --> 00:02:39.360
Just the way-- just
a bad tendency.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.720
It drives my wife crazy,
but I've decided better

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.200
to just apologize up front
than try to fix it throughout,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.870
which is impossible.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.620
So let's talk about
what is microeconomics.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.190
So fundamentally,
microeconomics-- how people

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.960
took AP high school Econ?

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.017
How many people--
for how many people

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.100
was it taught really well?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.805
That's about right.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:10.680
That's why I did my high
school online class.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.970
That's the answer
I wanted to hear.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.880
So tell your friends
still in high school who

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.880
are taking high school
Econ, if your high school

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.800
teacher isn't great,
tell them to go on EdX

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.540
and take the class.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.750
And help out your friends
still in high school.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.320
So what is microeconomics?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.370
Microeconomics is
the study of how

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.160
individuals and
firms make decisions

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.120
in a world of scarcity.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.270
Scarcity is what
drives microeconomics.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.250
Basically, what
microeconomics is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.770
is a series of constrained
optimization exercises,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.030
where economic agents, be
they firms or individuals,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.240
try to make themselves
as well off as possible

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.140
given their constraints.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.640
Yeah.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.740
AUDIENCE: Will this
cover irrationality?

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.232
JONATHAN GRUBER: I will,
but not as much as I should.

00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:09.690
Essentially, we
have another course

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.690
in the department called 1413,
Behavioral Economics, which

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.950
gets into that much more.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.560
I will sprinkle it
throughout, but not

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.430
as much as I actually
believe in it.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.430
In other words, the way
we think about economics

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.282
is it's best to sort
of get the basics down

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:24.240
before you start worrying
about the deviations.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.657
Find it's better
to climb the tree

00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:28.680
before you start going
out in the branches.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.130
So basically, what this
course is then about

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.420
is it's about trade-offs.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.760
It's about given that
you're constrained,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.450
how do you trade off things
to make yourself as well off

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.250
as possible?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.025
And behind this notion of
trade-offs is going to be--

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.400
I'll say about 100 times this
is the most important thing

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.030
in the course, so
just ignore that.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.160
But this is one of the
most important things.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.120
I'll say "one of the
most important" things

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.535
in the course, is the
notion of opportunity cost.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.320
Opportunity cost is a
very important concept

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.530
that we teach, sort of the
first concept we teach,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.230
which is that every
action or every inaction

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.660
has a cost in that you
could've been doing something

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.670
else instead.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.680
So if you buy a shirt, you
could have bought pants.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.870
If you stayed at
home and watched TV,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.180
you could have been out working.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.670
Everything you do has
a next best alternative

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.470
you could have done instead.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.630
And that is called the
"opportunity cost."

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.230
And that's a critical
concept in economics,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.790
and that is why,
in some sense, we

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.292
are referred to casually
as the "dismal science."

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.250
Economics is referred to
as the dismal science.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.920
First of all, I'm flattered
we're considered a science.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.480
But it's called the
"dismal science"

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.573
because our whole point
is that nothing is free.

00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:50.740
There is always a trade-off.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.198
There's always an
opportunity cost.

00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:56.290
Anything you do, you could be
doing something else instead.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.670
And your constrained
optimization

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.890
means you're going to
have to pass up one thing

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.330
to do another.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.820
Now, some may call it
"dismal," but as a former MIT

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.680
undergraduate, I call it "fun."

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.810
And this is why I think
MIT is the perfect place

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.452
to be teaching economics,
because MIT engineering is

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:12.910
all about constrained
optimization.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.355
That's what engineering is.

00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:15.730
And economics is
just the engine.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.860
It's just the principles
you learn in engineering

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.890
applied in different contexts.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.540
So if we think about the
2.007 contests-- that still

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.210
exist with the robots, 2.007?

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.432
Yeah, the 2.007 contests,
those, as you know,

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.890
are contests where you're given
a limited set of materials.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.990
And you have to build a
robot that does some task,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.020
like pushing ping-pong balls off
a table or something like that.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.800
That's just constraint
optimization.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.050
It's got nothing to
do with economics,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.930
but it's constrained
optimization.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.560
So just think of microeconomics
as like engineering,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.800
but actually interesting.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.550
So think of microeconomics
as engineering,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.000
but instead of
building something

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.750
to push a ping-pong ball
off tables, you actually

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.030
build people's lives,
and businesses,

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.233
and understand the decisions
that drive our economy.

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:05.650
So same principles
you could think

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.410
of for your engineering classes,
but applied to people's lives.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.827
And that's why, in fact, modern
economics was born in this

00:07:10.827 --> 00:07:15.970
room, this room or 26.100 by
Paul Samuelson in the 1940s

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.630
and '50s, who wrote the
fundamental textbook that gave

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.250
birth to modern economics.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.680
Because he was here and
applied the kind of engineering

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.080
principles of MIT
to actually develop

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.580
the field of modern economics.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.470
What we'll learn today
was developed at MIT,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.820
so it's a great place
to be learning it.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.040
Now, with that as background--
any questions about that,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.560
about what is microeconomics?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.780
With that as
background, let's turn

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.920
to our first model we'll talk
about this semester, which

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.330
is the supply and demand model.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.750
Supply and demand--
now, the way we're

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.800
going to proceed in this course
is going to drive you crazy,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.500
because we're going to
proceed by teaching,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.210
as the very first
question pointed out,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.930
by teaching very
simplified models.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.210
We're going to essentially--
what is a model?

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.800
A model is technically
a description

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.830
between any two or more economic
variables or any two or more

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.960
variables.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.530
But unlike the models used
in all your other classes,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.115
these aren't laws, by and
large, they're models.

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:28.240
So we don't have a relation
between energy and mass

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.282
which you can write down.

00:08:29.282 --> 00:08:30.790
It's a law and you're done.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.260
We have models which are
never 100% true, but always

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.299
pretty true, "pretty"
being somewhere

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.900
between 10% and 95% true.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.650
So basically, the idea
is to make a trade-off.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.750
We want to write
down in our models

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.480
a set of simplifying
assumptions that

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.050
allow us, with a relatively
small set of steps,

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.790
to capture relatively
broad phenomena.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.800
So it's essentially a trade-off.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.690
On the one hand,
we'd like a model

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.480
that captures as well as
possible the phenomena

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.470
in the real world, like
E equals Mc squared.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.230
But we want to do so in the
most tractable possible way

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.150
so that we can teach it
from first principles,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:20.930
and don't need an arrow to teach
every single insight we have.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.600
So basically in
economics, we tend

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.007
to resolve that by erring
on the side of tractability.

00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:29.840
That is why I can teach
you the entire field

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.862
of microeconomics--
which is really sort of--

00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:33.320
macro is kind of
a fun application.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.507
Micro is really economics.

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.590
I can teach you the entire
field of microeconomics

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.150
in the semester,
because I'm going

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.730
to make a whole huge set
of simplifying assumptions

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.160
to make things tractable.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.710
But the key thing
is that you will

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.650
be amazed at what these
models will be able to do.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.065
With a fairly simple
set of models,

00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:52.940
we will be able to offer
insights and explain

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.340
a whole huge variety
of phenomena,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.980
never perfectly, but
always pretty well,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.260
generally pretty well.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.940
And so that is
essentially the trade-off

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.950
we're going to try
to do this semester.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.860
So the line I like
is the statistician

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.810
George Box said that all models
are wrong, but some are useful.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.230
Now obviously, it doesn't apply
to models in the hard sciences,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.830
but in the social
sciences, that's true.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.420
And basically, I'm
going to write down

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.160
a set of models like that.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.070
Now, with every model I write
down, I'm going to try--

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.630
my goal is to have you
understand it at three levels.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.420
The first and most
important level

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.750
is the intuitive
level, the level

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.340
which you sort of understand.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.213
I call it "passing
the Mom Test."

00:10:36.213 --> 00:10:38.630
You can go home and explain
it to your mom at Thanksgiving

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.910
or at the end of semester.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.032
No offense to dads, just
called it "the Mom Test."

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:45.740
So basically, that's
the intuitive level.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.590
You really understand it in a
way that you could explain it.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.703
The second is graphical.

00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:52.370
We were going to do--
most of our models

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.490
here were developed in a
graphical framework using

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:00.250
x/y graphs that really in
economics, we think delivers

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.020
a lot of shorthand power.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.478
And the third is mathematical.

00:11:04.478 --> 00:11:06.520
The mathematical is probably
the least important,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.510
but it's the easiest
to test you on.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:14.200
So we're going to need to know
things mathematically as well.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.430
So let's start by considering
the supply and demand

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.000
model by using
the famous example

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.920
brought up by Adam Smith.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.463
Adam Smith is sort of considered
the father of economics.

00:11:26.463 --> 00:11:28.630
If Paul Samuelson is the
father of modern economics,

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.550
Adam Smith is the
father of all economics.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.700
His 1776 book, The
Wealth of Nations

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.100
did an incredible job
of actually laying out

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.070
the entire core of
the economics field--

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.750
no math, just words,
but he just nailed it.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.400
And one of his most
famous examples

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.340
was the water diamond paradox.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.110
He said, think about
water and diamonds.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.193
He said, start with water.

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.110
Nothing is more important
for life than water.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.860
It's the building
block of all of life.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.910
Even when we look for
life on other planets,

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.080
we always start by
looking for water.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.450
Now think of diamonds, one
of the more frivolous things

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.990
you can buy, certainly
irrelevant to leading

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.010
a successful or happy or
productive life, or any life.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.550
Yet for most of us,
water's free and diamonds

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.800
are super expensive.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.140
How can this be,
Adam Smith asked.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.560
Well, the answer he posed is
that what I first described

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.940
was just demand.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.800
That is, we demand
lots of water.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.590
We demand fewer diamonds.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.860
But we have to match that
with the concept of supply.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.870
And the supply of water
is almost infinite,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.110
while the supply of diamonds--
maybe not naturally,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.480
maybe it's through decisions
of various businesses--

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.410
but it's somewhat limited.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.700
So basically what
he developed is

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.000
what we call the "supply
and demand scissors"--

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.730
that you can't just think of
supply or demand in isolation.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.680
You have to put
them together if you

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.920
want to explain the real world
phenomena we see, like the fact

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.150
that water is cheap and
diamonds are expensive.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.663
So let's just about an example.

00:13:02.663 --> 00:13:04.330
So there's one graph
that was handed out

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.570
in the back, which
is, let's talk

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.695
about the market for roses.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:18.580
So in the market for roses,
we have a demand curve

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.503
and a supply curve.

00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:21.670
So what we have here-- this
is the kind of x/y graph

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.310
we're going to look at all
throughout the semester.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.880
On the x-axis is the
quantity of roses.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.610
On the y-axis is
the price of roses.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.580
The blue, downward-sloping
line is the demand curve.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.550
Now, what I'm going to do here,
I'm just giving you a overview.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.720
We are going, over the next
five or six lectures, dive

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.180
into where this demand
curve comes from.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.388
We'll go to first principles
and build it back up.

00:13:47.388 --> 00:13:48.930
But for now, what
we know of a demand

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.040
curve is it simply
represents the relationship

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.620
between the price of a good
and how much people want it.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.440
Therefore, we assume
it is downward sloping.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.500
At higher prices, people
want less of the good.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.660
And we'll derive where
that comes from shortly,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.110
starting next lecture.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.550
But for now, I think
it's pretty intuitive

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.450
that if the price
of roses is higher,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.710
people want fewer of them.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.650
And that's why it's
downward sloping.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.960
Basically, as the
price of roses goes up,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.750
people want fewer roses.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.030
The yellow curve is
the supply curve.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.780
Now, after we've derived
the demand curve,

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.877
we'll then go and
spend about 12 lectures

00:14:27.877 --> 00:14:28.960
deriving the supply curve.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.793
That's a bit harder.

00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:31.835
But once again, we'll
start from first principles

00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:32.860
and build it up.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.050
For now, you just need to
know that's how much firms

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.510
are willing to supply,
given the price.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.180
So basically, as
the price goes up,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.210
firms want to
produce more roses.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.290
The higher price means
you make more money,

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.560
so you want to
produce more of them.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.960
This is slightly less
intuitive than demand,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.195
but we'll derive it and
explain how it can be.

00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:54.070
But for now, just go
with the basic intuition

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.985
that if you're making
something, and you can sell it

00:14:55.985 --> 00:14:57.360
in the market for
a higher price,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.390
you're going to want
to make more of it.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.780
And that leads to the
upward sloping supply curve.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.180
Where the points meet is
the market equilibrium.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.870
Where supply and demand meets
is the market equilibrium.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.910
And that is the point where
both consumers and producers are

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.430
happy to make a transaction.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.180
Consumers are happy because
on their demand curve

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.770
is the $3 and 600 roses.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.667
That is, they are willing
to buy 600 roses at $3.

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.500
Producers are happy,
because on their supply

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.150
curve is the same point.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.110
They are willing to
supply 600 roses at $3.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.020
That is the one point
where consumers are happy

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.490
and producers are happy.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.930
Therefore, it's
the equilibrium--

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.762
highly non-technical, but
that's the basic intuition.

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:51.720
The point at which they're
both willing to make

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.890
that transaction, the
point at which they're

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.810
both satisfied with
that transaction,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.630
is the equilibrium, which
in this case is $3 per

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.120
rose and 600 roses.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.008
Now, this raises
lots of questions.

00:16:02.008 --> 00:16:03.300
Where did the curves come from?

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.880
How does equilibrium
get achieved?

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.290
Why the heck do we give roses?

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.700
These are a bunch of questions.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.880
We will come to
all these questions

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.220
over the next set of lectures.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.750
But the basic thing
is to understand

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.875
this intuition of Adam Smith's
supply and demand model.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:20.750
Questions about that?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:31.035
Now, this model also raises
another important distinction

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:32.410
that we'll focus
on this semester

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.000
and is easy to get mixed up.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.770
So I want you to, if
you're ever unclear,

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.240
I want you to ask me about it.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.080
And that's the distinction
between positive

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:50.280
versus normative analyses--
positive versus normative.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.550
Positive analysis is the
study of the way things are,

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.970
while normative
analyses is the study

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.050
of the way things should be.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.810
A positive analysis is the
study of the way things are,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.880
while normative
analysis is the study

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.040
of the way things should be.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:14.160
Let me give you a great
example, which is eBay auctions.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.950
Auctions are a terrific example.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.410
They're like the
textbook example

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.660
of a competitive market.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.920
You can see it in your head--

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.640
demand comes as a bunch of
people going on and bidding.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.599
People who want
it more bid more,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.460
so you actually
get a demand curve.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.400
The higher the price, the fewer
people you're getting to bid.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.210
Supply is how many units
of it are for sale on eBay.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.120
You bid until those two meet.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.340
And then you have a
market equilibrium

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.490
at that bidded price.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.450
Now, one example
of an eBay auction

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.190
that got a lot of attention
a number of years ago,

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.610
early in the days
of eBay, was someone

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.292
offered their
kidney for auction.

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:54.750
They said, look,
I got two kidneys.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.675
You only need one to live.

00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:57.550
There are people out
there who need a kidney.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.330
I'm putting my kidney
on eBay for auction.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.160
And what happened,
bidding went nuts.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.960
It started at $25,000.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.130
It climbed to $5 million before
the auction was shut down,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.820
and eBay decided
they wouldn't allow

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.150
you to sell your body on
eBay, bodily parts on eBay.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.310
So this raises two questions.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.820
The first is the
positive question,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.542
why did the price go so high?

00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:24.750
So what's the answer to that?

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.692
What's the answer to
the positive question?

00:18:26.692 --> 00:18:29.195
AUDIENCE: Somebody
wanted a kidney.

00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: Good
answer, but let's raise hands

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.040
and give answers.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.940
That's part of it.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.004
Yeah.

00:18:34.004 --> 00:18:34.830
AUDIENCE: Low
supply, high demand.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.538
JONATHAN GRUBER: Low
supply, high demand.

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:38.978
Demand is incredibly high,
because I'd die without it.

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:40.770
Supply is low, because
like not a lot of us

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.145
are willing to
sell their kidneys

00:18:42.145 --> 00:18:47.490
on eBay So low supply, high
demand led to a high price--

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.820
Adam Smith at work.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.200
That's the positive analysis.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.990
But then there's the
normative question, which is,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.130
should you be allowed to
sell your kidneys on eBay?

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.380
That's the normative question.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.280
The positive question is,
what happens if you do?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.150
The normative question
is, should you?

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:11.000
Now, the standard
economics answer to start

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.820
would be, of course you should.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.370
We're in a world where
thousands of people

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.310
die every year because there's
a waiting list for a kidney

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.385
transplant.

00:19:22.385 --> 00:19:24.760
and these are people who would
happily pay a lot of money

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.580
to stay alive, I presume.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.880
Meanwhile, there's
hundreds of millions

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.610
of people walking around with
two kidneys who only need one.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.980
And many of these
people are poor.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.500
And lives could be changed
by being paid $1 million

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.292
for their kidney, and might be
happy to take the risk that one

00:19:45.292 --> 00:19:47.250
kidney will be fine, as
it is for most everyone

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.230
for most of their
life, in return

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.650
for having a life-changing
payment from a stranger.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.700
So economists say, look--

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.240
here's a transaction that
makes both parties better off.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.150
The person who gets the
kidney gets to stay alive,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.180
and they are willing to
pay a huge amount for that.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.880
The person who sells the
kidney in most probability

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.723
is fine, because
almost all of us

00:20:07.723 --> 00:20:09.640
can make it through life
fine with one kidney,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.940
and create a life-changing
amount of money that

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.650
could allow them to pursue
their dreams in various ways.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.350
So that's the standard
argument, would be,

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.700
yeah, you should be able to
sell your kidneys on eBay.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.070
So the question is, why not?

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.420
Why would we want to
stop this transaction?

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.020
What are the
counter-arguments to that?

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.950
Let's raise our hands.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.170
Yeah.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.400
AUDIENCE: Potentially, I
think maybe the issue is

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.850
because on eBay, there's
no way to regulate it

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.810
or you don't necessarily know.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.942
People could be like selling
fake kidneys, per se.

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:42.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.030
So the first type
of problem comes out

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.000
of the category we
call "market failures."

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.730
Market failures are reasons
why the market doesn't

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.260
work in the wonderful
way economists

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.370
like to think it should.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.710
So for example,
this answer puts up

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.570
there could be the
problem of fraud.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.890
People might not be
able to tell if they're

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.010
getting a legit kidney or not.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.092
There could be the example
of imperfect information.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.640
Do you know what the
odds are that you

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.270
can spend the rest of your
life with only one kidney?

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.370
I don't either.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.080
We ought to know that before
we start selling our kidneys.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.820
There could be
imperfect information.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.780
This is one type of problem,
which is the market,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.390
maybe the market may fail.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.940
Yeah.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.510
AUDIENCE: Well, the
current system also

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.590
holds people who are poor
and have a failed kidney--

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.590
and which are people who would
be completely screwed otherwise

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.290
in the [INAUDIBLE] system.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.030
JONATHAN GRUBER:
A second problem

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.850
is what we call
"equity" or "fairness."

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.440
Equity or fairness, which is
we would end up with a world

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.470
where only rich people
would get kidneys.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.560
Currently, there's a bunch of
voluntary donors and people

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.800
who are in accidents who
have kidneys left over.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.750
And those go to people
on the basis of where

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.440
they are on a waiting list.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.400
It's actually a
prioritized waiting list.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.480
It's kind of a cool--

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.480
one of my colleagues, Nikhil
Agarwal, if you think about--

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.390
I'll talk a lot this semester
about the imperialistic view

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.880
of economics, all the
cool things we can study.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.280
So he actually uses
economic models

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.360
to study the optimal way to
allocate organs to individuals.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.600
now it's just done
based on a waiting list,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.240
but it may be that someone
further down the waiting

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.010
list needs it more than someone
higher up the waiting list

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.220
because they're more
critical or whatever.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.053
So there's various
optimal ways to allocate.

00:22:47.053 --> 00:22:48.803
But certainly, the
optimal way to allocate

00:22:48.803 --> 00:22:50.580
wouldn't be the rich
guy gets it first.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.610
That would be unlikely to be
what society would necessarily

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.410
want.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.890
So there's an equity
concern with that.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.410
What else?

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.102
What other-- yeah.

00:23:00.102 --> 00:23:02.520
AUDIENCE: In that
situation, since you

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.680
know you can make money
off of selling kidneys,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.420
and you take advantage
of people, it's very bad,

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.113
the black market for kidneys.

00:23:09.113 --> 00:23:11.280
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right, so
there's sort of a third--

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.697
it's related to
fraud, but there's

00:23:12.697 --> 00:23:14.490
sort of a third
class of failures

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.300
that gets into the question
about behavioral economics

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.682
that was raised earlier, which
we could just call behavioral--

00:23:23.682 --> 00:23:25.140
it's called
"behavioral economics,"

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.680
for want of a better term,
which is essentially,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.200
people don't always
make decisions

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.900
in the perfectly rational,
logical way we will model them

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.140
as doing so this semester.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.490
People make mistakes.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.700
That's a word we hate
using in economics.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.783
We hate saying "mistakes."

00:23:39.783 --> 00:23:42.110
Ooh, boo, mistakes--
nobody makes mistakes.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.610
We're all perfectly
economic beings.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.290
But we know that's not true.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.723
Increasingly over the
past several decades,

00:23:47.723 --> 00:23:49.640
economists have started
incorporating insights

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.812
from psychology into our
models, to not just say

00:23:53.812 --> 00:23:55.770
people make mistakes,
that their lackadaisical,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.190
but to rigorously model the
nature of those mistakes

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.070
and understand how
mistakes can actually

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.300
happen due to various cognitive
biases and other things.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.940
In this world, you can imagine
people could make mistakes.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.100
They could not really
sit down and quite

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.048
understand what
they're doing, and they

00:24:13.048 --> 00:24:15.090
could have sold their
kidney when it's really not

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.300
in their own long-term interest.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.880
Yeah.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.670
AUDIENCE: Would
another example be

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.967
if there's a family that
is in extreme poverty,

00:24:20.967 --> 00:24:22.550
even though they
only have one kidney,

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.060
they might sell the other
one, just to get more

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.650
money for the family, per se?

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.970
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, in
some sense that would be,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.280
once again--

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.700
if we took this factor out,
if the market works well

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.700
with its behavioral
effects, we'd say, you know,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.350
that's their decision.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.550
If they otherwise they
starve, who are you to say?

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.950
But once you choose
this, say, wait a second,

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.200
maybe they're not evaluating
the trade-offs correctly.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.840
Even if there's no fraud, even
if there's perfect information,

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.552
they may not know how to process
that information correctly.

00:24:51.552 --> 00:24:53.010
But that is not
standard economics.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.552
That's not what we'll spend a
lot of time on in the semester,

00:24:55.552 --> 00:24:58.270
but it's obviously realistic.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.750
So those are a bunch of good
comments, great comments.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.790
And yeah.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.050
AUDIENCE: Also, in
inelastic demand,

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.042
such that people
always need kidneys--

00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:09.250
JONATHAN GRUBER: That won't
turn out to be a problem.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.562
That doesn't turn
out to be a problem.

00:25:11.562 --> 00:25:13.270
We'll come back--
that's a great comeback

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.010
that we talk about the
shape of demand curves.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.570
We want to return to that
question in a few lectures,

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:18.400
but that doesn't
actually cause a problem.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.110
It's just that's more of
a positive thing about why

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.570
the price is so high, but it's
not a normative issue about

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.240
whether you should
allow it or not.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.450
So basically,
these are exactly--

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.460
to me, honestly, I spend
my life thinking a lot

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.252
about these things.

00:25:31.252 --> 00:25:33.110
I think these are really
interesting issues.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.990
But you can't get to
the normative issues

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.740
without the positive analysis.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.890
You do the positive
analysis to understand

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.050
the economic framework
before you start

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.670
jumping to drawing conclusions.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:43.390
That's no fun.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.900
We all want to jump
to draw conclusions,

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.390
saying this should happen,
this shouldn't happen.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.140
You can't do that.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.890
We have to be disciplined.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.240
We have to start with the
fundamental economic framework.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.908
And basically, the bottom line--

00:25:55.908 --> 00:25:57.950
I said I'll teach this
course with a policy bent,

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.530
but you have to recognize
that economics at its core

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.630
is a right-wing science.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.910
Economics at its
core is all about how

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:09.390
the market knows best, and that
basically governments only mess

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.490
things up.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.497
That's sort of the
basic, a lot of what

00:26:13.497 --> 00:26:14.580
we'll learn this semester.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.038
As the semester
goes on, we'll talk

00:26:16.038 --> 00:26:17.670
about what's wrong
with that view

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.900
and how governments
can improve things.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.067
Indeed, I teach a whole
course about the proper role

00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:22.600
of government the economy.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.460
But the standard of economics
is, "the market knows best."

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.670
And that leads us to the last
thing I want to talk about,

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.330
which is basically, how freely
should an economy function?

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.305
Let's step back to
the giant picture.

00:26:35.305 --> 00:26:36.930
Let's step back from
a market for roses

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.760
to the entire economy.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.000
How freely should a market,
should an economy function?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.740
We have what's known as
a "capitalistic economy."

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.770
In a capitalistic economy,
firms and individuals

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.080
decide what to
produce and consume,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.090
maybe subject to some rules of
the road set by the government.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.730
There's some minimum
rules of the road

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.100
to try to avoid fraud
or misinformation,

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.110
but otherwise, we
let the dice roll.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.970
Firms let consumers
decide sort of what to do.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.770
Now, this has led to
tremendous growth.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.730
America was not
a wealthy nation,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.660
was not a very wealthy
nation 100 years ago,

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.140
or 150 years ago.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.210
Led to tremendous
growth, where we are now

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.585
the most powerful, still the
most powerful and wealthiest

00:27:18.585 --> 00:27:24.160
nation the world, largely driven
by the capitalistic nature

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.020
of our economy.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.120
On the other hand,
we are a nation

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.190
with tremendous inequality.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.720
We are by far the most unequal
major nation in the world.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.460
The top 1% of Americans has a
much higher share of our income

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.500
than in any other large
country in the world,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.830
any other large developed
country in the world.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.830
The bottom 99% has less of
our income corresponding

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.970
with anywhere else.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.910
So it's led to major inequality.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.420
And it's led to other problems.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.970
It turns out that the
government can't appropriately

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.460
set the rules of the road to
avoid things like fraud, as we

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.890
saw with Enron, if you
remember back to that,

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.320
or a lot of what happened
in the financial meltdown.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.820
It turns out it's
hard to get people

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.395
perfect information, et cetera.

00:28:05.395 --> 00:28:06.520
So we've seen the problems.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.650
We've grown very
wealthy as a nation.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.230
We've introduced a whole set of
problems through this system.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.390
Now, the other extreme is what's
called the "command economy."

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.160
Rather than a
capitalist economy,

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.370
it's what's called
a "command economy."

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.820
In this case, the government
makes all the production

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.960
and consumption decisions.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.210
The government doesn't just
set the rules of the road,

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.460
the government owns the road.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.710
The government says, we're
going to use this many cars

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.200
this year.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.770
And people can get
them in some way.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.770
It could be a lottery,
could be waiting in line.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.510
How do we decide how
to allocate them?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.890
We're not going to let
the market allocate them.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.515
We, the government,
will allocate them.

00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:47.230
We'll allocate how many get
produced and who gets them.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.980
And this was the model
of the Soviet Union

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.630
that I grew up with.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.670
This was the pre-1989
Soviet Union.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.410
The government decided how many
shirts, cars, TVs, everything.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.243
It's sort of bizarre
to think that literally

00:29:00.243 --> 00:29:03.363
everything the government
decided how much to produce.

00:29:03.363 --> 00:29:05.780
And by and large, the government
decided who got it partly

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.690
through corruption-- that
is, the party members,

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.130
party leaders got it first--

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.950
and often just through waiting
in line for the remaining

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.870
application.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.960
Now in theory,
this ensured equity

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.450
by making sure that
everybody had shot at things.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.790
In practice, it didn't
work well at all

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.470
and actually was
what dragged down

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.810
the collapse of the
old Soviet economy,

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:30.550
was that the command
model simply doesn't work.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.850
Partly there's just too many
opportunities for corruption.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.530
When the government
controls everything,

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:40.150
that means there's no checks
and balances on the opportunity

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.490
for enormous corruption.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.990
The capitalist economy puts
some natural checks and balances

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.560
on that.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.380
And partly because it
turns out that it's

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.150
hard to control human nature.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.980
And Adam Smith had it right.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.680
Adam Smith talks about
the "invisible hand"

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.150
of the capitalist economy.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.115
The invisible hand is
basically the notion

00:29:59.115 --> 00:30:00.740
that the capitalist
economy will manage

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.510
to distribute things roughly in
proportion to what people want.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.910
And that's where
folks want to be.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.470
Folks who want a
certain kind of car

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.120
are going to want to
get to that kind of car,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.680
and if the government
has it wrong,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.805
they're going to get upset.

00:30:13.805 --> 00:30:17.850
And it's going to lead to
a less functional economy.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.590
So basically, Adam
Smith's view is that--

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.250
the invisible hand view is that
consumers and firms serving

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:31.080
their own best interest will
do what is best for society.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.510
So the fundamental core
of the capitalistic view

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:37.770
is that consumers and firms
serving their own best interest

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.207
will do what ends up
being best for society.

00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:41.790
And that's essentially
the model we'll

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.940
learn to start in this course.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.890
Yeah.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.390
AUDIENCE: In that
definition, are we

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:51.680
defining the best for
society as in everybody

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.120
has the most money?

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.892
Or everyone has the best health
or the best standard of living?

00:30:56.892 --> 00:30:58.100
What is the best [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.830
JONATHAN GRUBER: Great question.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.170
We're going to spend a lot
of the semester talking

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.100
about that.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.650
For now, we're going to
define "best for society"

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.062
as the most stuff gets
produced and consumed.

00:31:07.062 --> 00:31:08.520
That's how we're
going to find it--

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.312
obviously raises a set
of issues about what

00:31:10.312 --> 00:31:13.120
about pollution, what
about health, et cetera.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.630
We're going to come to those,
but for the first two-thirds

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.630
of the course "best
for society" means

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.270
what we're going to call
"maximum surplus," which

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.230
is the most stuff gets
produced that people value.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.730
So that's how we're
going to do it.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.647
And in his view, the
invisible hand does that.

00:31:28.647 --> 00:31:35.730
And by and large, it's a very
helpful framework to turn to.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.890
However, at least it
can lead to outcomes

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.730
that are not very fair.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.060
So the way we're going
to proceed in this course

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.550
is we're going to start
by talking about how

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.290
Adam Smith's magic works.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.880
How does the magic happen?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.800
How does individuals
and firms acting

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.950
in their own self-interest,
without caring about anybody

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:58.530
else, end up yielding
the largest possible

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.750
productive economy?

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.442
How does that happen?

00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:03.900
And we're going to
talk about that.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.940
We'll start with
demand, which is

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.560
how do consumers
decide what they

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.120
want given their resources.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.805
We'll talk about the principle
of utility maximization,

00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:14.430
the idea that I have
a utility function

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.300
that I can mathematically
write down what I want.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.940
I'll have a budget constraint,
which is the resources I have,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.950
and those two
constrain optimization.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.258
We'll say given what I want
and the resource I have,

00:32:25.258 --> 00:32:26.300
what decisions do I make?

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.280
Boom, we get the demand curve.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.280
Then we'll turn to supply, and
we'll talk about how do firms

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.368
decide what to produce.

00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:35.160
That's much more
complicated, because firms

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.030
have to decide
what inputs to use

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.560
and what outputs to produce.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.510
And we'll talk about
how firms can operate

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.230
in very different markets.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.710
There is a competitive market
that Adam Smith envisioned,

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:47.918
but that doesn't always work.

00:32:47.918 --> 00:32:50.490
Sometimes we get
monopoly markets,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.713
where one firm dominates.

00:32:51.713 --> 00:32:53.130
And you can actually
have outcomes

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.080
which aren't the best
possible outcome, even

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.290
with the invisible hand.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.860
So we'll talk about
different kinds of markets.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.830
Then we'll put it together
to get market equilibrium,

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.900
and talk about
Smith's principles.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.780
And then from there, we'll
talk about how it breaks down

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.940
in reality, different
change in reality,

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.310
how there are various
market failures that

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.710
can get in the way, why we
have to care about equity

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.830
and what implications that has,
about behavioral economics,

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.260
about a set of other factors.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.930
So that's basically how we're
going to proceed this semester.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.960
As I said, the
lectures are important,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.060
but the recitations are as well.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.950
Once we're sort of
in steady state,

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.690
the recitations will be about
half new material and half

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.760
working through problems
to help you prepare

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.855
for that next problem set.

00:33:37.855 --> 00:33:39.730
So the way the problem
sets are going to work

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.670
is the problem set
that's assigned

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.663
will cover material that's
taught up to that date.

00:33:44.663 --> 00:33:46.330
So for example, problem
set one is going

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.887
to be assigned next Friday.

00:33:47.887 --> 00:33:49.720
That will cover everything
you've learned up

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.690
through next Wednesday.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.340
Therefore, in section
on next Friday,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.312
we'll do a practice problem
which you should understand

00:33:57.312 --> 00:33:59.520
because it'll cover things
that were taught in class,

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.103
and help prepare you
for the problems.

00:34:01.103 --> 00:34:02.460
And we'll do that every week.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.770
That's about half the section.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.280
The other half of the
section will be new material.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.849
This Friday, the section on
Friday is all new material.

00:34:08.849 --> 00:34:11.170
What we do on Friday is
cover the mathematics.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.620
I don't like doing math.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.050
I always get it wrong.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.110
So I leave math for the TAs,
who are smarter than I am.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.630
So this Friday, we'll be doing
the mathematics of supply

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.018
and demand, and how you
take the intuition here

00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:23.560
and the simple
graphics, and actually

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.380
turn it into mathematical
representations, which is what

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.790
you need for the problem sets.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:28.780
That's this Friday.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.447
Then we'll come back
on Monday and start

00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:32.889
talking about what's
underneath the demand curve.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.010
All right, any other questions?

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.860
I'll see you on Monday.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.890
LORNA GIBSON: OK,
so it's five after.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.820
We should probably start.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.999
So last time we were
talking about honeycombs,

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.790
and I just wanted to
quickly kind of review

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.623
what we had talked
about, and then today I'm

00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:39.610
going to start
deriving equations

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.850
for the mechanical properties
of the honeycombs, OK?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.290
So this is a slide of
our honeycomb setup here.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.170
These are the hexagonal
cells we're going to look at.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.000
We talked about the
stress-strain behavior.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.120
The curves on the left-hand
side are for compression

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.752
and the ones on the right-hand
side are for tension.

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:57.460
And so what we're
going to be doing today

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.500
is we're going to start out by
calculating a Young's modulus,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.950
this slope here.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.830
We're going to calculate the
stress plateaus for failure

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.850
by elastic buckling in
elastomeric honeycombs,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.120
by failure from plastic yielding
in, say, a metal honeycomb,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.350
and by failure by
a brittle crushing

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.984
in, say, a ceramic honeycomb.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:18.150
And if we have time, we'll
get to the tension stuff.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.320
I don't know if we'll get
to that today or next time.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.778
So we're going to
start calculating

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:22.900
those properties today.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.650
And these were the
deformation mechanisms.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.150
Remember, we said the linear
elastic behavior was related

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.890
to bending of the cell
walls, and then the plateau

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.530
was related to buckling
if it was an elastomer.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.460
And the plateau was
related to yielding

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.889
if it was, say, a metal
that had a yield point.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.430
And then this was
sort of an overview

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.846
of the stress-strain
curve showing

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:42.674
those different regions, OK?

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:44.590
So what I'm going to
talk about today to start

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.744
is the linear elastic behavior.

00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:49.160
And we're going to be starting
with the in-plane behavior.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.730
So in-plane means in the
plane of the hexagonal cells.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.860
And then next time we'll do the
out-of-plane behavior, this way

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.376
on.

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:58.000
So if I had to form
my little honeycomb

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.130
like this, what
initially happens

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.530
is the inclined cell walls bend.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.050
So if you can see over
here, we've kind of

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.970
exaggerated it on this sketch.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.490
So this wall here is bent.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.220
This one here just kind of
moves along, goes for the ride.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.410
And this guy here is bent.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.050
So this is for
loading in the what

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.590
we're calling the x1
direction, sigma 1.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.030
And the same kind
of thing happens

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.530
when we load in the
other direction,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.510
in the sigma 2 direction,
these guys still bend.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.590
Now the honeycomb
gets wider that way.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.690
It gets shorter this
way, wider that way.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.090
And we can calculate
the Young's modulus

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.310
if we can relate the load
on the beam in the moments

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.950
to this deflection here, right?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.610
So the Young's modulus is going
to be related to the stiffness

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.367
and the stiffness is going to be
related to how much deformation

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.950
you get for a certain amount of
load that you put on the beam.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.730
So I'm going to calculate the
modulus for the x1 direction,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.590
the thing on the left there.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.822
And you can do the same
thing for the x2 direction

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:52.280
on the right, but
I won't calculate

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.880
that because it's exactly
the same kind of process.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.199
OK, so let me start here.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.740
Get my chalk.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.863
So I'm going to draw
a one-unit cell here.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.660
So here's my unit
cell there, like that.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.220
And this member
here is of length h.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.360
That member there
is of length l.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.270
That angle there is theta.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.560
I'm going to say all the
walls have equal thickness,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.630
and I'm going to call it t.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.000
And I'm going to define an
x1 and x2 axis like this.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.130
So the horizontal is x1 and
the vertical axis is x2.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.580
And I'm going to say that I
apply a sort of global stress

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.380
to it, sigma 1.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.395
So there's a stress in the one
direction there, sigma 1, OK?

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.270
And I'm going to say my
honeycomb has a depth

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.530
b into the page,
but the depth s--

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.622
is because the
honeycomb's prismatic,

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.080
the b's are always going to
cancel out of all the equations

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.010
that we're going to get,
because everything's

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.330
uniform in that direction.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.000
And we can think about
a unit cell here,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.170
and in the x1
direction, we could

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:24.700
say the length of our
unit cell is 2l cos theta.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.820
So in the x1 direction,
that's our unit cell there,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.296
and that's 2l cos of theta.

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:37.020
And in the x2
direction, you might

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.950
think that you go
from this vertex

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.150
up here down to
that vertex there,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.950
but if you did that, then
on the next layer of cells,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.440
you wouldn't have
the same distance.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.880
So the unit length
in the x2 direction

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.074
is actually from here
to here, and then you

00:04:54.074 --> 00:04:56.240
can see the next cell, you
would get the same thing.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.440
You get this bit here
from the inclined member,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.400
and then you would get h down
here from the next member.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.240
So this bit here is equal to
h plus l times sine of theta.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.142
So I can say in
the x2 direction,

00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:18.870
the length of the unit cell
is h plus l sine theta, OK?

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.230
So that's kind of the setup.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.874
And then what we want to look
at is that inclined member

00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:25.290
that bends, we
want to look at how

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.080
this guy bends under the load.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.290
And if we can relate the
forces on it to the deflection,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.830
and we need the component
of the deflection in the one

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.940
direction, then we're going
to be able to get the modulus.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.020
So I'm going to draw that
inclined member again

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.210
over here, and it's
going to see some loads

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.240
that I'm going to call
p, and that's going

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.620
to cause this thing to bend.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.840
So I've kind of exaggerated it
there, but there's the bending.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.540
And there's some end
deflection there, delta.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.910
And there's moments at either
end of the beam, or either end

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.590
of that member, as well.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.420
And this member
here has a length.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.040
That length is l.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.570
OK, are we good?

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.030
So it's just kind of the setup.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.900
And I'm going to
draw the deflection

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.730
delta bigger over here.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.190
So say that's delta.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.360
That's the same parallel
as this guy here.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.170
What I'm going to want is the
deflection in the x1 direction,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.900
and when I come to calculate
the Poisson's ratio,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.820
I'm going to want the
deflection in the x2 direction.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.360
And if this angle here is
theta, between the horizontal

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.820
and the inclined member,
then this angle up here

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.780
is also theta, and so this
bit here is delta sine theta.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.350
And this bit here
is delta cos theta.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.130
Ba-doop-ba-doop-ba-doop.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.230
So the Young's
modulus is going to be

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.210
the stress in the
one direction divided

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.000
by the strain in
the one direction.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.050
So I need to get the
stress and the strain

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.890
in the one direction.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.020
So here the stress
in the one direction.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.020
If I'm applying my load,
like this, sigma 1,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.920
the stress in the
one direction is

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.130
going to be this load
p-- so this load,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.530
say, p on this member here,
divided by this length

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.300
here, the unit cell
length, and then

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.830
divided by b into the board,
the width end of the board.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:40.600
So sigma 1 is going to be p
divided by h plus l sine theta

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.337
times b.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.580
And epsilon 1 is going to be
the strain in the one direction,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.120
is going to be the deformation
in the one direction divided

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.380
by the unit cell length
in the one direction.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:59.630
So that's going to be delta sine
theta divided by l cos theta.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.130
So here, even though I've said
this unit cell is 2l cos theta,

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.414
there'd be two of
the members here

00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:07.330
that would be twice that
deflection in the one

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.240
direction.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.480
So it's, for one beam,
it's delta sine theta

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.520
over l cos theta.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.710
Are we OK so far?

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.890
So far so good?

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.450
So for the hexagons,
because we're

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.620
going to figure out the
equations more or less exactly,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.221
we're going to keep track of
all the geometrical factors.

00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:29.720
When we come to the
foams, we're not

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.997
going to keep track of all
the geometrical factors.

00:08:31.997 --> 00:08:34.580
So one of the things that makes
us look a little kind of hairy

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.038
is just the fact
that we're keeping

00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:38.630
track of all these sines and
cosines and all the dimensions

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.802
and things.

00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:42.696
All right, whoop.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.050
So I need to be able to relate
my load p to my deformation

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.820
delta to get a stiffness out
of this, to get a modulus, OK?

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.270
So the way I do
that is, remember

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.360
in 3032, we did those
bending moment diagrams

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.280
and we did the
deflection of the beams?

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.210
This is where this
comes in handy.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.990
So I'm going to draw my beam
a little bit differently now.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.050
I'm going to turn
it on its side.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.190
So this is still my
length l, but I'm

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.410
going to turn on my
side just so that you

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.390
can see it the same
kind of way we did

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.580
the bending moment diagrams.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.620
So this is still my
length l across here.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:32.100
And there's end
moments, M and M here.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.060
And P sin theta is just
the perpendicular component

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.940
of the load p.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.260
So p sin theta is just the
component perpendicular

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.470
to my beam.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.760
So I could draw a
shear diagram here

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.070
and I could draw a bending
moment diagram here.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.830
And, if you remember,
the shear diagram,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.920
if I have no concentrated
load along here,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.200
and I have no distributed load
along here, if this is zero,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.760
down here, it's just going
to go up my P sin theta,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.590
and then be horizontal, and then
come down by P sin theta, OK?

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.300
So that's the shear diagram.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:20.614
And then the bending
moment diagram,

00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:21.780
I'm going to draw down here.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.850
So I've got some
moment at the end here,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.912
and this would tend
to bend like that.

00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:33.370
So this would be
a negative moment.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.869
Remember, bending
moments were negative

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:38.160
if there was tension on the
top, and they were positive

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.618
if there was tension
on the bottom.

00:10:39.618 --> 00:10:41.730
So over here we'd have
tension on the top,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.100
so that would give us a
negative bending moment.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.470
And then, if you also
remember, the moment

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:52.100
at a particular point is equal
to the integral from, say, A

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.760
to B-- well maybe I should
write this another way.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.460
And B minus Ma is the
integral of the shear

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.829
diagram between the two points.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.495
A little sloppy.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.020
OK.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.610
So if I know how I have
some moment here minus M,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.680
if I integrate this
shear diagram up,

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.630
then this is just going
to be linear here,

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.667
and then I'm going to
be at plus M over there.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.760
So if you look at this shear
and bending moment diagram,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.790
it's really just the
same as the shear

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.060
and bending moment diagram
for two cantilevers that

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.720
are attached to each other.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.730
So let me just draw over here
what the cantilever looks like.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.670
Let's see.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.250
So imagine I just had
a cantilever like this,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.680
and I have some force
F on it like that.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.290
And I call this
distance here capital L,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.940
and I'm going to call that
deflection capital delta,

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.500
like that.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.220
If I drew the shear
diagram for that,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.710
there'd be a reaction here, F,
there would be a moment here,

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.030
FL.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.820
Doot, doot, yup.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:18.870
So this would look-- whoops--
it's a little too long.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.730
Shear diagram here
would look like this.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.280
That would be zero.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.700
This would be FL.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.160
And the moment diagram
would look like this.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.650
Whoops.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.070
A little too long again.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.092
And that would be minus FL.

00:12:35.092 --> 00:12:36.050
And that would be zero.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.100
So do you see how the shear
and the bending moment diagram

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.710
here are really just
like two cantilevers, OK?

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:54.600
So I know that the deflection
for a cantilever, delta,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.560
is equal to F capital
L cubed over 3EI.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.800
It's kind of a standard
result. And so I

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.710
can take this and apply
that to this beam here.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.330
So instead of working everything
out from first principles,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.820
I'm just going to
say that my beam here

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.840
is like two cantilevers,
and instead of F, I've

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.770
got P sin theta.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.840
And instead of capital
L here as the length,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.889
I've got l/2 because l/2
would be the length of one

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:26.680
of the cantilevers.

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:38.700
OK, so for the
honeycomb, I've got

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:49.770
two cantilevers of length l/2.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.440
So delta for the inclined
member on the honeycomb

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.330
is going to be 2--
because I've got

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.710
two cantilevers-- the
force, instead of having F,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.930
I'm going to have P sin theta.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.280
And instead of
having capital L, I'm

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.770
going to have l/2, all cubed.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:17.990
So this is like F
capital L cubed over 3.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.400
And here, the
modulus that I want

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.040
is the modulus of the
solid cell wall material,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.140
so I'm going to call that ES,
and over the moment of inertia.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.940
So you see how I've done it?

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.370
Is that OK?

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.600
So then I can just kind of
simplify this thing here.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.580
I've got P sin theta l cubed.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.600
1/2 cubed is going to be 1/8.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.335
So this is going to be 2, if
that's 1/8, times 3 is 24.

00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:49.785
So 2/24 is 12.

00:14:52.712 --> 00:14:56.220
So I've got delta for
my honeycomb member

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.620
is P sin theta l
cubed over 12 EsI.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:08.080
And here I is the moment
of inertia of that inclined

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.540
member of the honeycomb.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.070
And that's BT cubed over 12, OK?

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.125
So B is the depth into the
board, and T is the thickness.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.990
We'll cube that
and divide by 12.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.115
It's a rectangular section.

00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:22.818
Yeah?

00:15:22.818 --> 00:15:24.424
AUDIENCE: What was ES again?

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.590
LORNA GIBSON: ES is the
Young's modulus of the solid

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.890
that it's made from.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.790
So clearly, if my
honeycomb is made up

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.900
of these members,
whatever material

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.370
the members are made of is
going to affect the stiffness

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.410
of the whole thing.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.410
Are we good?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.630
Because once we have
this part, then we just

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.260
combine these equations
for the stress

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.510
and the strain in
the one direction.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.010
And we have this equation
relating delta and P,

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.500
and we're going to be able to
get our Young's modulus, OK?

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.910
We're happy?

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.540
OK.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.390
All right.

00:16:07.206 --> 00:16:09.830
So I'm going to call the Young's
modulus in the one direction E

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.640
star 1.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.240
So everything with a star refers
to a cellular solid property,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.550
and 1 because it's
in one direction.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.030
So that's going to be
sigma 1 over epsilon 1.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.870
So if I go back up
there, I can say

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:31.550
sigma 1 is equal to P divided
by h plus l sin theta b.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:38.880
And epsilon 1 is equal to delta
sine theta in the denominator

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.030
over l cos theta.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.400
And now instead of
having delta here,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.389
I can substitute this
thing here in for delta.

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:52.430
And then I'm going to able
to cancel the P's out.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:14.430
So delta was equal to P sine
theta l cubed over 12 Es,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.160
and there was an I,
a moment of inertia,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.941
and I was equal to
bt cubed over 12.

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:23.690
And let's see here.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.329
So that's delta.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.793
And there's another
sine theta here

00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.876
so I'm just going to square
that sine theta there.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.100
So now the P's cancel out.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.195
The b's are going to cancel out.

00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:41.400
The 12s are going to cancel out.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.770
And I'm going to rearrange
this a little bit.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.640
So I'm going to
write Young's modulus

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.530
of the solid out in the front.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.660
Then I've got a
term here of t cubed

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.879
and I'm going to multiply
that by 1/l squared,

00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:58.670
and then everything
else-- well, let's see.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.620
We can take this l cubed here.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.856
I can take that.

00:18:02.856 --> 00:18:04.230
Put it underneath
that, so that's

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.000
going to give me t/l cubed.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.249
And then I've got an h
plus l sine theta here,

00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:12.790
and I've got an l
there, so I'm going

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.730
to take that to be
h/l plus sine theta.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.600
Boop-boop-da-doop.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.760
So I've got this term with
[? h/l's ?] in the thetas.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.570
There's a cos theta
from the numerator here.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.554
This term here turns
into h/l plus sine theta,

00:18:38.554 --> 00:18:40.720
and then I've got my sine
squared thetas down there.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.950
And that's my result
for the Young's modulus

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.865
in the one direction.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.500
OK?

00:18:54.452 --> 00:18:56.330
Let's make sure
that seems right.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.630
It seems good.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.700
OK.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.350
So one of the things
to notice here

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.260
is there's three types of
parameters that are important.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.230
So one is the solid properties.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.192
So the Young's modulus of
the solid comes into this.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.650
So the stiffness
of the whole thing

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.990
depends on the stiffness
of whatever it's made from.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.040
There's this factor
of t/l cubed--

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.020
that's directly related to the
relative density or the volume

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.330
fraction of solids.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.090
So what this is saying is the
relative density goes as t/l,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.230
so the Young's modulus
depends on the cube

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.230
of the relative density.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.520
So it's very sensitive
to the relative density.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.190
And then this factor
here really is just

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.069
a factor that depends
on the cell geometry.

00:19:39.069 --> 00:19:41.610
Remember when we talked about
the structure of the honeycomb,

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.770
we said we could define the cell
geometry by the ratio of h/l

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:50.160
and theta, OK?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.260
And since we often deal with
regular hexagonal honeycombs,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.030
I'm just going to
write down what

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.890
this works out to be for
regular hexagonal honeycombs.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.640
So for a regular hexagonal
honeycomb, h/l is 1.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.940
All the members have
the same length.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.300
And theta's 3, and
the modulus works out

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.510
to 4 over root 3 times
Es times t/l cubed, OK?

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.080
So do you see how
we do these things?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.460
So all the other properties
work in a similar kind of way.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.050
You have to say something about
what the sort of bulk stress

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.770
is on the whole
thing and relate that

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.880
to the loads on the members.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.559
You have to say something
about how the loads are related

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:46.600
to deflections, or when
we look at the strengths,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.860
we're going to look
at moments and how

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.480
the moments are
related to failure

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.170
moments of one sort or another.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.010
But it's all just like a
little structural analysis, OK?

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.046
Are we good?

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:56.935
You good, Teddy?

00:20:56.935 --> 00:20:58.810
I thought you were going
to put your hand up?

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.690
No?

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.210
You're OK?

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:00.710
OK.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.850
OK, so the next property
we're going to look at

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.056
is Poisson's ratio.

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:16.720
And I'm going to look at it for
loading in the one direction.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:41.029
So Poisson's 1 2, say
we load uniaxially

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:42.570
in the one direction,
we want to know

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.700
what the strain is
in the two direction,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.840
it's minus epsilon
2 over epsilon 1.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.610
And again, if I look
at my inclined member,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:56.450
and I say that member's going
to bend something like that,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:01.226
and that's my deflection
delta there, and, say,

00:22:01.226 --> 00:22:04.650
got the same x1 and x2 axes.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.112
And again, if I
look at delta here,

00:22:07.112 --> 00:22:08.980
it's the same little
sketch I had before.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.540
That's delta sine theta.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.952
And this is delta cos theta.

00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:16.660
I'm going to need
those components to get

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.920
the two strains in the
different directions.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:27.144
So epsilon 1 is going to be
delta sine theta over l cos

00:22:27.144 --> 00:22:28.380
theta.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.660
And if I'm compressing it,
that would get shorter.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:39.660
And we get-- and
epsilon 2 is going

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:49.520
to be delta cos theta divided
by h plus l sine theta.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.797
And that would get longer.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.650
So these two have
opposite signs,

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.845
and so the minus sign is
going to disappear here.

00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:07.040
Doodle-doodle-doot.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.859
So then I can get
my Poisson's ratio

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:13.650
by just taking the
ratio of those two guys.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.560
So I could put a
minus sign there

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.390
and say that's the
opposite sign to epsilon 2.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:29.820
Then this would be delta cos
theta divided by h plus l sine

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.990
theta.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:41.320
And epsilon 1 would be delta
sine theta over l cos theta.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.550
And the thing that's
convenient here

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.810
is that the two deltas
just cancel out.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.939
So the Poisson's ratio is
the ratio of two strains.

00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:51.480
Each one of the strains is going
to be proportional to delta,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.170
and so the two deltas are
just going to cancel out.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.080
And so I can rewrite
this thing here

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:04.810
as cos squared theta
divided by h/l plus sine

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:10.980
theta times sine theta.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.480
And so one of the
interesting things

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.370
to notice that the
Poisson's ratio only

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.070
depends on the cell geometry.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.380
It doesn't depend on what solid
the material is made from.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.550
It doesn't depend on
the relative density.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.015
It only depends on
the cell geometry.

00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:49.887
Oops.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.270
OK, and then we
can also work out

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.925
what the value is for a
regular hexagonal cell.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:41.790
And if we plug-in h is equal
to l and theta's equal to 30,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.670
you get that it's equal to 1.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.140
So one is kind of an unusual
number for a Poisson's ratio.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.320
When we think of most
materials, it's around 0.3,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.444
so it's kind of unusual
that it's that large.

00:25:52.444 --> 00:25:53.860
The other thing
that's interesting

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.950
is that it can be negative.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.675
So if theta is less than 0, then
you can get a negative value.

00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:12.880
If the cos squared is going
to be a positive value,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.500
but you've got a sine theta
down here, then that's going

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.610
to give you a negative value.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.000
So you can get negative values.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.280
So let me just
plug in an example.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.020
So say h/l is equal
to 2, and theta

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:36.170
is equal to minus 30 degrees,
then this turns out to be 3/4.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:41.850
So cos of 30 is root 3/2,
so square of that is 3/4.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.510
h/l is 2, sine theta is
1/2, but it's minus 1/2.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.950
So 2 minus 1/2 is 1 and 1/2.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.810
And then the sine
theta is minus 1/2.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.380
And so it works
out to be minus 1

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.040
for that particular combination.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.800
And I brought my
little honeycomb

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.480
that has a negative
Poisson's ratio in.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.079
So this guy here--
let's see, I don't

00:27:05.079 --> 00:27:06.370
think there's an overhead here.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:06.960
No overhead?

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.660
Guess not.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.740
I'll just pass it around.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.240
So if you take it, put
your hands on the flat side

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.449
and load it like this, and
don't smoosh it like that.

00:27:14.449 --> 00:27:16.740
Just load it a little bit,
because you [? want to be ?]

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.400
linear elastic.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.550
If you load it
just a little bit,

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.258
you can see that as
you push it this way,

00:27:20.258 --> 00:27:22.150
it contracts in
sideways that way.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:22.904
So don't smash it.

00:27:22.904 --> 00:27:25.070
Just load it a little bit
and you can kind of see it

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.980
with your hands.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.780
And if you put on a
piece of lined paper,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.250
it's easier to see it.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.510
OK, so that's kind
of interesting.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.216
So are we good with getting
the Young's modulus in the one

00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:37.590
direction and the
Poisson's ratio

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.230
for loading in one direction?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.040
OK, so you can do the
same sort of thing

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.090
to get the Young's
modulus in the two

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.530
direction and the
Poisson's ratio

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.620
for loading in
the two direction.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.286
And you get slightly
different formulas,

00:27:47.286 --> 00:27:49.280
but it's the same idea.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.220
And you can also get a
shear modulus this way,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.604
and in-plane shear modulus.

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:55.020
It's a little bit-- the geometry
of it's a little bit more

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.950
complicated.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.590
So all of those things
are derived in the book,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.830
in the cellular solids book.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.500
So if you wanted to figure
those out, look at that,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.920
you could look at the book.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.149
So let me just comment on that.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:42.760
All right, so those are the
in-plane linear elastic moduli,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.320
and remember we said
that four of them

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.410
describe the in-plane properties
for an anisotropic honeycomb.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.830
And you can use that
reciprocal relationship

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.985
to relate the two Young's moduli
and the two Poisson's ratios.

00:28:57.985 --> 00:29:00.110
All right, so the next
thing I wanted to talk about

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.580
was the compressive strength.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.000
So let me just back
up here a second.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.860
So if we go back
to here, remember

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.780
we had for an
elastomeric honeycomb,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.480
this stress plateau was
related to elastic buckling.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.430
So we're going to look at
that buckling stress first.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.700
And this plateau here
is related to yielding.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.480
And then we'll look at
the yielding stress next.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.690
And then this plateau
here is related

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:27.600
to a brittle sort of crushing,
and we'll do that one third.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.400
So we're going to go
through each of those next.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.612
And this is kind of a schematic
for the elastic buckling.

00:29:33.612 --> 00:29:35.320
So when you look at
the elastic buckling,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.370
one of the things
to note is that when

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.850
you load the
honeycomb this way on,

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.350
if you load it in
the one direction,

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.330
you don't get buckling.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.115
It just sort of
continues to-- whoops,

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:44.742
if I can keep it in plane.

00:29:44.742 --> 00:29:46.450
It all just kind of
folds up, so you just

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.240
get larger and larger
bending deflections.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.510
You don't really get buckling.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.620
But when you load it this way
on, these vertical members

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.280
here, the ones of length
h, they're going to buckle.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.320
So, see if I do that,
my honeycomb looks

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.170
like those cells up on
the schematic there, OK?

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.594
So, whoops.

00:30:13.788 --> 00:30:16.571
So we're going to look at the
compressive stress or strength

00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:17.070
next.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.871
That's sometimes called
the plateau stress.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.180
So we can get cell collapse
by elastic buckling,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.800
if, for instance, the
honeycomb is made of a polymer.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.790
And then the stress-strain
curve looks something like that.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.550
And what happens
is you get buckling

00:30:54.550 --> 00:31:28.270
of those vertical struts
throughout the honeycomb

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:35.130
And then you could also
get a stress plateau

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.290
by plastic yielding.

00:31:41.094 --> 00:31:43.010
And what happens when
you get plastic yielding

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.100
is you get localization
of the deformation.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.390
So one band of cells will begin
to yield initially, and then

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.780
as the deformation proceeds,
that deformation ban will

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.690
propagate and get
bigger and bigger,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.310
and you get a wider
and wider band

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.430
of cells yielding and failing.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.300
So you get
localization of yield,

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.870
and then as
deformation progresses,

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:16.010
the deformation band widens
throughout the material.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.110
So if I go back and look--
if I look at this one

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:35.510
here, when you look at
this middle picture here,

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.430
you can see how one band of
cells has started to collapse

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.880
and started to fail.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.820
And as you continue to compress
that in the one direction,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.382
this way on, then more
and more neighboring cells

00:32:45.382 --> 00:32:47.090
are going to collapse
and the whole thing

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.136
will get wider until the
whole thing has collapsed.

00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:51.510
And that's kind
of characteristic

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.040
of the plastic failure.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.530
And then the third possibility
is brittle crushing.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.580
And then you get these
kind of serrated plateau.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.540
And the peaks and valleys
correspond to fractures

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.920
of individual cell walls.

00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:33.230
OK, so we're going
to start off with

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.120
the elastic buckling failure.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.160
And I'm going to call these
plateau stresses sigma star,

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.130
for the sort of
compressive strength.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.640
And el means it's
by elastic buckling.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.260
And as I mentioned, you don't
get it in the one direction.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.270
The cells just fold up.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.311
You only get it for loading
in the two direction,

00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:11.930
so it's going to
be sigma star el 2.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.680
Oops, need a different
piece of chalk.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.270
So you get this elastic
buckling for loading

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:42.700
in the x2 direction, and the
cell walls of length h buckle.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.950
And you don't get it for
loading in the one direction,

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:46.710
the cells just fold up.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:50.040
So again, let me draw a
little kind of unit cell here.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:07.370
And here is our stress
sigma 2, like that.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.650
And here's our little
wall of length h

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.050
that's going to buckle.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.480
So if I load it up, initially
it'll be linear elastic.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.120
And then eventually,
at some stress,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.970
it will get large enough that
this wall here will buckle.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.500
And we can relate
to that plateau

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.230
stress, or that
compressive stress,

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.750
to some Euler buckling load.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.390
So you remember, if we have
a pin-ended column, so just

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.030
a single column,
pins on either end,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.870
the Euler buckling
load says you get

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:42.820
buckling when the critical load
is equal to some end constraint

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.350
factor, n squared.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:50.330
So n squared pi squared E,
and here it's E of the solid,

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.410
I over the length of the
column, and in this case,

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.132
the column length
is h-- so h squared.

00:37:57.132 --> 00:38:00.310
OK, so that's just
the Euler formula.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.480
And here, n is an end
constraint factor.

00:38:10.164 --> 00:38:15.552
And if you remember
for a pin column,

00:38:15.552 --> 00:38:19.020
so if our column is pinned
at both ends like that,

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.150
and just buckles out like
that, then n is equal to 1.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:30.970
And if the column is
fixed at both ends,

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:35.530
something like that, then
the column looks like that

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.700
and then it's equal to 2, OK?

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.680
So if I know what the end
condition is, I know what n is

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.700
and I can use my
Euler formula here.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.575
So the trick to this is that
it's not so obvious what n is.

00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:51.504
Yes?

00:38:51.504 --> 00:38:54.468
AUDIENCE: So, when you're
loading in the x2 direction

00:38:54.468 --> 00:38:56.410
here, the first thing
you're going to get

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.089
is the incline
members deforming?

00:38:58.089 --> 00:38:58.880
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.440
AUDIENCE: And then
at some point,

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.682
you hit a P critical
that will cause

00:39:02.682 --> 00:39:04.250
the vertical members to buckle?

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.730
LORNA GIBSON: Exactly.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.995
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:04.995 --> 00:39:05.911
LORNA GIBSON: Exactly.

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:08.480
That's exactly right.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.492
Hello.

00:39:10.492 --> 00:39:12.200
So the trick here is
that we don't really

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.940
know what this n is, initially.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.420
They're not really
pinned, pinned;

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.720
they're not fixed, fixed.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.220
And if you think about the
setup with the honeycomb here,

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.800
the constraint on
that vertical member

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.610
depends on how stiff the
adjacent members are.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.284
So you can kind
of imagine, if I'm

00:39:27.284 --> 00:39:28.950
looking at one of
these vertical members

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.520
here, if these two adjacent
inclined members were

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.240
big honking thick things, it
would be more constrained.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.200
And if they were little thin,
kind of teeny little membranes,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.800
it would be less constrained.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.990
And you can think of it in
terms of a rotational stiffness,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:47.130
that when the honeycomb
buckles, you kind of

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.930
see the member h goes from
being horizontal to sort

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.190
of it buckles over like this.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.340
But that whole end
joint, see the end joint

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.880
at the top here or the end
joint at the bottom, that

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.850
whole joint rotates
a little bit.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.150
And so there's some rotational
stiffness of that joint.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.450
And that rotational stiffness
depends on how stiff

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:10.020
the member h is and how stiff
those inclined members are.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.790
So there's a thing called the
elastic line analysis that you

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.510
can use to calculate what n is.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.520
And basically what
that does is it matches

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.490
the rotational stiffness
of the column h

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.000
with the rotational stiffness
of those inclined members.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.240
So we're not going
to get into that.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.660
I'm just going to tell
you what the answer is.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.230
But if you want
to go through it,

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.950
it's in an appendix in the book.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.720
So you can look at
it, if you want.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:46.260
So here I'm just going to
say that the constraint

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:51.200
n depends on the stiffness of
the adjacent inclined members.

00:41:16.532 --> 00:41:18.200
And we can find that
by something called

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.600
the elastic line analysis.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.020
And if you have the book,
you can look in the appendix

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.360
and see how that works.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.930
But essentially
what it does is it

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:38.100
matches the rotational
stiffness of the column h

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.810
with the rotational stiffness
of the inclined members.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.860
So what you find is that n
depends on the ratio of h/l.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.710
And I'm just going to give
you a table with a few values.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:39.210
So for h/l equal to 1,
then n is equal to 0.686.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:44.890
For h equal to 1.5,
it's equal to 0.76.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:52.810
And for h/l equal to
2, it's equal to 0.806.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:57.460
OK, so now if we
have values for n,

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.689
we can just substitute in to
get the critical buckling load.

00:43:01.689 --> 00:43:03.230
And if I take that
load and divide it

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.260
by the area of
the unit cell, I'm

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.650
going to get my buckling stress.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.890
So it's pretty
straightforward from this.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.180
So my buckling stress is
going to be that critical load

00:43:54.180 --> 00:44:00.250
divided by my unit cell area.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.260
So it's divided by the unit
cell length in the x1 direction

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.477
to l cos theta times the
depth b into the page.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.860
So it's equal to n squared
pi squared Es times I.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.510
And I is bt cubed over 12.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.910
Divided by the length of
the column, h squared,

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.769
and then divided by the area of
the unit cell, 2l cos theta b,

00:44:39.769 --> 00:44:40.268
OK?

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.510
And I can rearrange
that somewhat

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.750
to put it in terms of
dimensionless groups.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.990
So if I pull all
the constants out,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.720
it's n squared pi squared
over 24 times the modulus

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:08.020
of the solid, t/l cubed
in the numerator divided

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:14.231
by h/l squared times cos
theta in the denominator.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:26.080
So again, you can see
that the buckling stress,

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.900
the compressive sort of
elastic collapse stress,

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.540
depends on the solid property.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.300
So here is the modulus
of the cell wall in here.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.860
Depends on the relative
density through t/l cubed.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:43.230
And then it depends on the cell
geometry through h/l cos theta,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.176
and n depends on
h/l as well, OK?

00:45:48.756 --> 00:45:50.130
And then we can
do the same thing

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.588
where we figure out what it is
for regular hexagonal cells.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.470
And it's 0.22 Es
times t/l cubed.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:18.530
And then we can also notice
that since E in the 2 direction,

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.421
for a regular hexagonal
cell, E is the same in the 2

00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:22.670
direction and the 1 direction.

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:24.140
It's isotropic.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:31.280
So E2 is also equal to 4 over
root 3 Es times t/l cubed.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:41.890
That's equal to-- whoops-- it's
equals to 2.31 Es t/l cubed.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:45.869
And we can say that the strain
at which that buckling happens

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:47.035
is just equal to a constant.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.110
And for regular
hexagonal honeycombs,

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:00.650
it works out to a strain of 10%.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.785
Are we good?

00:47:18.785 --> 00:47:19.910
So we have a buckling load.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.580
We divide by the area.

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.070
The only complicated
thing is finding n.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.500
And you can find it by this
elastic line analysis thing.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.620
So each of these
calculations is like

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.000
a little structural
analysis, only

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.875
on a little teeny weeny
scale of the cells.

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:38.000
So you see where my background
in civil engineering

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.320
comes in handy.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.270
Yup.

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.770
OK.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.980
So the honeycombs
involve the most sort

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.380
of complicated equations.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.110
When we come to do
the foams, we're

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.230
going to use a
dimensional analysis

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.430
and all the equations are
going to be much simpler.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.430
So this is the most
kind of tedious part

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:05.200
of the whole thing.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.100
So the next property
I want to look at

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.300
is the plastic collapse stress.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.430
Say we had a metal
honeycomb and we

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:18.470
wanted to calculate the stress
plateau for a metal honeycomb.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.930
So we have this
little schematic here,

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:24.500
and say we load it in
the one direction again.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.100
So we're loading it here.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.090
And we've got some
load P, like that.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.830
And if we have our honeycomb, we
load it this way on, initially,

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.567
the cell walls bend.

00:48:35.567 --> 00:48:37.150
And you have linear
elasticity and you

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.305
have some Young's modulus.

00:48:38.305 --> 00:48:41.402
But if you have a metal, if
you continue to deform it

00:48:41.402 --> 00:48:43.600
and you continue to
load it more and more,

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.101
eventually you're going to hit
the yield stress and the cell

00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:46.600
wall.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.240
So the stresses in
the cell wall are

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.770
going to hit the yield stress.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.089
And initially, the
stresses are just

00:48:52.089 --> 00:48:53.880
going to be-- remember,
if you have a beam,

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.701
the stresses are maximum at the
top and the bottom of the beam.

00:48:56.701 --> 00:48:58.450
So initially you're
going to hit the yield

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.707
stress at the top and the
bottom of the beam first.

00:49:00.707 --> 00:49:02.290
But as you continue
to load it, you're

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.730
going to end up yielding
the cross-section

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.470
through the entire section.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.770
So the entire section
is going to be yielded.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.970
And once the entire
section yields,

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:13.440
it forms what's called
a plastic hinge.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.830
Once the whole thing's yielded,
then you can add more force

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.280
and the thing just rotates.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.801
And because it rotates,
it's called a plastic hinge.

00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:22.300
You know, if you
take a coat hanger,

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.220
and you bend it back and forth
and bend it back and forth.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.320
If you bend it enough, you form
a plastic hinge because it just

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.640
can bend easily.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.250
So these little schematics
here, if you look at the,

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.900
say, one of these
inclined members,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.575
the moments are
maximum at the end.

00:49:39.575 --> 00:49:42.387
So Remember when we had the
linear elastic deformation

00:49:42.387 --> 00:49:44.470
and I looked at the little
bending moment diagram?

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.590
The moments are
maximum at the ends,

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.180
and you're going to form
those plastic hinges initially

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.330
at the ends.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:54.100
And so these little ellipsey
things here, all the ends,

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.510
those kind of show where
the plastic hinges are.

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:59.010
So those plastic
hinges are forming.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.250
So here's for loading
in the x1 direction,

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:05.440
and here's for loading in
the x2 direction, there.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.200
So the thing we
want to calculate

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.860
is what stress does it take
to form those plastic hinges

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.510
and get this kind of
plastic plateau stress?

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:44.930
OK, so we can say we get failure
by yielding in the cell walls.

00:50:56.967 --> 00:50:59.300
And I'm going to say the yield
strength of the cell wall

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.020
is sigma ys.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.830
So sigma y for yield
and s for the solid.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.170
And the plastic hinge forms
when the cross-section has fully

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:16.670
yielded.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.610
So let's look at the
stress distribution

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.940
through the cross-section
when its first linear elastic.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:05.100
So say that's the
thickness t of the member.

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.030
And if the beam
was linear elastic,

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:11.820
the stress would just [? vary ?]
linearly, like that, right?

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:15.190
And this would be the
neutral axis, here,

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:16.818
where there is no normal stress.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.320
So that's what happens
if it's linear elastic,

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.820
and I'm hoping you remember
something vaguely like that.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:27.412
Sounds good?

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.890
But as we increase
the load on it,

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.090
and we increase the
sort of external stress,

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:37.290
this stress in the member is
going to get bigger and bigger,

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.860
and eventually, that's going
to reach the yield stress, OK?

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.620
And once that reaches
the yield stress,

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.560
if we continue to
load it, what happens

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.220
is the yielding propagates
down through the thickness

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.170
of the thing here.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:51.270
So we get yielding through
the whole cross-section.

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:54.590
So let me scoot over here.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.570
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.320
LORNA GIBSON: Yup?

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.070
AUDIENCE: When it starts to
yield, does this curve change?

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:00.820
LORNA GIBSON: Yes.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.770
I'm going to draw it for you.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.670
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:05.040
LORNA GIBSON: That's
the next step.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.367
That would be the next thing.

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.190
OK, so once the stress
at the outer fiber

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:59.450
is the yield strength
of the solid,

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:03.524
then the yielding begins and it
progresses through the section

00:54:03.524 --> 00:54:04.440
as the load increases.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.180
So the stress distribution
starts to look something

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.589
like this once it yields.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.770
OK, so that's sigma
y of the solid.

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:50.150
Actually, let me rub
that out because then I

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:53.110
can show you something else.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:56.680
So in 3D, this would be through
the thickness of the beam.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.715
That would be the thickness
of the beam there.

00:55:01.685 --> 00:55:05.090
And boop, boop.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:06.960
It would look
something like that.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.210
OK?

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.305
And then this is still
our neutral axis here.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.640
And then eventually, as
you load it more and more,

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.626
the whole cross-section
is going to yield.

00:55:19.626 --> 00:55:20.126
Whoops.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.180
And I'm assuming that the
material is elastic, perfectly

00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:56.680
plastic.

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:15.660
So the stress-strain
curve from the solid I'm

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.098
idealizing as-- whoops.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.150
That's not quite right.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:25.610
I'm idealizing as that, OK?

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.050
So when you get to
this point here,

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:31.860
the entire cross-section
has yielded,

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.050
and that means you
form the plastic hinge.

00:56:56.507 --> 00:56:58.090
The idea here is
that the section then

00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:01.968
just rotates like a pin.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:10.110
All right.

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:31.430
So we can figure out
the plateau stress

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:33.980
that corresponds
to this by looking

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.630
at the moment that's associated
with the plastic hinge

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:38.220
formation.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:41.040
So there's some internal
moment associated with that.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.840
And then equating that
to the applied moment

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.770
from the applied stress.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:47.080
So doodle-loodle-oot.

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:52.690
Let me see me,
maybe back up here.

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.940
So there's some-- if I have
the stress distribution

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.160
here, I could say this
whole kind of stress block

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.330
is equivalent to
some force acting out

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:04.350
like that and some force
acting out like that.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:10.360
It would be sigma ys times
b comes t/2 would be f.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.250
And I can say there's
some plastic moment.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:17.240
If I think of the force
here and the force there,

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.865
they act as a couple and
they have some moment,

00:58:19.865 --> 00:58:22.490
and that's called
the plastic moment.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:24.020
So that's like an
internal moment

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.660
when the plastic hinge forms.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:38.079
So I'll say the internal
moment at the formation

00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:38.870
of a plastic hinge.

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.570
I'm going to call that
Mp, for plastic moment.

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.670
And we can work out Mp
by looking at that stress

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:59.600
distribution when the entire
cross section has yielded.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:06.990
The force F is going to be
sigma ys times b comes t/2.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.120
It's the stress times that area.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:15.440
And then the moment arm between
the two forces is also t/2.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.340
And so that plastic
moment is just sigma ys

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:24.360
bt squared over 4, OK?

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.740
Are we good?

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.648
Sonya?

00:59:27.648 --> 00:59:30.460
AUDIENCE: What's the
second [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:32.210
LORNA GIBSON: OK, so
this is the force.

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:35.760
This thing here is
the force F. And I

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.280
have to-- if I'm
getting a moment,

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:43.160
I'm saying that that force,
if I doot-doot-doot--

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:47.520
the distance between those
two forces there is t/2.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.769
So each force acts through
the middle of the block,

00:59:50.769 --> 00:59:52.602
and so the distance
between [? it is ?] t/2.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.810
And I'm going to equate that
moment to the applied moment

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.803
from the sort of applied stress.

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.405
And then if I go back to my
inclined member-- whoops,

01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:19.720
let's see.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.900
Let me get a little
more inclined.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.268
That's my inclined member,
there, of length l.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:33.800
I've got modes p
that are applied

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.880
at the end from sigma 1.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.170
And I've got moments that
are induced at the ends.

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:42.720
And that angle there
would be theta.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.940
This length here
is l, like that.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.680
And if I just use
static equilibrium

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.130
on that, I can say
that I've got 2 times

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:53.800
the moment, so I've got
one at each end-- they're

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.160
both the same sign--
minus P. And then

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.590
the distance between these
two P's, say I take moments

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.400
about here, I've got M
applied plus M applied,

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.686
I've got minus P
times l sine theta.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.474
That's equal to 0.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.728
So the applied moment there
is just Pl sine theta over 2.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.370
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:27.090
going to equate
this applied moment

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:29.190
with this plastic
moment, and I'm

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:32.780
going to relate P to my
applied stress sigma 1.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.840
And then I'm going to get a
strength in terms of the yield

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.980
strength of the solid, there's
going to be a t/l factor

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.400
and there's going to be
some geometrical factor.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.875
So that's just the last step.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:45.750
Boop-ba-doop-ba-doop.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.060
So we get plastic
collapse of the honeycomb.

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:38.902
And the stress I'm going to call
sigma star plastic with a 1,

01:02:38.902 --> 01:02:40.860
because I'm going to look
at the one direction.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:49.000
And that happens when that
internal plastic moment

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.363
equals the applied moment.

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.920
So let's see.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.230
I've got that.

01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:01.350
Let me also write
down over here,

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:05.900
I've also got this sigma
1 is equal to P over

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:13.670
h plus l sine theta times b.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:18.090
So here I can write P in terms
of sigma 1, in this thing.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:20.960
And then write that,
get the applied moment

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.326
in terms of that, and
then equate it to that.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:51.900
So this term on
the left-hand side

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.340
corresponds to this expression
for the applied moment

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.520
where I've plugged in.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.585
For P, I've plugged in
sigma 1 times h plus l sine

01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.610
theta times b.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:06.210
And that's my plastic moment
on the right-hand side.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.960
So if I just rearrange
this, I can then

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.110
solve for this plastic
collapse stress.

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:18.480
So it's equal to the yield
strength of the solid times

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.330
t/l squared, and then times
another geometrical factor.

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:28.850
2 times h/l plus sine
theta times sine theta.

01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:31.970
Doop-doop-doop.

01:04:41.584 --> 01:04:43.000
So the same kind
of thing, there's

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.890
a solid property, a t/l,
a relative density term,

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.350
in then a cell geometry term.

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:53.380
And we can calculate with this
for regular hexagonal cells.

01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:11.930
And we can do a similar
kind of calculation

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:13.560
for loading in the
other direction.

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:34.554
And you can get a shear strength
if you want to do that, too.

01:05:34.554 --> 01:05:36.595
AUDIENCE: If you're going
in the other direction,

01:05:36.595 --> 01:05:40.626
only the E or the M
apply changes, right?

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:41.750
[? Or ?] like that section.

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:43.010
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, this
thing here is the same.

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.380
AUDIENCE: That stays.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.213
LORNA GIBSON: Right.

01:05:44.213 --> 01:05:46.500
And this is-- there's a
different geometry to it.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.918
Because now you're
loading it this way on.

01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:15.630
OK, so we've calculated an
elastic buckling plateau

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:20.070
stress and a sort of plastic
collapse plateau stress.

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:23.140
And if you have thin enough
walled, say, even aluminum

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.440
honeycombs, then
the elastic buckling

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.110
could precede the
plastic collapse.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.790
And so I'm just going to work
out what the criterion would

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:32.872
be for that to happen.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:16.018
So the two stresses
can be equated.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.193
And then that's going to
give us some criterion.

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:35.550
So the two are equal, I'm
just going to write down

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.400
the equations that we had.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.455
So the buckling
stress was n squared

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:46.120
pi squared over 24 times
E of the solid times t/l

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:54.350
cubed divided by h/l
squared times cos of theta.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:08:00.260
And the plastic collapse
stress for the 2 direction

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:05.850
was sigma ys times t/l squared
divided by 2 cos squared theta.

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:14.140
So I can write this-- because
this has a t/l cubed term,

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.510
and that has a t/l
squared term, I

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.902
can write this in terms
of a t/l critical.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.090
So if I leave it t/l here
and I put everything else

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:34.300
on the other side, I've got
12 over n squared pi squared,

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:45.362
then h/l squared over cos
theta times sigma ys over Es.

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.399
So if t/l is less
than that, I'm going

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:51.659
to get elastic buckling first.

01:08:51.659 --> 01:08:52.920
And if it's more
than that, I'm going

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.260
to get plastic yielding first.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.710
And we can work
out an exact number

01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:04.220
for regular
hexagonal honeycombs,

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.220
so I'm going to do that.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.010
So if I have a
particular geometry,

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:16.740
I can figure out what n is.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.930
So for regular
hexagonal honeycombs,

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:25.260
t/l critical just
works out to 3 times

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.710
the yield strength of the
solid over the Young's modulus

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.315
of the solid.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.090
So if we know that
ratio of the yield

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:38.340
strength of the
modulus of the solid,

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:43.390
we can get some idea of what
that critical t/l would be.

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:46.529
So we'll do that next.

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:50.693
AUDIENCE: And you said if t/l
is less than that critical,

01:09:50.693 --> 01:09:52.527
then you're going to
get the yielding first.

01:09:52.527 --> 01:09:54.984
LORNA GIBSON: No, if it's less,
you get the buckling first.

01:09:54.984 --> 01:09:57.127
If it's really skinny,
it tends to buckle first.

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:31.480
So, for example, for metals, the
yield strength over the modulus

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.350
is roughly 0.002, like
the 0.2% yield strength.

01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:38.510
And so that means
that t/l, the sort

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:44.350
of transition or the
critical value is at 0.6%.

01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:46.924
So most metal honeycombs
are denser than that.

01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:48.090
That's a pretty low density.

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:19.010
But if we look at polymers,
you can get polymers

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:22.590
with a yield strength
relative to the modulus

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:30.860
of about 3% to 5%, and
then that critical t/l is

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.220
equal to about 10%, 15%.

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:38.390
So low-density polymers
with yield points

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:39.870
may buckle before they yield.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.540
So we have one more of these
compressive plateau stresses,

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.500
and that's for the
brittle honeycomb.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.500
So I don't think I'm going
to finish this today,

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.139
but let me set it up and then
we'll finish it next time.

01:13:23.254 --> 01:13:25.670
So the idea here is that if
you have a ceramic honeycomb--

01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:28.210
remember I showed you some
of those ceramic honeycombs--

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:31.400
that if you compress them, they
can fail by a brittle crushing

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.760
mode.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.990
So ceramic honeycombs can
fail in a brittle manner.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.950
And again, initially there
would be some cell wall bending,

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:00.570
but at some point, you're going
to reach the bending strength

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.470
of the material.

01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:04.950
And bending strengths are
called modulus of rupture.

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:07.940
So you reach the modulus of
rupture of the cell wall.

01:14:47.757 --> 01:14:49.590
So I'm not going to
write the equations down

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:51.506
today because we're not
going to get very far,

01:14:51.506 --> 01:14:52.782
so I'll do that next time.

01:14:52.782 --> 01:14:54.740
But we're going to set
this up exactly the same

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.260
as we did for the last one,
for the plastic yielding.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.540
But instead of getting
that sort of blocky,

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.007
fully yielded cross-section
stress distribution,

01:15:03.007 --> 01:15:05.090
we're just going to have
the linear elastic stress

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:07.150
distribution, and when
the maximum stress

01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:09.400
reaches that modulus
[? rupture, ?] the thing's

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.360
going to fail.

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.020
So the form of the
equations is going

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.060
to be very similar to what we
had for the plastic collapse

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.800
stress, but there's a slightly
different geometrical factor--

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.616
that's all.

01:15:18.616 --> 01:15:19.740
So we'll do that next time.

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.198
And then next time
we're also going

01:15:21.198 --> 01:15:23.450
to talk about the
tensile behavior

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:24.860
of honeycombs in-plane.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.516
We'll work out a
fracture toughness

01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:28.640
and then we'll start talking
about the out-of-plane

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.960
properties, as well.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.200
So on Wednesday, we'll do the
out-of-plane properties, OK?

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.530
So hopefully we'll finish
the out-of-plane properties

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:37.465
Wednesday.

01:15:37.465 --> 01:15:39.090
And then next week,
I was going to talk

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.130
about some natural
materials that

01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:44.690
have honeycomb-like structures,
so things like wood and cork,

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:45.860
OK?

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.640
All right, so this is the
kind of most equationy lecture

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.540
in the whole course.

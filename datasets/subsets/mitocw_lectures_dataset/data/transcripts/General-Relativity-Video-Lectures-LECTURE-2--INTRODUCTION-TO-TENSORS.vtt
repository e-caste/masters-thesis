SCOTT HUGHES: Good afternoon.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.460
So we spent our last
lecture laying out

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.240
some of the basic foundations,
making a couple of definitions.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.500
I want to quickly recap
the most important concepts

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.940
and definitions.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.947
And then, let me
be blunt, I kind of

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:27.780
want to get through
these definitions, which

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.800
I think it's important
to do them precisely,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.560
but there's nothing
significantly challenging

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.060
about them.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.170
We just need to make sure they
are defined very precisely.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.665
So now that you've kind of
seen the style of these things,

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.790
I would like to sort of
move through the next batch

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.010
of these definitions
quickly enough

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.420
that we can start to move into
more interesting material.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.780
So a quick recap--

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.910
and my apologies,
my daughter has

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.880
some kind of a virus that I am
desperately trying to make sure

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.980
I do not catch.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.247
And so I will be hydrating
during this lecture.

00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:05.830
So I just want to recap some of
the most important concepts we

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.340
went over.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.340
So this whole class
is essentially

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.160
a study in spacetime.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.440
Later, we're going to
connect spacetime to gravity.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.148
And general relativity
is going to become

00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:18.200
the relativistic
theory of gravity.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.380
So we began with a fairly
mathematical definition.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.120
Spacetime is a
manifold of events

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.860
that is endowed with a metric.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.320
Manifold, for our
purposes, is essentially

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.360
just a set in
which we understand

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.970
how different members of the
set are connected to each other.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.680
Events are really just when
and where something happens.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.690
We haven't precisely
defined metric yet.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.040
We will soon.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.530
But intuitively, just
regard it as some kind

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.560
of a mathematical object that
gives me a notion of distance

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.240
between these events.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.970
I tried and I will
continue to try

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.740
to be very careful
to make a distinction

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.810
between geometric
objects that live

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.047
in the manifold, the
events themselves

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:57.130
with things like a
displacement vector between two

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.560
events, other
vectors, which I will

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.870
recap the definition
of in just a moment.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.280
They have an existence and
sort of a reality to them

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.789
that is deeper and
more fundamental

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.730
than the representation
of that object.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.740
So when I say that the
displacement vector is delta t,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.090
delta x, delta y, delta z, that
is according to observer O.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.590
And when I write that down--

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.830
I will be very careful
as much as possible.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.288
I will occasionally
screw this up--

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:28.840
but I will try to
write this down

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.150
without using an equal sign.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.640
Equal sign implies
a degree of reality

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.110
that I do not want to impart
to that representation.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.980
So an equal dot with
a little o here,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.200
that's my personal
notation for delta

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.050
x is represented
by these components

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.620
according to observer O. And for
shorthand, I was sometimes just

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.570
write this by the collection
of indices delta x alpha.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.710
A different observer
O bar, they will

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.630
represent this this factor
using the exact same geometric

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.130
object.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.920
They all agree that it's
this displacement between two

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.660
physical events in spacetime.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.790
But they assign different
coordinates to it.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.800
They give a different
representation to it.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.972
And we find that representation
using a Lorenz transformation.

00:03:12.972 --> 00:03:14.680
And I'm not going to
write out explicitly

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.930
the Lorenz transformation
matrix lambda.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.190
I gave it in the last lecture.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.130
And I'm assuming you're all
experts in special relativity,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.410
and I don't need
to go over that.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.320
So I will then
using this as sort

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.130
of the prototype, the
general notion of a vector

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.630
in spacetime, which
we'll often call

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.380
a 4-vector for
the obvious reason

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.900
that it has 4
components, I'm going

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.557
to treat that as any quartet of
numbers that has transformation

00:03:38.557 --> 00:03:40.390
properties just like
the displacement factor

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.098
I just went over.

00:03:41.098 --> 00:03:43.270
So if there's some
quantity A that

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.720
has time like an x
or y and z component,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.445
as long as a different
observer, for reasons having

00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:51.820
to do with the
underlying physics

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.740
or whatever the
heck this A is, as

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.410
long as that different observer
relates their components

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.320
to observer O's components
via the Lorenz transformation,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.600
you got yourself a 4-vector.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.958
Any random set of four
numbers, that ain't a 4-vector.

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.000
You need to have some
physics associated with it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.667
And the physics has
to tell it that it's

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:10.830
a thing that's related by
a Lorenz transformation.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.110
So I want to pick
up this discussion

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.410
by introducing four
particularly important

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.890
and special vectors,
which to be honest,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.780
we're not going to use
too much beyond some

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.970
of the first couple of
weeks or so of the course,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.000
but they're very useful.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.458
And one should often bear in
mind, even later in the course

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.100
when they've sort
of disappeared,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.840
that they're coming along
for the ride secretly.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.570
And these are basis vectors.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.967
So if I go into frame O--

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:52.300
I'm just going to pick some
particular reference frame--

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.740
I can immediately write
down four special vectors.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.400
So remember, this is a Cartesian
type of coordinate system.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.390
So I'm going to introduce e0.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.670
I'm going to represent
this by just the number 1

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.220
in the time slot and
0 everywhere else.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:28.130
e1, or ex if you
prefer, I'm going

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.270
to write that down like so.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.490
And you can kind of see
where I'm going with this.

00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:50.890
The analogy, if you've all seen
unit vectors in other classes,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.660
hopefully this is fairly
obvious what I'm doing.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.327
I'm just picking out
a set of, you know,

00:05:54.327 --> 00:05:57.753
little dimensionless simple
quantities that point along

00:05:57.753 --> 00:05:59.170
the preferred
directions that I've

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.390
set up in this inertial
reference frame.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.070
A compact way of writing this--

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.730
so notice, I have
four of these vectors.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.000
And these vectors each
have four components.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.790
And so what I can say is that
the beta component of unit

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.940
vector e alpha is
representative,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.080
according to observer O, by
delta alpha beta, the Kronecker

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.580
delta.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.402
If you're not familiar
with this one,

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.360
I'm usually reluctant to
send you to Wikipedia.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.985
But in this case,
I'm going to send you

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:50.790
to Wikipedia, Wiki
via Kronecker delta.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.340
Yeah, so what that does
is it just emphasizes that

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.990
at least in-- by
the way, I should

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.020
put little o's underneath all
of these things, because I

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.848
have chosen this according to
observer o's representation.

00:07:01.848 --> 00:07:04.140
So this is just saying that
a coin to observer O, these

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.810
are four very special vectors.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.610
The utility of these things--

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.070
up high for everyone in
back to be able to see--

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:28.180
the utility of doing
this is that if I now

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.720
want to write the vector
A as a geometric object,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.190
I can combine the components
that observer O uses

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.637
with the basis vectors
that observer O uses.

00:07:38.637 --> 00:07:39.970
And I can sum them all together.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.290
I can put them together.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.020
And then I've got the--

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.380
it's not a representation.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.470
That's a damn vector.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:45.970
OK?

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.750
I put it all together using sort
of an internally consistent set

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.360
of numbers and basis vectors.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:01.900
And so I am free to say
this, where I actually

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.820
use an actual equal sign.

00:08:17.282 --> 00:08:18.990
You might stop and
think, well, but those

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.990
aren't the components of the
observer O bar would use.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.010
And you're right.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.530
Observer O bar would not
use those components.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.850
They would also not use
those basis factors.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.940
We're going to talk about
how those things change.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.080
But observer O bar does agree
that if they were handed

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.960
O's components and
O's basis vectors,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.179
this would give me a complete
representation of what

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.130
the vector is.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.422
OK?

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:44.130
So again, I'm really
harping on this sort

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.200
of distinction between
the geometric object

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.560
and the representation.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.075
This is the geometric object.

00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:51.792
And we can take
advantage of this.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.490
The fact that that
combination of things

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.550
is the geometric object is a
tool that I'm going to now--

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.340
is a fact that I'm going
to exploit in order

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.460
to figure out how my
basis vectors transform

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.780
when I change reference frames.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:29.310
So let me just repeat
what I wrote of there.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:42.610
But-- oops-- good point for
just a slight editorial comment.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.130
When you're talking
and writing and there

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.560
are millions of little
sub scripts and indices,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.810
sometimes the brain
and the appendages

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.790
get out of sync
with one another.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.560
I caught that one.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.550
I don't always.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.060
OK?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.720
So if you see
something like that

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.110
and you kind of go, um, why
did that alpha magically turn

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.790
into a beta, it's
probably a mistake.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.620
Please call it out.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.890
OK?

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.050
All right, so this is how I
build this geometric object,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.880
using the components
and the basis

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.582
vectors as measured by
O, as used by observer O.

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:15.040
Let's now write
out what they would

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.000
be if they were measured by a
different observer, an O bar

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.500
observer.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.500
I know how to get components,
the barred components

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.030
from the unbarred components.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.900
I don't yet know how
to get the barred basis

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.040
vectors from the
unbarred basis vectors.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.400
But I know that they exist.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.290
And that once I know what they
are, this equation is true.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.000
OK?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.680
These are just
two different ways

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.330
of writing this
geometric object, which

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.750
every observer agrees
has its existence that

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.420
transcends the representation.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.100
So let's rewrite what I've
got on the right-hand side

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.380
of the rightmost
equal sign here.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:08.350
I'm going to write this as
lambda mu bar beta A beta

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.230
e mu bar.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.657
And then now I'm going
to use a trick, which

00:11:16.657 --> 00:11:18.490
is what the-- it's not
even so much a trick,

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.120
but I'm just going to use a
fact that is great when you're

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.240
working in index notation.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.090
So often when students
first encounter

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.400
this kind of notation,
your instinct

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.170
is to try to write
everything out using

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.110
matrices and things like row
vectors and column vectors.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.420
It's a natural thing to do.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.285
I urge you to get over that.

00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:40.660
If I get some
bandwidth for that,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.160
I'm going to write
up a set of notes

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.640
this weekend showing how
one can translate at least 2

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.230
by 2 objects--

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.290
two index objects
and one index objects

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.960
in a consistent way
between matrices and row

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.300
vectors and column vectors.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.760
But we're rapidly going to
start getting into objects that

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.093
are bigger than that, for
which trying to represent them

00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:02.470
in matrix-like form
gets untenable.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.045
In a little while we're going
to have a three index object.

00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:07.090
And since we don't have
three-dimensional chalkboards,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.132
making this sort of matrix
representation of that

00:12:09.132 --> 00:12:10.862
is challenging.

00:12:10.862 --> 00:12:12.820
Soon after that, we'll
have four index objects.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.778
And we'll occasionally
need to take derivatives

00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:17.260
of that four index object,
giving us a five index object.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
At that point, the ability
to sort of treat them

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.700
like matrices is hopeless.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.710
So really, you should
just be thinking

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.368
of this as ordinary
multiplication

00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:28.660
of the numbers that are
represented by these components

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.760
as written out here.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.650
And an ordinary
multiplication like this,

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.960
I can just go ahead and swap
the order of multiplication

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.780
very easily here.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:47.550
So what I'm going
to do is move the--

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.400
hang on a second.

00:12:51.568 --> 00:12:53.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
I see what I'm doing.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.068
Sorry about that.

00:12:54.068 --> 00:12:58.200
I misread my notes.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.090
I'm just going to move
the A onto the other side

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.780
of my lambda.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.540
And then I'm going
to use the fact

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.380
that beta on my right-hand
side is a dummy index.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.060
So in that final expression
I wrote down over there,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.350
beta is a dummy index.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.600
And I'm free to adjust it
to put it into a form that's

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.558
more convenient for me.

00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:03.410
So let's begin.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.890
Let me just write where I've
got this equation right now

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.875
over there.

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:12.220
So A alpha E alpha equals--

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:18.740
and what I've got then is
component A beta lambda mu bar

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.240
beta--

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.200
keep mu bar.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.070
Sorry about that.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.490
So I'm going to
remap my dummy index.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.690
The reason I did that is I can
now move this to the other side

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.195
and factor out the A alpha.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.730
OK, everyone can
see that I hope.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.530
So see what I did
was I arranged this

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.780
so that I've
isolated essentially

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.950
only the transformation
of the basis vector.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.910
So this equation has
to hold no matter

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.420
what vector I am working with.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.260
It's got to hold for
an arbitrary A alpha.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.900
So the only way that
can happen, this

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:58.380
means that my transformation
of basis vectors

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.607
obeys a law that
looks like this.

00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:03.190
Now, on first
inspection, you're going

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.680
to go, ah, that's
exactly what we

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.010
got for the components
of the 4-vector.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.120
Caution-- I'm going
to remind you,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.900
it's actually on the
board over there.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.570
OK?

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.700
The barred component is
playing a different role

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.680
than the barred
basis vector here.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.330
If you want to get
the barred basis

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.640
vector from the
unbarred basis vector,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.740
you need to work with the
inverse of this matrix.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.240
That's what this
is telling us here.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.180
OK?

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.780
All that being said, if you're
just working through this

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.347
and you've got your
components set up

00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:54.930
and you're sort of
hacking through it,

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.765
the algorithm for you to
follow is actually simple.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.775
Really, all we're doing
is lining up the indices.

00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:12.650
We're summing over the
ones that are repeated

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.030
and requiring that
those that are

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.400
on both the left-hand side
and the right-hand side

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.950
appear and equal one another.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.770
Or as an old professor
of mine liked

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.990
to say about 12 times a
lecture, line up the indices.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.340
So that's essentially
what we're doing.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.670
In this case, I line up--

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.503
if I have my Lorenz
transformation

00:17:36.503 --> 00:17:38.670
matrix with the barred index
up top and the unbarred

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.663
down below.

00:17:39.663 --> 00:17:40.830
Boom, I line up the indices.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.080
And that tells me what the
unbarred basis components

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:50.400
are from the barred ones, and
vice versa for the components.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.560
So what basically, as I
just said, that tells me

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.250
if I actually want to get
this guy given this guy,

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.590
I need to work with the inverse.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.840
Put this up high so that
everyone in the back

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.340
can see it.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:16.140
So this, again, is one
of those places where

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.850
you might be tempted to
sort of write out a matrix

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.490
and do a matrix inversion.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.870
But before you do that,
remember this is physics.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.080
OK?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.040
The inverse is going to be-- the
inverse matrix is going to be

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.110
the one that does, at least
for certain quantities--

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.110
what the Lorenz
transformation does

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.260
is that it relates
objects, if I'm at rest,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.930
if I consider myself at rest,
it tells me about things

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.898
according to a frame that it's
moving with respect to me.

00:18:45.898 --> 00:18:47.440
The inverse matrix
does the opposite.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.930
It would say to
that person being

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.540
at rest, what is the
matrix that tells them

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.820
about things according
to me, and they

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.050
see me moving with the
exact same velocity,

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.360
but in the opposite direction.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.990
So to get the inverse matrix,
to get the inverse Lorenz

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:12.250
transformation,
what we end up doing

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.978
is we just reverse the velocity.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.120
So I've just wrote
down for you--

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.540
and it's worth bearing in mind,
every one of these lambdas

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.910
that is there, they
are really functions.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:44.510
And so my e alpha that
I wrote down over there,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.668
I'm going to use an under
tilde to denote a 3 vector.

00:19:48.668 --> 00:19:50.960
In one of your textbooks,
it's written with a boldface.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.235
But that's hard to
do on a blackboard.

00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:54.860
So if I want to go
the other direction,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.983
well, I just need to have
the inverse transformation.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.070
And I have that.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.670
Bear in mind, I mean, those are
really the exact same matrices.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.315
OK?

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.730
In terms of the function
that I'm working with here,

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.320
I'm just flipping around
the direction in order

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.300
to get these things out.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:21.800
OK?

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:37.770
So, as I said, you
might be tempted just

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:42.773
to go ahead and do
the matrix inversion.

00:20:42.773 --> 00:20:44.190
Let we just do a
quick calculation

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.333
to show you that
that would work.

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:48.750
And the reason I'm
doing this is I

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.917
just want to quickly step
through a particular step,

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:54.090
which is, again, sort of in the
spirit of swatting mosquitoes

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.280
with sledgehammers, it's
the kind of analysis

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.572
that you're going to sort of
have to do off to the side

00:20:58.572 --> 00:21:00.060
now and again.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:05.340
So given that I
know e alpha is--

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.060
let's see, let's use beta--

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:14.390
e beta bar be e beta bar.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:24.020
But I now know that I could
write this guy as lambda--

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.980
let's use a gamma--

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:33.425
beta bar minus v in
the gamma direction.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.300
Now, you look at that,
and you go, ooh, look,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.730
I'm actually summing
over the betas there.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.048
Let's gather my terms a
little bit differently.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:01.830
So notice, I have unbarred basis
vectors over here on the left,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.140
unbarred ones over
here on the right,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.900
a bunch of junk in these
braces here in the middle.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.020
The only way for that to work
is if after summing over beta,

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.030
that bunch of junk is, in
matrix language, we'd say,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.520
it's the identity matrix.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.278
In component
notation, we're going

00:22:17.278 --> 00:22:18.570
to call it the Kronecker delta.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.170
Just as little
aside, if I started

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.260
with the barred on the
left side and the unbarred

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.020
in the right-hand side and
did a similar analysis,

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:03.860
it would take you at this point
now that you are all fully

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.120
expert in this kind
of index manipulation,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.850
it should take you no
more than about a minute

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:24.250
to demonstrate to yourself
that you can get a Kronecker

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.460
delta on the barred
indices in a similar way,

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.540
just by using them in a
slightly different order.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.850
OK?

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.290
All right, so far all still
basically just formulas.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.980
So I'm going to start now doing
a little bit of formalism that

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.918
will very quickly
segue into physics.

00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:43.460
We can all take a
deep sigh of relief

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.560
and go, ah, OK, something
you can imagine measuring.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.185
So that's nice.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.360
So I have introduced 4-vectors.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.860
I haven't introduced the basis
vectors and their components.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.800
I haven't really done
anything with them yet.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.810
So before we start
doing things with them,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.190
let's think about
some operations

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.560
that we can do with 4-vectors.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.830
So the first one which
I'd like to introduce

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:08.685
is a scalar product.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.710
To motivate the scalar
product that I'm

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:21.800
going to define in the same
way that I defined 4-vectors

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.490
as a quartet of numbers whose
transformation properties

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.210
are based on the transformation
properties of the displacement,

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.730
I'm going to motivate
a general scalar

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:37.280
product between 4-vectors by a
similar kind of quantity that

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.570
is constructed from
the displacement.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.660
So let me recall a
result that I hope

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.074
is familiar from
special relativity.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:25:01.750
So working in units where
the speed of light is 1,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.610
you are hopefully all
familiar with the fact

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.150
that this quantity
is something that is

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.260
in variance to all observers.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.200
I did not use a
represented by symbol

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.570
there, because no matter
whose delta t, delta

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.820
x, delta y, delta
z I use there, they

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:21.190
will all agree on the delta s
squared that comes out of this.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.578
If I want to--

00:25:22.578 --> 00:25:24.370
actually, let me write
of a few things done

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.630
before I say anything more.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.430
So this is an invariant.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.805
This is the same--

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:42.550
let me actually write this in a
slightly different way-- it is

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.550
the same in all Lorenz frames.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.090
So pick some observer, get their
delta t, delta x, et cetera,

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.760
assemble delta s squared,
pick a different observer,

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.090
do the Lorenz transformation,
assemble their delta t prime,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.350
delta x prime, et cetera, make
that, boom, they all agree.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.290
So we're going to
use this to say,

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.340
you know what, I'm going to
call that the inner product

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.080
of the displacement
vector with itself.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:37.510
So I'm going to call this
delta x dotted into delta x.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:42.185
And so what this means is that
built into my scalar product--

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.140
so if I write this as
a particular observer

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.265
would compute it--

00:27:01.792 --> 00:27:03.250
this is the scalar
product that I'm

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.455
going to define with respect
to the displacement vector.

00:27:06.455 --> 00:27:08.830
And this is usually the point
where somebody in the class

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.290
is thinking, why is
there a minus sign

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.790
in front of the timelike piece?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.810
I can't answer that.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.320
All I can say is
that appears to be--

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
more than appears to be.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.090
There's a whole frickin' butt
load of evidence-- that's

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.817
not how nature is assembled.

00:27:27.817 --> 00:27:29.650
OK, it's connected to
the fact-- so the fact

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.630
that all of my
spatial directions

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.550
are sort of entered
with the same sign,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.780
but my timelike direction,
it has a different sign.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.060
It's connected to the fact
that I can easily move

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.863
left and right, front and back.

00:27:41.863 --> 00:27:43.030
It's a little bit of effort.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.980
I can move up and down.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.760
But I cannot say, oh, crap, I
left my phone at home I'll go

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.470
back 15 minutes and pick it up.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.170
You cannot move back
and forth in time.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.480
Time actually, which is
the timelike component

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.515
of this thing, it
enters into the geometry

00:27:57.515 --> 00:27:59.890
in a fundamentally different
way from the spatial things.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.830
And that's reflected
in that minus sign.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.580
Anything deeper than
that, let's just

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.700
say that we're probably
not likely to get very

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.560
far with that conversation.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.390
Depending on what kind
of muscle relaxants

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.940
you enjoy using on
the weekend, you

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.810
might have some fun
conversations about it.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.525
But it is not something
that you're really

00:28:19.525 --> 00:28:20.650
going to get very far with.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.640
You just kind of have
to accept that it's

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.470
part of the built-in
geometry of nature.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.110
OK, so this I am defining
as the inner products

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.990
of the displacement
vector with itself.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.350
I define vectors as having the
same transformation properties

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.550
as the displacement vector.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.490
We can similarly define an
inner product of a 4-vector

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.020
with itself.

00:29:10.275 --> 00:29:12.400
OK, now, I'll put
this on another board.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:38.040
So A dot A, I'm going
to define this--

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.530
or rather I will say it
is represented according

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:53.760
to observer O as minus A0
squared plus A1 squared plus A2

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.470
squared plus A3 squared.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.470
I realize there can be a
little bit of ambiguity

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.200
in the way I'm writing it here.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.250
You just have to--

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.450
if you're ever confused,
just ask for clarification

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.520
about whether I'm writing
something to a power

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.070
or whether it's an index label.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.050
Context usually makes it clear.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:17.730
Handwriting sometimes
obscures context though.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.880
The reason why I'm doing this
and a real benefit of this

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.130
is that whatever
this quantity is,

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.100
because A has the
same transformation

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.650
properties of the
displacement, this must

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.450
be a Lorenz invariant as well.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.040
The underlying mathematics
of Lorenz transformation

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.980
doesn't care that I wrote a
zero instead of delta x here.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.980
It doesn't care that I wrote A1
instead of delta x1, et cetera.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.480
It just knows that
it's a thing that

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.940
goes into that slot of
the Lorenz transformation.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.220
So all observers-- this
is how I represent it

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.325
according to observer O. But all
observers agree on that form.

00:31:01.325 --> 00:31:03.450
And as a consequence, this
is going to be something

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.670
that we exploit a lot.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.830
Even when we move beyond
the simple geometry

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.230
of special relativity,
a generalization of this

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:15.280
will be extremely important
for, not an exaggeration to say,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.530
everything.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.247
So a little bit of terminology--

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:31.210
so if A dot A is negative, and
depending upon which is bigger,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.550
A0 squared or the sum
of the other ones--

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.500
it could very well be negative--

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.590
we say that A is a
time like vector.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.130
This traces back to
the fact that if A

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.850
were the displacement
vector, if the displacement,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.610
the invariant interval, were
negative that would tell me

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.943
that the two events, which
are the beginning and the end

00:31:54.943 --> 00:31:57.290
of the interval, I could
find a frame at which they're

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.033
at the exact same location and
are only separated in time.

00:32:01.033 --> 00:32:02.450
In the same way,
this is basically

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.980
saying that I can
find a frame when

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.180
this vector points parallel
to some observer's time axis.

00:32:13.916 --> 00:32:19.070
If this is positive,
A is spacelike.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.430
Everything I just said about
timelike, lather, rinse,

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.903
repeat, but replace
time with space.

00:32:27.903 --> 00:32:28.403
OK?

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:37.780
And if A dot A equals
0, we say A is--

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.160
there's two words that
are commonly used--

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.580
lightlike or null.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.200
Null just traces back
obviously to the zero.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.280
Lightlike is because this is a
vector that could lie tangent

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.136
to the trajectory that a light
beam follows in spacetime.

00:32:58.136 --> 00:32:58.636
OK?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.520
OK, let me get some clean chalk.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.240
So, so far, I've only talked
about this inner product,

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.680
this scalar product.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.340
Oh, and, by the way, I'll
use inner product and scalar

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.035
products somewhat
interchangeably.

00:33:40.035 --> 00:33:41.660
But this allows me
to reiterate a point

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.070
I made in Tuesday's lecture.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.270
When I say scalar, scalar
refers to a quantity which is--

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.770
you know, it doesn't have any
components associated with it.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.312
So in that sense, it's familiar
from your eager intuition of,

00:33:52.312 --> 00:33:53.758
you know, not to vector.

00:33:53.758 --> 00:33:55.550
But it has a deeper
meaning in this course,

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.540
because I also want
it to be something

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.910
that is invariant
between reference frames.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.100
So A dot A is the
scalar product.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.280
It gives me a quantity that
all observers agree on.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.860
Now, I've only done
scalar products

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.020
of vectors, A and the
displacement vector,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.460
with themselves.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:22.949
So a more general notion,
if I have vectors A and B,

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.409
then I will define the
inner product between them,

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:30.510
as observed by O, as constructed
by observer O, rather, like so.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.732
It's not hard to
convince yourself,

00:34:44.732 --> 00:34:46.190
given everything
we've done so far,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.605
that this quantity
must also be invariant.

00:34:49.605 --> 00:34:50.980
I'll sketch a
really quick proof.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.060
Let's define-- let's say
we have two 4-vectors, A

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:06.760
and B. Their sum, by
the linearity rules that

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.530
apply to these vectors,
must also be a vector.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:17.620
And so if I compute, C dot
C, this is an invariant.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:27.340
With a little bit of
labor, that basically

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.100
boils down to middle
school algebra.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.570
You can show that C dot
C is A dot A plus B dot B

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.270
plus twice A dot B.
This is invariant.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.070
This is invariant.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.000
This is invariant.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.760
And so this must be invariant.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.068
So this is really useful for
us, because we now have a way--

00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:55.360
I've introduced these objects,
these geometric objects,

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.480
these 4-vectors.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.760
We are going to use
them in this class

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.920
to describe quantities
that are of interest

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.040
to the physicist who wants to
make measurements in spacetime.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.498
We've now learned
one of the things

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.040
when you're doing
stuff in relativity

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.270
is you have to be careful
who is measuring what.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.630
What are the components
that 4-vector as seen

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.038
by this observer?

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:16.580
What about their friend who's
jogging through the room at 3/4

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.340
quarters speed of light?

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.243
What about their friend who's
driving 2/3 the speed of light

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.010
in the other direction?

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.343
You have all these really
annoying calculations that you

00:36:22.343 --> 00:36:24.660
can and sometimes have to do.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.820
This gives us a way to
get certain things that

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.350
are invariant out
of the situation

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.830
that everyone is
going to agree on.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.250
Invariants are our friends.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.860
So earlier today, earlier
in today's lecture,

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.480
I talked about how I can write
my 4-vectors using the basis

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.500
factors.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.410
So another way of writing this--

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.390
so what's sort of annoying
is every time I've actually

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.970
written out the inner product,
I have used the represented

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.890
by symbol.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.640
I don't want that.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.900
I want to have equal
symbols in there, dammit.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:09.390
So let's take advantage
of the fact that A dot B,

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.240
I know how to expand A and
B using components and basis

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.740
vectors.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.790
And again, using
the index notation,

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.670
I can just pull everything
out and rearrange

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.420
this a little bit.

00:37:43.588 --> 00:37:45.380
Whenever you get down
to a point like this,

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.500
we now get to do what every
mathematician loves to do--

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.360
give something a name.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.750
I'm going to define the
inner product of basis vector

00:37:53.750 --> 00:38:01.800
A with basis vector B to
be a two index tensor--

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.840
eta alpha beta.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:12.430
What's lovely about this, this
is a totally frame invariant

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.940
quantity.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.060
We know that.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.060
And so I've now found a way to
write this using the components

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.350
as something that gives me
a result that is totally

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.435
frame invariant.

00:38:21.435 --> 00:38:23.060
Now, when you hack
through a little bit

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.820
the algebra of this,
what you'll find

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.220
is that the components
of this metric--

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.610
oh, shoot, I didn't want to
actually say it out loud--

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.802
the components of this
tensor, which pretend

00:38:31.802 --> 00:38:33.010
you didn't hear me say that--

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:37.208
the components of this tensor
has the following components--

00:38:37.208 --> 00:38:39.625
I just said something circular--
has the following values.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.130
This is, as I
unfortunately gave away

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.010
the plot, this is,
in fact, the metric

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.250
that I said at the beginning
is the quantity that I must

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.810
associate with
spacetime in order

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.210
for there to be a notion
of distance between events.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.137
I haven't really said what
a tensor is carefully yet.

00:39:15.137 --> 00:39:17.220
I'm going to make a more
formal definition of this

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.040
in just a moment.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.623
But this is your
first example of one.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.020
And so the way in
which this actually

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.170
gives me a notion of
distance is through this

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.360
that I wrote down right here.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.840
If I have two
events in spacetime

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:49.410
that are separated by
a displacement delta x,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:55.770
the delta s squared, which
I obtained from this thing,

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.160
is fundamentally the notion
of distance between those two

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.420
events that I use.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.450
And notice, it's a little
less normal of a distance

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.950
than you're used
to when you do sort

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:06.400
of ordinary Euclidean geometry.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.786
This is a distance whose
square can be negative.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.370
What we like to say
is that when you're

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:26.960
working in special
relativity, it's

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.480
not necessarily positive-- the
distance between two events

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.480
is not necessarily-- the
distance squared is not

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.162
necessarily positive definite.

00:40:34.162 --> 00:40:35.870
If it's negative,
though, that just means

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.390
it's sort of dominated by the
time interval between them.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:40.640
If it's positive, you know
it's dominated by the space

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.900
interval between them.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.375
If it's zero, well,
you actually know--

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.500
it's actually a little bit
confusing at that point.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.490
They could be, in
fact, you know,

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.380
very widely separated
in both space and time,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.080
but in such a way that a
light beam could connect them.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.940
So there's a lot of
information encoded in that.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.832
Now, as we move forward--

00:41:00.832 --> 00:41:02.540
hang on a second--

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:08.020
as we move forward, we're
going to upgrade this.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.760
So right now, our metric
is just this simple matrix

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.160
of minus 1s, 0s, and 1s.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.180
One of things that
we're going to do

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.700
is sort of a warm-up exercise
to the more complicated things

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.750
we're going to do
later is we're going

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.737
to move away from
special relativity

00:41:26.737 --> 00:41:27.820
and Cartesian coordinates.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.160
We're going to look at
it in polar coordinates.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.118
That's going to be kind
of like a warm-up zone.

00:41:31.118 --> 00:41:33.790
And so when we do
that, we're always

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:38.740
going to reserve eta for the
metric of special relativity

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.920
when I'm working in
Cartesian coordinates.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.670
It's just a great
symbol to have for that.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.320
And it's a useful
thing to always

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.130
have that definition in mind.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.030
I can continue to do
special relativity,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.710
but then working in
coordinates that are, you know,

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.050
spherical-like or polar-like
or something like that,

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.960
then this is going
to become a function.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.000
And what that is
going to mean is

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.680
that things like my
little basis vector

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.580
is going to have more
complicated behavior.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.330
A little later in the
course, we will then

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.380
show that when gravity
enters into the picture,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.910
essentially the
essence of gravity

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.670
is going to be encoded in
this thing as well in a way

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:14.420
where, again, it's
going to be a function.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.810
It's going to vary as a
function of space and time.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.175
And the dynamics of gravity
will be buried in that.

00:42:19.175 --> 00:42:21.550
It's sort of funny that it
really does just sort of start

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.050
out--

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.940
I mean, if you take that thing
and you set delta t equals 0,

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.100
this is just the bloody
Pythagorean theorem.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.820
That is all this is.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.430
Put time back in, and it
sort of is the generalization

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.055
of Pythagoras to spacetime.

00:42:35.055 --> 00:42:37.180
And, in fact, we're going
to take advantage of that

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.610
and sort of define
a geometry that

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.698
looks like this as being
flat in the same way

00:42:41.698 --> 00:42:43.990
that a board is flat, and
the Pythagorean theorem works

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:45.258
perfectly on it.

00:42:45.258 --> 00:42:47.050
Then, we're going to
start think about what

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.370
happens when it becomes curved.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:49.420
And you start
thinking about things

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.920
like, what is the geometry on
the surface of the sphere look

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.432
like?

00:42:52.432 --> 00:42:53.890
That's just sort
of pointing ahead.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.557
So I just throw that
at you, so that you

00:42:55.557 --> 00:42:57.520
get ready for some
of the concepts

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.090
that we'll be
talking about soon.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.070
So let me write this actually
in terms of differentials.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.070
It's sort of useful for
what I want to say next.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.180
So a little differential, if
I have two events in spacetime

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:22.670
that are very close
to one another,

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.140
I can write them like so.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.630
And what I've
essentially done here

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:35.870
is written dx as
dx alpha e alpha.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:37.762
Before I get into some
more sort of a couple

00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:39.470
of important, fairly
important 4-vectors,

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.860
the reason I did this is I
want to make an important point

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.780
about some notation and
terminology that is used.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:54.570
If it is the case that the
displacement vector is related

00:43:54.570 --> 00:44:07.310
to the differentials of
your coordinates like so,

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:18.590
we say that e alpha is a
coordinate basis vector.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:31.350
What it does is it transforms a
differential of your coordinate

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:37.782
into a differential
vector in spacetime.

00:44:37.782 --> 00:44:39.990
Now, you, may be thinking
to yourself, OK, well, what

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.060
other kind can there be?

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.660
Well, this is where
my little spiel there

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.077
a second ago about
how we're going

00:44:53.077 --> 00:44:56.155
to start looking at
more complicated things,

00:44:56.155 --> 00:44:57.460
it's going to become important.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.790
So when we're working in a
Cartesian-like coordinate

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.150
system, the fact that this is
what we call a coordinate basis

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.743
vector isn't very interesting.

00:45:26.945 --> 00:45:29.070
Suppose I was working in
some kind of a curvilinear

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.360
coordinate system, OK?

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.010
Spherical coordinates.

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.290
Now, let's just focus
on 3-space for a second.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:52.320
So if I write a sort
of analogous equation

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.820
in curvilinear coordinates--

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.285
OK, so here's the
3-space version of that.

00:46:00.285 --> 00:46:04.020
Now let's imagine that i
equals 1 corresponds to radius,

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.660
i equals 2 is theta,
i equals 3 is phi.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:22.943
Then, this would be dr er plus d
theta e theta plus d phi e phi.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.560
Does that disturb you at all?

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.120
OK, this has
dimensions of length.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.690
These have the
dimensions of angle.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.340
In order for this to work,
er must be dimensionless.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.730
e theta must have the
dimensions of length.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.690
e phi must have the
dimensions of length.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.640
This is what a
coordinate basis looks

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.130
like when I am dealing with--

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.660
well, we're going to use
is a lot in this thing.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.070
I introduce this right now
because you are all probably

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.870
looking at that, and
some small part of you

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:08.140
inside is weeping, because
what you want me to write down

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:08.695
is this.

00:47:20.975 --> 00:47:23.200
Ah, isn't that better?

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.380
OK, this looks like
something you're used to.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.925
So I throw this
out here right now

00:47:32.925 --> 00:47:34.550
just because I want
to make sure you're

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:38.030
aware that there
are some equations

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.408
and some foundational stuff
you guys have been doing

00:47:40.408 --> 00:47:42.950
over the years, particularly,
this shows up a lot when you've

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:46.580
done E&M out of a textbook
like Purcell or Griffiths

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:52.850
or Jackson, because there's
some derivative operators, which

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:56.560
are assuming that your basis
vectors are what we call

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.667
orthonormal.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:11.365
So my e i hat here, it
is an orthonormal basis.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.690
And orthonormal
basis is defined such

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:32.170
that the dot product of any
two members of this thing

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.930
gives me back the
chronic or delta.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:38.620
That is not necessarily
the case when

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.375
I work with a coordinate basis.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:52.515
Our basis has er
dot er equals 1.

00:48:52.515 --> 00:48:54.100
Yay, that one's nice.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:49:02.180
But when I do e theta dot
e theta, I get r squared.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.888
e phi dot e phi will be r
squared sine squared theta.

00:49:15.888 --> 00:49:17.860
And what I'm going
to do when I start

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.920
generalizing these things,
I'm going to change my--

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.497
this thing which I
defined up here--

00:49:22.497 --> 00:49:23.830
do I still have it on the board?

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.788
Yeah, yeah, right here.

00:49:24.788 --> 00:49:29.350
So when I set eta alpha beta is
e alpha dot e beta and I made

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.660
it this thing, I'm going
to generalize this and say

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.150
at the dot product
of any two basis

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:37.090
vectors it gives me
a more general notion

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.680
of a metric tensor.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.660
And the values in
the metric tensor

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.620
maybe functions like this.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.370
Right now, throw that
out there, you know,

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.180
this might be sort of just
like a peak of the horrors

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:49.810
that lie ahead.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:52.227
OK, we're not going to worry
about this too much just yet.

00:49:52.227 --> 00:49:53.980
But I want you to be
prepared for this.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.570
In particular,
it's really useful

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.780
to have this notion
of a coordinate basis

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.810
versus an orthonormal
basis in your head.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.150
We're going to start defining
some derivative operations

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.740
soon.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.490
In fact, probably won't
get to them today,

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:11.227
but they will be present when
we start doing Lecture 3.

00:50:11.227 --> 00:50:13.060
And there's a couple
of results that come up

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.643
where everyone's
sort of like, wait, I

00:50:14.643 --> 00:50:17.300
knew that the divergence had a
factor of r on that derivative

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:17.800
there.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.760
Where'd it go?

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.850
It's because we're not working
in an orthonormal basis.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.222
All right, I'm a
little sick of math.

00:50:27.222 --> 00:50:28.430
So let's do a little physics.

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:38.800
So, so far, the actual
only physical 4-vector

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.950
that I've introduced is
the displacement vector.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:00.020
From the displacement
vector, it's really easy

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.180
to make the probably
the first and simplest

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:10.270
important 4-vector, which
is known as the 4-velocity.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.140
This tells me the rate of
displacement of an observer

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.032
as this person moves
through spacetime per unit--

00:51:22.032 --> 00:51:24.365
and we're going to be careful
about this in this class--

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:39.410
d tau is the time
interval as measured

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:53.400
along the trajectory of the
observer with 4-velocity u.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.370
In other words-- that's a very
long winded way of saying it--

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:58.440
it's an interval of proper time.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.323
In English, the word proper
time sounds very like, woo,

00:52:12.323 --> 00:52:13.740
I don't want to
use improper time.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.572
I better use that.

00:52:14.572 --> 00:52:16.530
But this actually I think
it comes from French.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:19.680
It just refers to the fact
that it's one's own time.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.780
Apparently in German
people say eigenzeit.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.420
So, you know, there's a couple
of different words for it.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.703
But proper time is what we use.

00:52:27.703 --> 00:52:29.370
In special relativity,
if we see someone

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:35.410
going by with constant velocity,
a particular observer who sees,

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:36.020
you know--

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:36.770
we're here in the room.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.687
Someone comes through.

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:39.170
Their 4-velocity is u.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.350
We would see their 4-velocity
to have the components

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:48.290
gamma gamma v, where
gamma, I'll remind you,

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:52.750
is the special
relativistic Lorenz factor.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:57.200
And I'll remind you again
we've set speed of light to 1.

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.220
A very useful thing,
which we're actually

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.760
going to take advantage
of quite a bit,

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.750
is that in the rest frame of u--

00:53:24.795 --> 00:53:25.920
pardon me for a second--

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:34.200
in the rest frame
of u, or I should

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:47.922
say of the observer
whose 4-velocity is u,

00:53:47.922 --> 00:53:51.340
they just have 1 in
atomic direction, C,

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.760
if you want to put your
factors back into their.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.260
And that's basically just saying
that the person is standing

00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.000
still, but moving through
time, because you are always

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.160
moving through time.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:10.600
All right, from the 4-velocity
for an observer who has--

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.870
or for an object, I should
say, who has some mass,

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:24.160
we can easily define
the 4-momentum,

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.540
where this m is known as the
rest mass of this object.

00:54:36.921 --> 00:54:40.820
It's worth a bit of
description here.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.430
You will often see, particularly
in some older textbooks that

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:44.860
discuss special
relativity, people

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:48.330
like to talk about
the relativistic mass.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.480
And that comes from the
fact that if I write out

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.640
what this thing
looks like according

00:54:52.640 --> 00:55:02.540
to some particular observer,
you have this gamma m entering

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.890
into both of the components.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:05.660
And so older
textbooks often called

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.390
gamma m the relativistic mass.

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:10.348
That's not really
the way people have--

00:55:10.348 --> 00:55:12.140
over the course of the
past couple decades,

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.900
they've moved away from that.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.930
And it's just more useful
to focus on the rest mass

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.703
as the only really
meaningful mass,

00:55:19.703 --> 00:55:21.120
because, as we'll
see in a moment,

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.180
it's a Lorenz invariant.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:27.207
We'll see how that is in
literally about 3 minutes.

00:55:27.207 --> 00:55:28.790
And so what we're
instead going to say

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:33.360
is that as seen by some
particular observer,

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.100
this has a timelike
component that

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.490
is the energy that that
observer would measure

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.470
and a set of
spacelike components

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.720
that are the momentum that
that observer will measure.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.470
So where we get a bit of
important physics out of all

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:53.128
this stuff is by coupling these
two 4-vectors to the scalar

00:55:53.128 --> 00:55:54.170
products that we made up.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:12.550
So the first one,
if you do u dot u,

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.110
according to any
observer, that's

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:18.340
just going to be
minus gamma squared

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.300
plus gamma squared v squared.

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:28.390
And with about 20 seconds
worth of analysis,

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:33.826
you can find that this is
always equal to minus 1.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.390
Actually, there's an even
trickier way to do this.

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.980
Suppose I evaluate this in
the rest frame of the observer

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.690
whose 4-velocity is u?

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:50.380
Well, in the rest frame,
v is 0, and gamma is 1,

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.800
and I get minus 1.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.080
And this is an invariant.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.120
So whatever I get in
that particular frame

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.285
must be obtained in all frames.

00:56:57.285 --> 00:56:58.660
That's a trick
we're going to use

00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.868
over and over and over again.

00:56:59.868 --> 00:57:01.645
Sometimes you can identify--

00:57:01.645 --> 00:57:03.820
you know, you get some kind
of God awful expression

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.960
that just makes
you want to vomit.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.460
But then you go,
wait a minute, what

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.667
would this look like in
frame blah, blah, blah?

00:57:08.667 --> 00:57:10.750
And you sort of think about
some particular frame.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.780
And in that frame,
it may simplify.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.890
And if it does and it's a frame
invariant quantity, mazel tov,

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:19.960
you have just basically
won the lottery.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.360
You've got this
all taken care of.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.610
Go on with your life.

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:29.120
So the 4-velocity has a
scalar product of itself

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.510
that is always minus 1.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:31.010
OK?

00:57:37.365 --> 00:57:40.810
How about the 4-momentum?

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:45.370
Well, the 4-momentum is
just 4-velocity times mass.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.240
So that's just minus m squared.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.870
But we also know it's related
to these two other quantities,

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.430
which are important in physics.

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:17.260
This is related to the
energy and to the momentum.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.760
So this is also equal to
minus e squared plus--

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:28.340
so this is the ordinary 3--

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.010
the magnitude of the 3-vector
part of this thing as

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:34.760
measured by the
observer who breaks up

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.040
the 4-momentum in this way.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.800
So what this means is I
can manipulate this guy

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:40.970
around a little bit here.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.060
Anybody who works
in particle physics

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.810
is presumably familiar
with this equation.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.435
Sometimes it appears
with the p squared

00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:00.160
moved onto the other side.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.650
If it looks a little
bit unfamiliar to you,

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.690
let me put some factors
of C back in this.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.810
So remember, we have
set C equal to 1.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.860
When you put it back
in, that's what this is.

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.320
So it drops out of this in
a very, very simple way.

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.840
One of the uses of this--

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.450
and many of you have
done exercises presumably

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:33.200
in some previous
study that does this.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.277
And there'll be one
exercise on the p set

00:59:38.277 --> 00:59:40.110
that was just posted
where you exploit this.

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.270
So a key bit of
physics, the reason

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:50.430
why we care about 4-momentum is
it's in one mathematical object

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:52.440
allows us to combine
conservation energy

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.730
and conservation of momentum.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:06.617
So conservation of 4-momentum
puts both conservation

01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:08.200
of energy and
conservation of momentum

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.340
into one mathematical object.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:20.900
So if I have n
particles that interact,

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:39.143
then the total 4-momentum is
conserved in the interaction.

01:00:45.765 --> 01:00:46.720
OK?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.637
So, yeah, we talk a
little bit more about this

01:00:50.637 --> 01:00:52.220
and then just sort
of quickly move on.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.370
So combining this
with the fact that we

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.702
are free to change our
reference frames often

01:00:59.702 --> 01:01:01.910
it gives us a trick that
allows us to really simplify

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:03.190
a lot of analysis.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.005
So if I have n
particles that are

01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:10.380
sort of swarming
around and doing

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:16.470
some horrible bit of
business that I need to study

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:22.020
and I need to have a
good understanding of,

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:37.780
we can often vastly
simplify our algebra

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.372
by choosing a special and very
convenient frame of reference

01:01:41.372 --> 01:01:42.580
in which to do our analysis--

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.270
choose the center
of momentum frame.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.255
So this is the time frame
in which that that p tote--

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.786
so C-O-M, center of momentum--

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:12.060
has zero spatial momentum.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.830
In that frame, you have just as
much momentum going to the left

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:16.872
as going to the right,
just as much going forward

01:02:16.872 --> 01:02:19.300
as going backwards, as much
going up as going down.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.930
And so this turns out to be--
so the classic example of where

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:29.592
this is really useful is when
you are studying particle

01:02:29.592 --> 01:02:32.050
collisions and you're looking
at things like the production

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:33.253
of new particles.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:50.660
So imagine you've got particle
A with some 4-momentum PA coming

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.130
in like this.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:56.030
Particle B's got some
4-momentum coming in like this.

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:58.310
These guys collide.

01:02:58.310 --> 01:02:59.270
And they do so--

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.950
I work in the center
of momentum frame.

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:04.490
I might want to just calculate
the energy at which they just

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:10.440
happen to produce some new
pair of particles at rest.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.880
I would like to
find the threshold

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.290
for this particular
creation process.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:14.790
OK?

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.457
So you're going to
play with one problem

01:03:16.457 --> 01:03:18.950
on the p-set that's
kind of like that.

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.630
Let's see, what do
I have time to do?

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.500
I think I will do--

01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:26.280
yeah, I think I can
do two more things.

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:43.710
So all the dot products that I
have been talking about so far

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.640
have been a dot product
of a 4-vector with itself.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.050
I did u dotted into u.

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.240
I did p dotted into p.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.240
I invented a frame in which p
has a particularly simple form.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.198
And then when you actually
do some of analysis,

01:03:56.198 --> 01:03:59.213
you would probably take that
p tote and dot it into itself.

01:03:59.213 --> 01:04:00.630
I haven't done
anything that looks

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:03.570
at the crossing between
these two things,

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:07.435
dotting one into the other.

01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:11.450
So let me to go through
a very useful result that

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:14.570
follows by combining p with u.

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:16.730
There's a very
specific notion of p

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:18.140
and a very specific notion of u.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.900
Let's let p be the
4-momentum of a particle.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.470
I call it a.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:13.190
Let's let u be the 4-velocity
not of a, but the 4-velocity

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:22.902
of observer O. So
particle a might

01:05:22.902 --> 01:05:24.860
be a muon that was created
the upper atmosphere

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.960
and is crashing through
our room right now.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.780
Observer O might be
your hyperactive friend

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.245
who is jogging through the room
at half the speed of light.

01:05:33.245 --> 01:05:39.530
The question I want to ask
is, what does O measure

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:45.705
as the energy of particle a.

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:14.060
So the naive way to do
this, which I will emphasize

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:18.320
is not wrong, what you
might do is sort of go,

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.210
OK, well, we're sitting here.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.140
This room is our laboratory.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.910
I've measure this
thing in my lab.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.480
So I know p as I measure it.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.280
I can see O jogging by.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.180
So I know O's 4-velocity
as I measure it.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.390
So what I should do is figure
out the Lorenz transformation

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:38.720
that takes me into
the rest frame of O.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.658
Once I have that
Lorenz transformation,

01:06:40.658 --> 01:06:42.200
I'll apply that
Lorenz transformation

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.510
to the 4-vector p.

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:47.030
Boom, that will
give me that energy.

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:47.960
That will work.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.070
That will absolutely work.

01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:54.110
But there's an
easier way to do it.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:11.010
So one thing you should note is
that everybody represents that

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:17.636
4-velocity as an energy--

01:07:17.636 --> 01:07:19.760
excuse me, they
represent the 4-momentum

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.573
as an energy and a 3-momentum.

01:07:21.573 --> 01:07:23.240
In particular, though,
they represent it

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.030
as the energy that
they would measure

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:30.440
and the 3-momentum that
they would measure.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:39.730
So that means p as seen
by O is e according to O

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:48.545
and p according to O. That are
acquainted o is what we want.

01:07:48.545 --> 01:07:49.920
And I just told
you a moment ago,

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.208
you know, if you have p in
your own reference frame,

01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:54.000
and you have u in your
own reference frame,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.250
you can do this whole math
with Lorenz transformations

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:57.000
and get it out.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.930
But you also know that in
O's own reference frame,

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:15.770
O represents their 4-velocity as
1 in the timelike direction, 0

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.135
in the spatial direction.

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:31.420
So what this means is if I
go into O's reference frame,

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:42.140
if I go into their
inertial reference frame,

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.710
notice that if I take the
dot product of p and u,

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:49.275
I get e times 1 and p times 0.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:02.439
So that is just negative.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:05.207
It's exactly what I
want-- modulo minus sign.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.540
And so you go, OK, well, I'll
flip my minus sign around.

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:15.069
And you think, OK,
great, but I did

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:17.170
that using those
quantities as written down

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:18.640
in O's reference frame.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.680
And then you go,
holy crap, that's

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.109
the invariant scalar product.

01:09:23.109 --> 01:09:23.810
I'm done.

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:24.310
Mic drop.

01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:26.080
Leave the room.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.000
What this means is you start
with p as you measure it,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.399
u as you measure it.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:35.680
Take the scalar product
between the two of them.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.840
Boom, the answer
you want pops out.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.910
No nonsense of Lorenz
transformations.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:42.194
None of that garbage
needs to happen.

01:09:42.194 --> 01:09:44.319
You just take that inner
product and you've got it.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.970
So that sort of says
in words, no matter

01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:32.565
what representation you choose
to write down p and u in,

01:10:32.565 --> 01:10:34.440
take the dot product
between the two of them,

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.500
throw in a minus sign, you've
got the energy of the particle

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.840
with p as measured by
the observer with u.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.810
It's sort of late in the
hour, or the hour and a half

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:48.930
I should say.

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:51.060
So let me just
sort of emphasize,

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.080
there are occasional
moments in this class where

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.130
if you're dozing off a little
bit, I suggest you pop up

01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:00.800
and tattoo this into
a neuron somewhere.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.090
This is one of those moments.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.330
OK?

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:04.670
This is a result that we're
going to use over and over

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:06.380
and over again,
because this holds--

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.840
this isn't just in
special relativity.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.230
When we start talking about
the behavior of things

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.120
near black holes,
there's going to a place

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.150
where I basically at
that point to say,

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.567
well, I'm going to use the
fact that the observer measures

01:11:17.567 --> 01:11:20.150
an energy that is given by-- and
I'm going to write down that.

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:22.317
The dot product that's
involved is a little bit more

01:11:22.317 --> 01:11:24.170
complicated, because
my metric is hairier.

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.470
But it's the exact
same physical concept.

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:28.130
OK?

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:29.720
Let me just do one more.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.260
And then I'll go talk,
without getting into the math,

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.900
about what I will
start with on Tuesday.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.810
Last 4-velocity, which
is probably useful for us

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:49.795
to quickly talk about is--

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:56.170
so we've talked a
lot about 4-velocity.

01:11:56.170 --> 01:11:57.952
That is just one
piece-- when we're

01:11:57.952 --> 01:12:00.160
talking about sort of the
kinematics of bodies moving

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.290
in spacetime, you need more
information than just velocity.

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:03.748
Sometimes things
are moving around.

01:12:03.748 --> 01:12:06.980
There's additional
forces acting on them.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.540
And so we also care
about the 4-acceleration.

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:29.300
And so this is what
I get when I take

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.520
the derivative with respect to
proper time of the 4-velocity.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.700
So will there be some homework
exercises that use this.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.340
The main thing which I want to
emphasize to sort of conclude

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:43.610
our calculations for
today is that when

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.850
I talk about a 4-velocity
of acceleration,

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.820
this has an extremely
important property.

01:12:49.820 --> 01:13:02.060
It is always the case that
a dotted into u equals 0.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.650
If you're used to sort of
3-dimensional intuition,

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.210
that may seem weird.

01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:12.230
OK?

01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:15.760
Anytime you see a car
accelerate from a stop, that's

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.620
a case in which its
acceleration is clearly not

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.110
orthogonal to its velocity.

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:24.710
But the issue here is, this
is not a spatial dot product.

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.750
This is a space
time dot product.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.880
And some of your intuition
has to go out the window

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.830
because of that.

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:32.090
It's very simple to prove this.

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:37.430
Remember, u dot
u equals minus 1.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:46.110
So d of u dot u, d
tau, which is just 2, u

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:53.120
dot a is the derivative
of minus 1, which is 0.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.880
OK?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.320
So this is something
that we will exploit.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.210
If you want to describe
the relativistic kinetics

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:04.140
of an accelerating body,
this is a great thing

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.565
that we can use to exploit.

01:14:05.565 --> 01:14:07.440
You often need a little
bit more information.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.900
We have to give you as a bit
of additional information

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.442
some knowledge about what the
orientation of the acceleration

01:14:12.442 --> 01:14:13.905
is and things like that.

01:14:13.905 --> 01:14:15.030
So whenever you are given--

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:16.290
I'll get to you in just
a sec-- whenever you're

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:18.780
given any kind of differential
quantity like this,

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.330
it's not enough to know-- it's
like the acceleration of loss,

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:23.080
you have to also have
boundary conditions.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.110
And that sort of tells you
what the initial direction is.

01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.610
Question?

01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:29.040
AUDIENCE: Is that time
still the proper time?

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.050
SCOTT HUGHES: That time
is the proper time, yes.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.410
AUDIENCE: So it's
not accelerating?

01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:33.400
SCOTT HUGHES: That's right.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.880
So you can still define a
proper time for an accelerating

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.420
observer.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.605
It will not relate--

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.880
hold that thought.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.960
You're going to play
this a little bit more

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.070
in a future problem set.

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:45.690
I mean, the key thing
is that the way--

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:49.310
if you have an d observer,
an interval of proper time

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.950
as compared to an interval of
time for, you know, someone

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:55.670
in a rest frame that sees
this person accelerate away,

01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:58.020
the conversion between
the intervals of time,

01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.260
the two measure, it evolves.

01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:05.540
So, you know, let's say
you're in this room with me.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.680
In fact, it turns out
that if you accelerate

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.100
at 1G for a year,
you get to very

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.960
close to the speed of light.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.910
So let's say that you
were in a rocket ship

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:19.780
right now that launched with an
acceleration of G. Initially,

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.990
you and I synchronize
our watches.

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:24.840
And so an interval
of a second to me

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.560
is the same as a second to you.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.742
Half a year later, you're
moving at something

01:15:28.742 --> 01:15:29.950
like half the speed of light.

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:33.490
And I will see a
noticeable time delay.

01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:35.290
An interval of a second
as you measure it

01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:38.415
looks long compared to me.

01:15:38.415 --> 01:15:39.790
Six months later,
you're actually

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:40.870
quite close to the
speed of light,

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.120
and it gets dilated even more.

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:46.270
So last thing, which
I'm going to say,

01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:49.570
and I'm not going to get into
too much detail with this yet,

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:56.400
is we're going to begin
next time by making

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.120
a little bit more formal some
of the notions that go around.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.420
So we've increased some
physics and some vectors.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:10.120
I've given you guys one tensor
so far, the metric tensor.

01:16:16.025 --> 01:16:17.650
And so I'm going to
give you-- in fact,

01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:22.068
I will write down a very precise
definition of this right now,

01:16:22.068 --> 01:16:23.860
and we'll pick it up
from there on Tuesday.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.843
So the basic idea--
so you guys have see--

01:16:25.843 --> 01:16:28.135
the one tensor you've seen
so far is the metric tensor.

01:16:28.135 --> 01:16:31.570
And what the metric is is it's
sort of a mathematical object

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:34.720
that I put in a
pair of 4-vectors.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.410
And it spits out a quantity
that is a Lorenz invariant

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:42.040
scalar that characterizes
what we call the inner product

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.680
of those two 4-vectors.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.080
More generally,
I'm going to define

01:16:47.080 --> 01:17:12.110
a tensor of type 0 N as a
function or mapping of N

01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:34.920
4-vectors into Lorenz invariant
scalars, which is linear

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.664
in each of its N arguments.

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:52.360
So I will pick it
up here on Tuesday.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:58.160
And let me just say in words,
the metric is a 0 2 tensor.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.770
I put in two 4-vectors.

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.860
It spits out a Lorenz
invariant scalar.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.770
We're going to before
too long come up

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:11.120
with a couple of things that
involve three real vectors--

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.930
excuse me three 4-vectors,
too many numbers here,

01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:18.170
a trio of 4-vectors, which it
then maps to a Lorenz invariant

01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:19.010
scalar.

01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:21.770
Some of them will
take in four 4-vectors

01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:23.900
and produce a Lorenz
invariant scalar.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.940
Notice I wrote this
in sort of funny way.

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:30.100
The 0 N sort of begs for
there to be sort of an N 0.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:30.950
OK?

01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:34.010
To do that I have to
introduce an object that

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.718
is sort of dual to a vector.

01:18:35.718 --> 01:18:37.010
We're going to talk about that.

01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.080
Those are objects
called one-forms,

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.450
which actually happen to
be a species of vector.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.210
We're actually going to then
learn that the vector is itself

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.590
a tensor.

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:48.343
And so we will make a very
general classification

01:18:48.343 --> 01:18:49.010
of these things.

01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:52.190
And we'll see that vectors are
just a subset of these tensors.

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:55.340
And at last, we'll sort of have
all the mathematics in place.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.380
We can sort of lose some
of these distinctions

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.810
and just life goes on,
and we can start actually

01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.220
doing some physics with these.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:04.330
All right, I will pick
it up there on Tuesday.

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:26.210
PROFESSOR: I'm excited, because
I'm going to get the chance

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.260
to co-teach today with--

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.479
I would say one of the
students, but it's not really

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.312
one of the students.

00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:37.370
But Larry Lessig has consented
to join us in a few minutes.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.800
So I'm going to be
breezing through

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.390
a little faster than usual.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
And then we'll co-teach this.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.360
Blockchain and Money.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.960
Here we are.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.520
We're at smart contracts.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.320
Everybody seems
to be coming back,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.670
which is a sign of your interest
more than it is in my teaching.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.990
But I thank you for being here.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.750
We made it through
the last three classes

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.790
together on bitcoin and the
basics of that technology.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.630
And in one class,
we're going to try

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.300
to chew off a bit
on smart contracts,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.370
both the technology side, a
little bit on the markets,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.260
and then the law that Larry
is going to take us through.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.453
And so as I said,
I want to start

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.120
with a little
administrative, because we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.230
are on the sixth class.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.210
I'm going to review a bit about
the projects very quickly.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.730
We're going to do smart
contracts, the design.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.590
What design features?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.450
Yes, we're going to
go back a little bit

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.340
about hash functions and
Merkle trees but not too much.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.310
DApps, which are basically
decentralized applications,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.430
and token sales.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.990
Larry's going to take
us through legal issues,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.330
and then we'll sum it all up.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.240
So let me just, real fast on
the administrative side again--

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840
class participation, 30%.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.510
That's why we're
all here together.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.330
That means, hopefully,
reading the assignments

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.710
and participating.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.500
About half of you
have participated,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.199
so I guess I'm going to
go with a little bit more

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.940
cold calling starting Thursday.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.190
I'm not going to do a bunch
of it today, because Larry

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.480
and I are joining.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.860
So you can ease off.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.550
But really be conscious.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.190
If you haven't been
participating, try to get in

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.990
and join the conversation
and discussion.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.790
The two individual write-ups,
I think we have seven.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.700
But it's quite possible some
of you have submitted already.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.890
It's just meant to be
critical business reasoning.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.070
We are in a business school.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.720
To the extent you just
summarize some readings,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.220
I'm sure we'll give
you a pass on that.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.720
But that's not what
I'm looking for.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.690
I'm really looking
for critical reasoning

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.380
and thinking from a
business perspective

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.700
of, why does this matter?

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.620
What are its strengths
or its values

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.280
in terms of business reasoning
and critical reasoning?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.540
One by the 10th class, one by
the 23rd, always before class.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.800
What it likely means
is we'll be getting

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.200
most of these on the
8th, 9th, and 10th class.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.640
I know how that
works and so forth.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.580
And that's OK.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.460
That's OK.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.220
But I'm just
reminding you of that.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.540
In terms of the
group research paper,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.080
again, Sabrina and Thalita
stood up a Google App--

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.970
I think it's in Google, but--

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.190
where you can go in and team
up in teams of three or four.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.620
It's not required to do this by
the eighth class next Tuesday,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.400
but I'm strongly
suggesting it to figure out

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.300
who your teams are and not sort
of wait till the second half

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.590
of the semester.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.330
And I'd like to
encourage everybody

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.528
to choose an area for
your use case by midway.

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:52.070
Again, you're not
going to get graded

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.010
if it takes you another class
or two to figure it out.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.060
But I just think it's much
better if you know your teams,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.400
you know what your
use case will be.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.450
If it's not about finance--

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.070
one group has already asked
me if that's all right.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.550
I just want to know more
detailed what it's going to be.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.180
I'm probably going
to say yes, but it

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.589
needs a little
bit of preapproval

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.180
if it's outside of finance.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.310
So any questions about
the requirements?

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.160
I just wanted to--

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.470
So the study questions.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.090
Today's smart contracts
and basically how they

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.840
compare to regular contracts.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.900
And what are the tokens that
are used within that ecosystem?

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.110
And what are the platforms?

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.270
In a very similar sense to the
internet, we have the internet.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.750
And then above the internet,
you have, you might say,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.570
applications--

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.200
Facebook and other applications.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.310
Well, this, too, has
a series of platforms

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.010
and then decentralized
applications

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.810
potentially on top of that.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.643
And basically, a quick touch
on decentralized applications.

00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:14.060
Later in the
semester, we're going

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.300
to take two sessions on
initial coin offerings.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.980
And thus, we're going to talk
a lot about token economics.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.500
So this will be just
the first taste test,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.660
and then we'll come
back to it later.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.770
And then the readings,
hopefully, everybody

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.800
read through "Smart Contracts."

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.050
I thought the Chamber
of Digital Commerce,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.850
even though this is
almost two years ago,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.260
this paper was a very
helpful sort of flavor

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.400
for what folks in
commerce are thinking

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.140
and what developers
were thinking.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.920
And I love that Nick Szabo
wrote the introduction to it.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.670
And it's interesting
to see and question,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.890
why is it that it's
two years later,

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.890
and many of those use cases
are still being discussed

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.940
but haven't fully been adopted?

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.480
And then the "State
of the Dapps,"

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.712
and then who are the
competitors to Ethereum?

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:11.670
So don't you feel good?

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.540
I haven't asked anybody
a cold question yet.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.810
And then the optional
readings, I don't know.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.040
Did anybody actually go back?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.748
They're optional.

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:24.120
Did anybody go back and read
either Szabo's original piece

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.350
from 20 years ago
on smart contracts?

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.240
Oh, a few of you are kind
of into that rabbit hole

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.580
of blockchain and ether.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.740
Brotish what did you think of--
it's 20 years ago he wrote this

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.760
thing on--

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.130
Nick Szabo wrote this thing.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.850
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I spent more time

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.340
on the Ethereum white paper.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.590
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.095
So what did you think about
the Ethereum white paper one?

00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:47.887
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
it was pretty good.

00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:50.140
It gave me a very good
overview of the world potential

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.203
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.930
And what's interesting is
even if you didn't do it

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.210
for the class and you find
yourself more and more

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.170
interested in this over the next
couple of months or even later,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.540
going back and reading
the Ethereum white paper,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.840
it's not highly technical
in the first, I don't know,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.400
10 or 15 pages.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.110
It really gives a
history of bitcoin.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.350
It talks about
distributed applications

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:21.040
and largely written at the
time by a 19-year-old, as well.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.840
It's a remarkable thing.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.470
And then one of Larry's
colleague, or maybe it's

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.320
two of them, but De
Philippi paper, as well,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.520
on the regulatory issues.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.610
So let me talk a little
bit about smart contracts

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.960
and laying groundwork before
Larry gives us the law.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.650
A smart contract is
a set of promises

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.350
specified in a digital form.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.680
I'm going to say four things.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.640
It's just a set of
promises in a digital form.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.070
So it's not handwritten out.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.330
It includes protocols.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.825
What's a protocol?

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:00.325
Andrew.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:07.580
AUDIENCE: Standard
operating procedure.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.770
PROFESSOR: Standard
operating procedure.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.530
I like that.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.450
Anybody else give me
another word for it, maybe?

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.610
An algorithm.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.480
So a set of promises
in digital form.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.970
But it can include math,
basically, if you wish

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.560
or standard operating
procedures-- if-then statements

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.380
and so forth.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.375
And the parties then perform
against these promises.

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:37.000
And guess what?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.640
Nick Szabo wrote that in 1996.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.770
And I thought it was
still probably the best

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.140
definition of smart contract.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.440
He coined the
phrase 22 years ago.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.900
He might actually
be Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.330
Three of the tables
in here, you all

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.770
voted that it was Nick Szabo.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.990
So I thought that's kind
of the best definition

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.650
if you've got to
just-- kind of a root.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.490
Now, I would also say, however,
that smart contracts may not

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.657
be so smart.

00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:09.490
A lot of people have
come to be calling them

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.950
dumb contracts that
are just algorithms

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.170
that perform a function.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.920
So don't think of them as
artificial intelligence.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.710
That's another class provided
next semester by Simon Johnson.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.900
Think of them almost
as just dumb contracts.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.050
And in a sense,
they're mechanizing

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.280
what might otherwise be done
amongst and between humans.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280
And smart contracts may or
may not be really contracts.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.210
And that's why Larry's
going to speak to it.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.370
So remember, even though Nick
Szabo calls it smart contracts,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.010
they may not be smart, and
they may not be contracts.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.260
So a little bit about
the technical features.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.250
Remember our three
ways we did this.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.150
What are the big technical
features that we studied?

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.270
I'm sorry to do this.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.840
Anton, what are the
three big buckets?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.200
Remember, we took three
classes and three buckets

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.070
of information.

00:10:10.794 --> 00:10:12.525
It can be one to three.

00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:13.490
AUDIENCE: Cryptography.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.490
PROFESSOR: Cryptography.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:14.990
Great.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.810
You got one.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.000
Two other people will
give me the others.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.890
So cryptography.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:20.430
Guess what?

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.090
Bitcoin and Ethereum all
have the same cryptography.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.760
It's not identical.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.970
But for the purposes
of design features,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.510
it has cryptographic hashes,
timestamps, block headers,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.760
Merkle trees.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.760
Though Ethereum has more than
one Merkle tree, and bitcoin

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.460
has one.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.250
And it has digital
signatures and addresses.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.240
So everything we
talked about three

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.950
lectures ago about cryptography,
both forms of blockchains.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.730
Anybody want to give me
what our second bucket was?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.950
Geramo.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.310
AUDIENCE: Decentralization.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.590
PROFESSOR: Decentralization.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.570
What else did we talk about?

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.070
Eilon.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.903
AUDIENCE: Consensus.

00:11:03.903 --> 00:11:05.250
PROFESSOR: Consensus.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:10.310
So again, decentralized
network consensus.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.740
Ethereum actually
uses proof of work

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.770
even there's some
talk that Ether

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.870
will move to proof of stake.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.030
But it's currently
proof of work.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.280
There is a native currency.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.750
It's ETH, or "eh-th," or E-T-H,
or Ether, instead of bitcoin.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.220
And it has a network.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.080
The third thing that
we talked about, Alpha.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.520
AUDIENCE: Transaction format.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.840
PROFESSOR: Transaction format.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.290
So we talked about
transactions and script.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.240
Well, guess what?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.030
Ethereum does not have a
transaction script or UTXO.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.850
So that's the one place
that Vatalik Buterin, who

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.020
designed all of this, said
no, had to go a different way.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.070
Instead of transaction
inputs and outputs,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.260
there's something called
state transitions.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.518
Isabella, ledgers.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.310
What are the two
different types of ledgers

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.355
that we talked about
and set a class to?

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:14.066
AUDIENCE: Permissioned
and public.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:17.010
PROFESSOR: So
permissioned and public

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.660
are two different
types of blockchains.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.100
Remind me your name again.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.053
Stephanie.

00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:25.750
AUDIENCE: Balance ledgers
and transaction ledgers.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.625
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:28.440
So balance ledger and
transaction ledger.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.650
You can keep a list
of transactions.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.638
And this goes back
thousands of years.

00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:34.680
This is not a blockchain.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.080
Or you can keep balances.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.080
Bitcoin is, in essence,
a transaction ledger.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.730
Ethereum and many of
the other smart contract

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.490
platforms are balance ledgers.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.500
There's a lot of technological
and mathematical reasons why,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.160
which I'd be glad to
do in office hours.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.220
But because of that,
when you're moving

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.870
from one set of balances, like--

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.170
is it Bo?

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:11.260
Bo has $100 at Bank of
America to Bo having $101.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.150
You need to have a transition.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.050
It's called a state transition,
which would mean add $1.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.580
So Ethereum is account based
and, in fact, doesn't even

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.500
have one programming language.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.840
There's six or seven
programming languages

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.970
you can write in, for
those who are so inclined.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:38.570
So I'm going to go through
really quickly my analysis,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.370
and many other
people's, but my sort

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.820
of rendition of the difference
between Ethereum and bitcoin.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.380
But stop me if
there's a question.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.750
So the founder.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.400
There's actually a founder.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.450
The mythology around
Vatalik Buterin

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.870
might not be as great
as Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:00.500
But a 19-year-old journalist who
was writing about bitcoin for--

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.850
was it Bitcoin Magazine, if I
remember where he was writing--

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.190
said, we can build
something on top

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.630
of it using Nick Szabo's
thoughts about smart contracts,

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.135
about six years after bitcoin.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.860
He made it Turing complete.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.670
Does anyone want to remind the
class what Turing complete is?

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.720
Did I see a hand up?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.890
Yes.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.455
Bold of you.

00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:27.663
What's your first name again?

00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:28.390
AUDIENCE: Alana.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.448
PROFESSOR: Alana.

00:14:29.448 --> 00:14:31.490
AUDIENCE: You could write
pretty much any-- well,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.782
you can write loops, but you
write any kind of program,

00:14:33.782 --> 00:14:35.890
like any form of
logic is expressed.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.800
PROFESSOR: So Alana
says Turing complete

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.150
means you can write loops.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.440
But what that really means
for the business crowd is it

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.260
means you can write a program
to do just about anything.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.180
It's highly flexible.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.700
I'm sure the technologist in
here will say, well, maybe

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.710
there's something
you can't do with it.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.170
But the point in
what Vatalik said

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.920
is we shouldn't just limit it
to a scripting language that

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.500
was non-Turing
complete that can just

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.310
move a little bit of
peer-to-peer value around,

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:11.100
that he wanted to do basically
a peer-to-peer virtual computer

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.310
that could move code
and complete code.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.980
And over the years,
it's being able to be

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.320
written in a bunch of things.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.810
But Solidity is the
main program language.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.170
And thus, it's account based
rather than transaction

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.510
based because of the loops.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.620
If you could loop and be Turing
complete with transactions,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.770
there is a vulnerability
in attack factors

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.320
that he made it account based.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.015
The transactions are
stored in Merkle keys.

00:15:42.015 --> 00:15:42.640
But guess what?

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.220
If you were really interested
and wanted to learn everything

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.670
about Ethereum, there's at
least four key Merkle trees

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.780
that get summarized up
into the block headers.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.420
There's the transactions,
which, in essence,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.500
aren't transactions.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.780
They call them
state transitions.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.480
There's the state
itself, something

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.420
called storage, which is
really related to each one

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.390
of the individual Ethereum
accounts, and then,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.670
believe it or not,
actually, receipts.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.700
There's written records of
receipts from every state

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.530
transition.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.400
So there's a lot more complexity
inside the Ethereum blockchain.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.510
They run about 14 seconds a
block instead of 10 minutes.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.600
And that change is a
bunch of the economics.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.010
Proof of work, for some
reason, which others can study.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.450
Vatalik decided to use a
different hash function.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.760
It's still based on
elliptic curves, I think,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.840
but a different hash function.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.760
What about the economics?

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.680
Well, it's called ETH or E-T-H.
It's programmed in such a way

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.210
that you can't use
ASICs, purposely

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.840
makes it that mining
is more decentralized,

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.580
and you don't have
the big factories.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.360
The entire hash community,
the entire mining community,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.770
is much smaller.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:06.988
In fact, I think it's about--

00:17:06.988 --> 00:17:07.780
what would that be?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.270
200,000 times smaller.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:15.280
There's 260 terahashes per
second as of yesterday.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:21.230
And the bitcoin mining
community has 54 exahashes.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.900
That means lots more computers,
a lot more electricity,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.490
a lot more gnashing of
teeth about resources.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.060
Bitcoin started in
January of 2009.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.920
And nobody owned any bitcoin,
whereas Ethereum started

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.955
with a presale and an ICO,
which we'll be talking about,

00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:44.530
about 72 million Ethereum.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.950
Vatalik wanted to raise money
he was maybe 19 years old.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.870
He looped in with a
venture capitalist

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.460
from Canada, Joe Lubin,
who now runs ConsenSys.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.640
Lubin took about 10% or 9
and 1/2% of the offering.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.990
They put 9 and 1/2%
in a foundation

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.720
called the Ethereum Foundation.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.930
And the other 80% was sold to
the public for $18 million.

00:18:10.732 --> 00:18:12.670
We'll talk later
in the semester as

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.100
to whether that was really
a securities offering.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:20.110
I've publicly said I think
so, but that was in 2014.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.170
And in 2018, the Securities
and Exchange Commission

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.680
has said regardless of why
it might have been in '14,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.840
it's now sufficiently
decentralized

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.300
that we'll consider
it not a security.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.280
But in essence, they
raised $18 million

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.046
and were off to the races.

00:18:37.046 --> 00:18:41.810
Oh, and the 10% that Joe Lubin
kept, if he still owned it,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.100
would be worth about
$2 billion now.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.180
But he probably sold
some of it along the way.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.090
There are block rewards.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.690
The monetary policy in
Ethereum, if you remember,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.900
it splits every four years.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.570
There's the block reward splits.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.860
Ethereum was set up that it
was five Ether per block.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.050
And then a year ago,
they just announced

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.760
they were going to
change the software

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.040
to three Ether per block.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.720
And a month ago, they
announced they're

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.760
going to change it to
two Ether per block.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.500
So the monetary policy of
bitcoin is said to be immutable

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.210
and fixed forever.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.750
But I would say that because
Ethereum supposedly was fixed

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.800
and now, twice, they've
changed the monetary policy,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.240
there is a form that if all
the miners and all the computer

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.420
nodes decide, they can
change the monetary policy.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.050
And Ethereum has shown that.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.750
I think Ethereum's a
bit more centralized

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.990
and has more leadership,
because Vatalik Buterin

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.820
is an actual human who is
willing to disclose who he is.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.730
And he still has the sort
of founder following.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.650
And Satoshi Nakamoto went--

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.440
he ghosted all of
us, in a sense.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.910
And so thus, it's in some
ways socially just more

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.050
decentralized.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.950
And then fees are
voluntary in bitcoin.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.880
They're a necessary part
to channel everything.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.380
Emily.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.150
AUDIENCE: Going back
to monetary policy,

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.360
in practice, what
does it actually mean

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.850
for a difference between bitcoin
and Ethereum that it's fixed

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.440
but changing versus
staying at the same rate?

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.860
PROFESSOR: So Emily asks,
what does it mean in practice?

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:33.300
In practice, bitcoin has a much
slower growth rate or inflation

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:40.230
rate, which is currently, if
I'm not mistaken, about half.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.130
What's that?

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.190
About 4%.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.590
But it's about half of the
inflation rate at Ethereum,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.830
which is running
in the 7% range.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.670
Every one of the
1,600 live tokens

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.500
that are right
now Ott coins have

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.210
separate monetary policies.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.220
And one could do a
complete economic study

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.660
about what it means.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.970
But in terms of
Ethereum versus bitcoin,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.140
Ethereum has a higher
inflation rate.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.270
And secondly,
because they've shown

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.650
that they can form some
consensus and change it,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.780
I think it sends an
interesting question

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:21.780
into that ecosystem as to how
hard a monetary policy versus

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:27.130
a more human-based,
flexible monetary policy.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.180
Hugo.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.840
AUDIENCE: So is it that the
core developers of the Ethereum

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.822
blockchain decide?

00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:36.280
I'm not familiar with how they
make that decision to change

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.520
the monetary policy.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.350
PROFESSOR: So the core
developers of any coin

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.560
can propose to the
various mining and nodes

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.510
to make a change, including
the monetary policy.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.290
Even in bitcoin,
the monetary policy

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.230
could change if
there was a proposal

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.300
from the core developers.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.480
In the Ethereum case,
they have done that twice.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.160
The core development
of Ethereum is

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.720
highly concentrated around
the Ethereum Foundation.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.110
ConsenSys, the company
that Joe Lubin runs,

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.970
has some normative social
standing in the community,

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.070
as well.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.650
But it's been part of proposals.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:25.780
And in reading the proposals, it
goes back to Emily's question.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.540
The core developers have said we
should bring down the inflation

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.350
rate.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.570
There's an active advocacy to
bring down the inflation rate.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.000
AUDIENCE: So you go by
updating your node software?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.790
PROFESSOR: Yes, in essence.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.880
And it could lead to a
hard fork, I believe.

00:22:42.588 --> 00:22:43.630
So that's the background.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.172
Let me just talk
about the platforms.

00:22:45.172 --> 00:22:47.230
We know about Ethereum.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.550
We've just chatted about it.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.910
Its actual current market
value is $22 billion.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.490
While we're not going to spend
a lot of time in this class

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.080
this semester about
market values,

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.538
I thought it would
give you a sense

00:22:57.538 --> 00:22:58.870
of how people think about it.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.240
The other five that you
did some reading about.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.260
EOS, whose market value
is about $5 billion,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.070
is so new, because they just
finished an initial coin

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.900
offering in July.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.770
And they just went live in July.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.950
But they raised $4.2 billion.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.900
So my estimate, my prediction,
is EOS is going to be real

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.030
and going to be around.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.360
They've taken $1 billion
of that $4.2 billion

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.370
and set up a Kickstarter
sort of venture firm

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.570
literally so that they could
maybe support some of you.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.110
You could be knocking on
the EOS venture firm's door

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.610
and saying fund me.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.750
I've got a great idea.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.450
And they'd have one
condition, amongst others.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.570
You'd have to use
EOS as the platform.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.440
So it's a self-reinforcing
business model.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.320
NEO is the other big
one that I'd mention,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.640
which was started two years ago
out of China, a lot of people

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.280
think with the backing of
the Chinese government.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.000
Even if not officially,
certainly with the verbal

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.900
and help of there.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.440
Some people think of it
as the Ethereum of China,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.420
but it does use a
different proof of work.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.670
And those are the main ones.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.870
Ethereum Classic is
there because there

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:25.660
was a hard fork off of Ethereum
after the DAO circumstance.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.490
Any quick questions
about the platforms?

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.910
And NEO and EOS
are thought to be

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.030
a little bit higher
throughput and faster because

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.720
of the different proof of
work that each of them have.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.626
So maybe they're more scalable
than Ethereum long term.

00:24:43.626 --> 00:24:44.792
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:44.792 --> 00:24:45.750
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.810
PROFESSOR: So Hugo is pointing
out that neither one truly

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:50.310
use--

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:55.710
NEO and EOS truly use
decentralized proof of work.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:00.630
They use a delegated
Byzantine fault tolerance.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:01.800
This was from the reading.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.300
We're not going to
spend time on it.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:08.730
But there was 12 use cases that
the Digital Chamber of Commerce

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:09.322
came up with.

00:25:09.322 --> 00:25:11.280
And we're going to study
most of these, not all

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.613
of these, later in the semester.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.700
Please tell me, Sean.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.890
AUDIENCE: So from the
growth perspective

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.680
across different
platforms, do you

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.520
support multi programming
language platforms as opposed

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.962
to single-language
programming platforms?

00:25:31.962 --> 00:25:35.700
Which one do you think
has more potential?

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.690
PROFESSOR: The question is,
do multi-language platforms

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.230
have more potential or less
than single-language platforms?

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.660
I haven't done a real study.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.190
My gut tells me that
there's some trade-offs.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.010
So a multi-language
platform probably

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.620
allows for more
development of apps,

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.170
just like on the
internet, if you

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:00.040
can have more app development.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.770
Though if you have only
one single language,

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.490
you might have fewer
vulnerabilities,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.060
vulnerabilities either
to attack or coming down.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.050
So there's probably
some trade-offs.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:19.870
And I'm more into
democratizing capital markets,

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.550
so probably my biases
would be to the ones that

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.560
have multi-language potential.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.830
But I can't say for sure
whether it will necessarily

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.330
win, because there are some
trade-offs, if that helps.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.170
So we'll take a view of all of
these later in the semester.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.790
But what's interesting is none
of them have yet taken off.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:45.440
And in fact, if you
look at the dApps today,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.690
the decentralized
applications which

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.080
run on a decentralized
blockchain,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.510
they generally
have native tokens.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.880
They don't have to have a
native token, by the way.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.380
You can run a dApp
based on Ether.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.930
You could run a dApp
on an underlying token.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.260
But they almost always have
their own native token.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.200
This is a list that I pulled
off the internet yesterday

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.550
similar to your reading.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.090
These are the actual dApps
that are working the highest--

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.520
gaming, gambling,
exchanges, and finance.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.200
The most active dApp
is a gambling site that

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.050
only has 1,500 users a day.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.550
In the last 24 hours--

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.000
I pulled this down yesterday,
so that was a Monday.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.670
So this would have been
Sunday night to Monday night.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.980
There was only 1,500 users to
the most active gambling site.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.960
CryptoKitties that
some of you might know

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.890
had 418 users in those 24 hours.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:53.360
These are not economy
wise use cases.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.810
You would see numbers that
were hundreds of thousands.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.440
Or if it's like Facebook,
there's two billion members.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.140
And probably in any 24 hours,
there's a half a billion

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.390
to a billion people that
check in on Facebook.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:07.610
So these are pretty
limited at this stage.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.718
But it has led to something
called initial coin

00:28:09.718 --> 00:28:11.260
offerings, which
we're going to study

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.270
a bunch later in the semester.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.470
Initial coin offerings raise
money to build a network.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:22.290
But the tokens are usually
issued before they're usable.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.430
And a token is some
native currency

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.620
to be used on a network.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:32.160
The development is open
but highly centralized.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.310
The promoters usually
give themselves some skin

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.130
in the game or some vig.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.430
In the Ethereum
initial coin offering,

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.180
the Foundation kept 10%.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.580
Joe Lubin kept 10%.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.950
And the other 80% was
sold to the public.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:52.290
But some keep 60% or
80% for themselves.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.160
I mean, it's a whole wide
range of economic incentives

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.940
and models.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.000
And the tokens are usually
fungible and transferable.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.820
And thus, you can sort
put them on an exchange

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.000
and try to sell them
and promote them.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.500
And again, we're
going to come back.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.720
But I thought if we're
talking about smart contracts,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.740
they tie into initial
coin offerings.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.540
Daniel.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.710
AUDIENCE: If the tokens
aren't functional,

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.342
what goes into their evaluation?

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:23.050
PROFESSOR: That is an
excellent question.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.750
Daniel says, what goes into
the valuation of something

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.050
that is not functional?

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.810
And there are many
things that go in.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.900
Ultimately, it's
in the anticipation

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.010
of the potential profit and
appreciation in the future.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.770
So if you were just
to have a laundromat,

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.560
a corner laundromat
here in Cambridge,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.650
you probably would only pay
for the laundromat token what

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:53.920
you thought the value was to do
your laundry, $0.75 or whatever

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.220
the--

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:59.290
frankly, I don't know what the
tokens go for in Cambridge.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.410
You're going to tell me what
a laundromat token goes for?

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.650
But if it's prefunctional
and the laundromat has not

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:11.190
been built yet and you have
confidence it will be built,

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.440
you'll probably discount back.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.845
You might pay $0.50 instead
of the $0.75, ultimately.

00:30:17.845 --> 00:30:20.220
If you think it's going to be
a really popular laundromat

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.360
and it's going to be the place
to be seen by all MIT students

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.270
and you think that token
might one day be worth $5,

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.670
then you're starting
to speculate

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.710
on the community's interest.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.660
So these tokens, if you
really believe in them,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.480
you're trying to pay
for what others will

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.280
pay for them in the future.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.830
And the economic equilibrium
would be discounted.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.720
So thus, you're buying
it because you think

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.357
they'll appreciate in value.

00:30:48.357 --> 00:30:50.190
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
make an argument sort

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.710
of following
numismatics, how people

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.320
assign some aesthetic
value to physical coins?

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.890
So, too, you could
have an impulse

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.182
beyond speculation [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:00.182 --> 00:31:01.432
PROFESSOR: Your first name is?

00:31:01.432 --> 00:31:02.130
AUDIENCE: Isaac.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:02.838
PROFESSOR: Isaac.

00:31:02.838 --> 00:31:08.400
Isaac says maybe there could
be a numismatic or other value

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.090
to it.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.380
It's possible.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.140
I mean, certainly,
CryptoKitties caught

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.620
into the whole
collectibles wave.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:20.550
Let me try to wrap up so that
I can hand it off to Larry.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.670
So there's been
$28 billion raised

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.340
per one website, Elementis.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.930
Others that track
it think it's only

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.540
between $20 and $25 billion.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.620
There are no official arithmetic
and no official records.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.880
But the $28 billion raised
in initial coin offerings,

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.790
this is a cut of a
neat video that I just

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.400
took the last slide
of from Elementis.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.140
You can watch it in
a minute and a half.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.250
And over the years,
it's geographically

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.750
dispersed with blue
being Oceana, Australia,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.940
and so forth, green being Asia,
North America being orange.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.730
But the biggest ones,
EOS raised $4.2 billion.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.850
Telegram, $1.7
billion and the like.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.730
These are not small figures.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:15.860
There's been at least
4,500 proposed initial coin

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:16.400
offerings.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.900
Many of them didn't raise any
money, but over 2,000 to 3,000

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.670
have raised money.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.290
I'm going to use
the 3,000 figure.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:29.110
Less than half of them
are even live today.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.110
There's one study that
shows that 59% fail

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.070
within the first nine months.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:39.510
There are other studies that say
between 1/4 and 3/4 are scams.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.690
Christian Catalina
here has a study

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.060
which I think is probably
the most valid and reliable,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.720
which says 25% are
scams or frauds.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.746
Statis has one that
says 80% might be.

00:32:52.746 --> 00:32:54.347
AUDIENCE: You said 59% fail.

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.430
Can you talk more about
what "failure" means here?

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.222
Does that mean it just
goes to 0 or there's

00:32:58.222 --> 00:33:01.057
a technological deficiency?

00:33:01.057 --> 00:33:02.640
PROFESSOR: Can I
hold that until later

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.480
when we're going to dig
into these in the class?

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.710
But broad definition of fail,
so it's not just technology.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:14.400
It means that you can't even
find the website anymore.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.080
They took your
money, and they ran.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:23.520
Or they still have a
website, but it's not live.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.490
It doesn't seem like there's
a development team any longer.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.050
So multiple
definitions of failure.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.750
So that brings us
to legal issues.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.580
And as Larry brings
up his computer,

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.090
let me just introduce our guest
lecturer, Larry Lessig, who's

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.220
an esteemed Harvard
professor of law.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.140
He was at Stanford.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.380
He started something
called the Center

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.690
for Internet and Society.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.290
You clerked for
Justice Scalia, so you

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.440
must have some real views on
what's going on this week,

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.300
then.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.270
And this incredible appellate
court judge, Posner.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:04.720
And Larry also-- his first of--

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.712
whatever you're up
to, 9 or 10 books now?

00:34:06.712 --> 00:34:07.920
LARRY LESSIG: It's something.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.560
I don't know.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.690
PROFESSOR: But his first
was code and the law

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.699
that I referenced in
our first lecture.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.150
Larry is going to take it away.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.150
LARRY LESSIG: OK, great.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.120
So I'm really happy
to be able to say

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.840
that I've taught business
school students at MIT.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.179
I mean, I'm a tech wannabe.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:30.429
But I have never been allowed
to be officially here,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.980
so this is exciting.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.400
But what I want to
do is really address

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.449
what I've experienced
as misperceptions

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.000
about the nature
of the law as it

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.360
might interact with the issues
around digital contracts.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.679
So I teach contracts.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.230
Contract law is one of the
subjects which I've taught

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.630
since I started teaching.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.600
And so I want to frame
four points for you

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.550
about how to think
about contract law

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:02.055
as it relates to these
potential digital contracts.

00:35:02.055 --> 00:35:03.430
But the first
thing to do is just

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:04.720
to make sure we
understand we're all

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.040
talking about the same thing.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.540
OK.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.320
So here's what the
core of contract law

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.640
teaches us contracts are.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.130
Contract is a promise
or performance

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:22.130
given in exchange for a
promise or performance.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.770
"Given in exchange for"
is really critical.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.960
That's the quid pro
quo that's sometimes

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.950
referred to as the
consideration for the promise.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.532
But notice here,
this is mapping out

00:35:32.532 --> 00:35:33.740
four different possibilities.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.800
You can have a promise in
exchange for a promise.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.780
I promise to pay you $10,000
if you promise to sing

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.450
an opera for me tomorrow.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.150
Or it can be a promise
for a performance.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:52.100
I promise to pay you, Andy, $5
if you sing a song for us now.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.110
So it's the performance I want.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.110
I don't want a promise
from him, because we know

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.780
what Andy's promises are worth.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.670
Or it could be a
performance for a promise.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:05.350
I'll sing if you promise
to pay me after I'm done.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.330
Or the really interesting
one for our purposes

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.260
is a performance
for a performance.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.790
I'll sing if you pay me $5,000.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.290
I didn't want a promise from
you, because I don't trust you.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.730
You're business school students.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.790
So I just want the money.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.458
But I'm not promising
to do anything.

00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:25.250
I'm actually going to
do something for you.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.370
Now, that's the one
that we're going

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.407
to think about in the
context of digital contracts.

00:36:30.407 --> 00:36:30.990
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.718
Let me just fix one thing here.

00:36:34.718 --> 00:36:36.510
Actually, I was going
to make three points,

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.880
but then I decided I
was going to make four.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.672
So let me fix that.

00:36:38.672 --> 00:36:40.962
Four points about contracts.

00:36:40.962 --> 00:36:42.420
So the first point
about contracts,

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.035
so think about this case.

00:36:45.035 --> 00:36:46.830
All right.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.990
It's not quite digital, but
it's a physical contract

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:55.640
machine in the sense that it's
a performance for a performance.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.630
If you drop a dime
into this machine,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:04.590
then out will come Dr.
Pepper or something else.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.090
OK.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.960
So there's no promises involved.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.940
And we understand there's
a mechanism that's

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.180
to produce this result.
And obviously, these

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.860
have been here for a long time.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.070
And these mechanisms
provide real value,

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.920
because to the extent you
don't have to hire somebody

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.400
to stand there handing
out Dr. Peppers,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.490
you can lower the cost
of delivering Dr. Peppers

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.230
and increase the
market for Dr. Pepper.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.450
So this is the
motivation-- lower

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.430
the transaction
costs of engaging

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.980
in a particular kind
of contract, which

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.690
is performance for performance.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.190
Now, when you look
at that contract,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.750
you should ask yourself, what
are the terms of this contract?

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.250
All right.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.710
So some of them are express,
and they're pretty obvious.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.830
So this says $0.10.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:56.580
It says if you pay $0.10,
you will get the Dr. Pepper.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.020
Or that's what you
kind of expect.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.540
There's a great cartoon I
couldn't find where you come

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.860
to a machine that
says deposit $0.50.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.920
Deposits $0.50, and
the light comes on.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.690
It says, thank you very much.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:08.190
Right.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.950
So you think you know
what this contract is,

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.915
but that joke hints
that maybe you don't

00:38:13.915 --> 00:38:15.040
know what that contract is.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.610
But the express terms
of the one we expect

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.370
go with a statement,
the machine.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.630
But then there's a whole
bunch of implied terms.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:27.310
So one implied term if this
machine is in the United States

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:31.270
is that when you take the Dr.
Pepper out and you drink it,

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.000
it's actually going
to be safe to drink.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.770
It's actually going
to be Dr. Pepper.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.360
It's actually not
going to make you sick.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.350
And none of that is written
on the Dr. Pepper machine.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:45.590
That's instead a
term, a contract term,

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:51.200
that gets created by the law
and gets imposed or wrapped

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.310
around the delivery
of that drink.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.810
OK.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:57.750
That's their first point.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.125
The second point
is to think more

00:38:59.125 --> 00:39:01.220
about what these
implied terms imply.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:10.150
Because if these implied terms
are implied by a legal system,

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.700
then that means the
legal system has

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.340
an interest in your contract.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.940
Legal system is
not undisinterested

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.690
in your contract.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.370
So we should always
think that our contract

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:24.630
is going to have two parties.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.080
We call them the promisor
and the promisee.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.910
I've told you
we've had contracts

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:30.955
that can be performance.

00:39:30.955 --> 00:39:32.580
"The performancer"
isn't really a word.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.710
But let's just say
promisor and promisee.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.160
But there's always
a third party,

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.060
which is the state, who is
in the middle of the contract

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.430
in the sense that the state
will police many contracts

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:48.130
and decide whether the state
likes the contract or not.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.060
And if the state doesn't
like the contract,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.700
then the state won't
enforce the contract.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.440
Or the state might
actually punish you

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.800
because of the contract.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.380
So for example, the state cares
about the kinds of contracts.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.540
You can have contracts
for the sale of tables.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.800
You can't have contracts
for the sale of people.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.340
But you can sell dogs for
reasons I can't understand.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.310
But the point is we are
deciding which type of things

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.610
can be sold and which kind
of things can't be sold.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.780
The state cares about the
effect of the contract.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.650
If the contract is to
render your corporation

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.493
vulnerable to
bankruptcy, the state

00:40:25.493 --> 00:40:26.910
might have an
interest in deciding

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.700
whether that contract
will be enforced

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.450
or not or whether it'll
be allowed or not,

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:34.140
whether it's permissible
under bankruptcy laws

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.390
to engage in that contract
because of the risk

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.610
that it's going to create.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.900
The state's going to care about
the terms of the contract.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:48.700
So if you're selling your labor
in a state with a minimum wage

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.110
law, the state's going to care.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:54.100
Does the term that
specifies your wage equal

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.680
or exceed the minimum wage?

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.530
And states can obviously
care-- the most important thing

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.300
for the state is whether
and how the state

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.440
taxes the transaction
in the contract.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.463
So when does it tax
the transaction?

00:41:07.463 --> 00:41:09.380
What is the event that's
going to manifest it?

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.360
And of course, the
contract can try

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.148
to play with that sort of deal
with whether it will be taxed.

00:41:15.148 --> 00:41:17.690
And the state will care about
how the contract deals with it.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:18.190
OK.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:24.120
So the point is to fight
against the first real bias

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.220
that especially,
let's say, tech people

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.900
and maybe business
tech people bring

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.563
to the idea of contract law,
which is that contracts are not

00:41:32.563 --> 00:41:33.230
about the state.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.480
They're about private parties.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.230
That's not true.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.290
They're about private
parties and the state.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.470
And the state is always
going to be there.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.810
Now, so if I say
to you, I'm trying

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:46.010
to sell my parents' house.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.820
I can't sell it.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.290
So if I say to
you, I'll offer you

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:52.460
$10,000 to anyone who will
burn down my parents' house.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.752
You're trying to
accept that contract.

00:41:54.752 --> 00:41:56.960
You're raising your hand,
so you're trying to accept.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.510
I want to say officially
it's a joke so nobody gets

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.953
any uncertainty about this.

00:42:00.953 --> 00:42:02.870
Now, you're going to ask
a question, because I

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.953
didn't want you to accept.

00:42:03.953 --> 00:42:06.350
Because if you accepted
my offer, then that's it.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:06.980
I'm stuck.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.230
So now it's clear it's
not really an offer,

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.460
and I can ask you a question.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.517
AUDIENCE: So you said contracts
cannot be between two parties.

00:42:14.517 --> 00:42:16.600
They have to be between
two parties and the state.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.308
LARRY LESSIG: No.

00:42:17.308 --> 00:42:19.040
So let me say it more clearly.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.610
Contracts always have
the state present,

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.198
so it's always
between two parties

00:42:24.198 --> 00:42:25.240
or three parties or four.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.900
So you and I enter
into a contract.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.870
Not this one, but another one.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.350
But the state is in
the room and deciding

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.450
whether the state's going to
allow the contract to happen.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.450
So most contracts, the
state doesn't care about.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.370
But some contracts, the
state's going to say,

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.600
hell no, we're not going
to allow it, like this one.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.347
If you didn't get that
notice it was a joke

00:42:46.347 --> 00:42:48.430
and you thought I was
serious and you went and you

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.097
burned down my parents' house so
that we could get the insurance

00:42:51.097 --> 00:42:53.410
and not have to worry
about selling the house,

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.590
and then you came to me, and
you said, OK, pay the $10,000.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.240
And I said, it was
an obvious joke.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.850
And you went to a court,
and you said, force Lessig

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.800
to pay the $10,000.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.450
The court will say this
is an illegal contract.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.390
I'm not going to
enforce this contract.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.550
So my point is the state,
in a certain sense,

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.830
is the censor of this contract.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.640
The state is in the room
when we make this contract.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.170
And the state's
judgment about it

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.390
will decide whether
we enforce it or not.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.260
Is that clearer?

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.802
AUDIENCE: So you're not saying
the state has to be there.

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:27.010
LARRY LESSIG: I'm not saying
the state is technically

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.600
signing the document.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.550
But I'm getting you
to recognize the fact

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:35.130
that the contract is valuable
to the extent it's enforceable.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.870
And the state is the
essential agent in enforcement

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:40.365
in the real world.

00:43:40.365 --> 00:43:42.740
AUDIENCE: So I guess that's
my question, because it seems

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.510
like nowadays, we can have
contracts where the enforcement

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.380
is not the state.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.190
I can put a contract
out there that says,

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.860
hey, if you can
factor this number,

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.664
give me the prime factors of
it, I'll give you 10 Ether.

00:43:54.664 --> 00:43:55.456
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

00:43:55.456 --> 00:43:57.950
And what I started with
when I was showing you

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.100
this picture was to
say, actually, that's

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.900
been true for a while, right?

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.925
So in what sense
is the state here?

00:44:05.925 --> 00:44:08.050
Well, the state is here if
when you put the dime in

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.400
and you get the drink out and
the drink doesn't have Dr.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.467
Pepper but it has
gasoline in it,

00:44:12.467 --> 00:44:14.300
the state would come
in and say, whoa, wait.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.090
You've breached the
implied term that said

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.110
that this was safe to consume.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.980
So the state is in
this contract, too.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.680
And so what I'm trying to
lead to or get to the place

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.770
where we say, is there ever a
place where the state is not

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:33.950
there, which is what I think
your blockchain-like invocation

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:34.760
is.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.140
So that's a question we're
going to get to in a second.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.140
Here's another contract.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.570
We'll offer you $50,000 to
lobby Congress to pass HR102.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.540
This contract looks
pretty normal to us.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.870
You can imagine lobbyists
have a contract like this

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.440
all the time.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.380
In fact, in the middle
of the 19th century,

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.270
the Supreme Court
ruled this contract

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.130
was an illegal contract.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:04.590
You weren't allowed to hire
people to lobby Congress,

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:05.090
right?

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.490
So again, the
background norm of what

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:11.030
is appropriate or not for the
contract controlled what type

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.270
of contracting was allowed.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.770
OK.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.020
So that's about the
type of contract.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.160
But then think about the
terms of the contract.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.090
And so now, I want to
get you to recognize

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:25.430
the way in which the terms
that the law wants a contract

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:30.383
to have can be defeated
or not by technology.

00:45:30.383 --> 00:45:32.550
And the way I'm going to
get you to think about that

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.490
is to think about not contract
law but something that

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.530
will create the intuitions
I want you to have.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:38.880
Think about copyright law.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.440
Everybody knows
copyright law, right?

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.720
I hope you know something
about copyright law.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.310
So copyright law is a basic
contract with the state.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:51.570
But the state says, if
you create something,

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.360
then you're going to get
an exclusive right to it

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.480
or exclusive rights,
a set of rights--

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.520
an inclusive right to copy,
an exclusive right to sell it,

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.330
exclusive right to make
derivative works of it--

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.270
for a period of time--

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:10.530
and in America right now,
that's your life plus 70 years--

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.620
subject to fair
use, meaning the law

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.900
says you can't control every
use of my copyrighted work.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.480
If you want to take a book
of mine and quote a section

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.720
and write a review that says,
see how idiotic Lessig is?

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.940
You can do that.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.020
And I can't wrap the
book in a contract that

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.990
says you're not allowed to quote
it for purposes of criticizing.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:33.150
I'm just not allowed to do that.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:36.450
So copyright law, imagine
this bundle of rights

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.370
that it was offering.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:41.870
But now imagine something called
DRM, Digital Rights Management.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:42.370
All right.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:48.050
So DRM is a set of code that we
can wrap copyrighted material

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:52.040
in in the process of making
it available to others

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.183
across networks
and whatever else.

00:46:56.183 --> 00:46:57.600
It's pretty trivial
to see the way

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:03.730
DRM could, in effect, destroy
the limitations on the term.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.550
You can wrap it,
encrypt it, make it

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.860
so that my ability to
control it will be my ability

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.370
to control it, conceivably, as
long as machines are running.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.640
If it's a
Microsoft-based system,

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.360
four years later, it
won't be workable.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.680
But the point is, in
principle, it could be forever.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.630
Same thing with fair use.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.110
You can imagine it being
wrapped in a way that

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:30.470
disables the capacity
to engage in fair use.

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:36.090
So I make tons of
presentations all the time

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.030
where I need to capture video.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.240
And I was astonished
to discover the latest

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.850
round of this operating
system basically

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.000
makes it incredibly
difficult to rip

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.310
video for the purpose
of capturing even two

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.190
seconds of it.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.850
So if you have a video program
that is capturing your screen,

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:59.540
this operating system
will now disable it

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.790
for any period of
time that you're

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.110
trying to capture the screen.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.660
They've built the technology
so that, now, there

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.570
is no capacity,
technical capacity,

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.880
to engage in fair
use of copyrighted

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.880
material on the Apple platform.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.680
Now, you might say,
why should they

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.610
be allowed to do that
if the law intended

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:24.567
that the contract gives you
the free use of fair use?

00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:26.150
Why should they be
allowed to do that?

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:29.540
But that's the battle that's
been going on about DRM

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.750
ever since the beginning of
the beginning of copyrighted

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.100
work on the internet.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.630
So my point is to
get you to realize

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:42.622
the way the code becomes part
of the law of this contract.

00:48:42.622 --> 00:48:44.330
And you have to ask
yourself the question

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:49.340
whether that law is respecting
the law of the sovereign,

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.700
the law of the jurisdiction.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:54.170
So when Apple and
Disney get together

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.420
and they sell this
technology and they

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.840
sell movies across
the iTunes platform

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.710
that make it
practically impossible--

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:03.860
there's not even code.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.720
I mean, if you go out
there and you look,

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.095
you can find everybody who
says, yeah, with this version,

00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:10.410
nobody's yet found
a way to break it.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.650
So right now, we're in a
world where, right now, it's

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.260
not possible for me to
capture three seconds to put

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.840
into a presentation.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.420
And the issue that
raises is, to what extent

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.450
is that consistent
with copyright law

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:25.370
if the technology
now disables you

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.400
from doing exactly what
copyright law wants?

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.440
So this is the trade-off
to think about,

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:35.180
the relationship between the
policy that the law wants

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.130
and the policy of
the technology.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.810
And there's no reason to believe
the policy of the technology

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.575
will always be
consistent with the law.

00:49:44.575 --> 00:49:46.700
And to the extent it's not
consistent with the law,

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.660
it challenges the law.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.940
It says to the law, OK,
come out and get me.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.920
Now, that obviously
is implicated

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.420
in the context of
smart contracts,

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.550
because the biggest fear
about smart contracts

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:05.230
is that they enable a kind
of transaction that can hide

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.910
from the policy of the law.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:12.070
So the question for the law is,
what will you do to step in?

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.390
And this is, I think, where
your question was going.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.970
How does the state appear in
the middle of that contract?

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:21.760
But let's take one more
step before we get to that.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.260
OK.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.450
That's the second point.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:26.240
Here's the third point.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.330
There's often this intuition
that, especially technologists,

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.720
people have about what the
particular aim of contract law

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:31.910
is.

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.410
So in the very
beginning of me writing

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.410
about the law of cyberspace,
somebody from MIT--

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.460
I won't name any
names-- it wasn't Andy--

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.140
showed up at the Harvard
Law School and said,

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.328
I've solved the problem
of contract law.

00:50:42.328 --> 00:50:43.370
I said, what do you mean?

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.580
He said, I have a system
that will eliminate risks

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.562
in contracts.

00:50:48.562 --> 00:50:50.770
And he was really disappointed
when I said, you know,

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:54.380
the objective of contract law
is not to eliminate risks.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.010
The objective of contract
law is just to allocate risk,

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.722
to figure out who has
the risk, so each of us

00:50:59.722 --> 00:51:01.680
can figure out what to
do in light of the risk.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.540
So if I say I will buy
10,000 bushels of corn

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.520
from you at $350 a bushel--

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.680
turns out that is the
price of corn right now.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.430
He always looks up
things on the internet.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:13.000
I figure I should look it
up before I present it.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.630
So $350 is the price of a bushel
of corn right now delivered

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.120
September 1.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.610
What that's basically
doing is it's allocating

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.510
the risk of the price of corn.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.390
So if you're a
farmer and you don't

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:28.080
want to face the risk the price
of corn is going to fall to $3,

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.480
you enter into this contract.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.600
If you're a buyer, you
accept this contract.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.670
But if the price of
corn falls to $3,

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.210
well, you're out of luck.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:42.960
So the point is it
relocates the price change,

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.880
reallocates the risk
of price change,

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.500
also reallocates the
risk of delivery.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:51.210
So if I've got all this corn, I
can place it in a certain place

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.260
to shift the risk of delivery
so that, once again, I

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.350
use the contract to
shift my risk of storage

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.810
or my risk of delivery
and you on the other side.

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:03.570
So the objective of
contract law, number one,

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:06.090
is risk allocation.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:06.590
Number one.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:12.755
But allocation matters only if--

00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:14.600
trying to say only if for me--

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.120
only if there is a
system to process

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:23.470
the breach of a contract, only
if you've got a technology,

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:25.243
let's say, for
processing the breach.

00:52:25.243 --> 00:52:26.660
So if I have a
contract with you--

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:30.480
10,000 bushels of corn,
$3.50, on September 1--

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.040
and you don't deliver,
that's a breach.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.400
My risk has only
been reallocated

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.800
if there's some way
for me to enforce

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.330
the contract at that point.

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.370
So it requires the system.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.290
And the system we
ordinarily take for granted

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.680
is a legal system.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.060
And I say we take
it for granted,

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.700
meaning some people can
take it for granted,

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:56.710
like people in well-developed
legal contexts.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.250
But that's also to emphasized
other people can't take it

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.310
for granted--

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:03.580
so for example, people
in developing worlds.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.620
They can't take the
legal system for granted.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.790
They can't assume that if
the contract is breached,

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:09.873
they go into a court and
say, enforce the contract

00:53:09.873 --> 00:53:11.380
or give me damages.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.240
Or if you've got a
contract between somebody

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.982
in Rwanda and
somebody in Alaska,

00:53:15.982 --> 00:53:17.440
then there, too,
there's a question

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.210
of whether we've got sufficient
infrastructure to develop.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.010
So the point I want to
emphasize at the end

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.010
of this little
intervention is to suggest

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:30.730
that this fact that it
takes for granted the system

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:35.790
of enforcement shows the real
potential benefit of this class

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:39.220
of contracting devices.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.490
Because if we think about
this as a representation

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:44.100
of a well-developed
legal system and we

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.760
think of first-world
countries as having those

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.550
and we compare third-world
or developing world

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.490
countries, which don't have
these well-developed legal

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:58.335
systems, you might say that
first-world countries are

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:00.210
better off relative to
third-world countries,

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:01.960
because they have the
legal infrastructure

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.003
to enable this risk
allocation that will enable

00:54:04.003 --> 00:54:06.420
all sorts of market transactions
to happen which otherwise

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.170
wouldn't happen.

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:12.430
But if we imagine
infrastructure like

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.710
blockchain-like
infrastructures or Ethereum

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.190
infrastructures
to enter the mix,

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.530
providing a technical
infrastructure that

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:24.910
doesn't require judges and
lawyers but just requires code,

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:30.910
then that can substitute for
the legal infrastructure,

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.760
provide the infrastructure
the contract needs

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.520
at a much lower cost,
and thereby enable

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:41.380
people to contract who otherwise
wouldn't rationally contract,

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.730
because they could never
count on the infrastructure

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:49.730
of the legal system to
deliver what they need.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:50.230
OK.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.510
So the point is this
picture is trying

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:57.430
to say that one key value
of these technologies

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:00.370
is that they will be a
substitute for a failed

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.460
legal system or a legal system
that's not yet developed.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.890
They will provide
the infrastructure

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.350
of a legal system or
the legal systems.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:11.110
AUDIENCE: How can they
really do anything?

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.540
Because you can't make
that contract like,

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.108
I will pay you $3.50 per bushel
on September 1 in Ethereum,

00:55:19.108 --> 00:55:21.400
because you're making a
statement about the real world.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.180
The Ethereum blockchain
cannot verify that I gave you

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:25.680
the bushels.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.388
LARRY LESSIG: OK.

00:55:26.388 --> 00:55:28.850
So I've got two slides to get
to your example [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:29.350
OK.

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:31.683
AUDIENCE: There's ways to do
it, but they're very risky,

00:55:31.683 --> 00:55:32.500
I should say.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.333
LARRY LESSIG: Right.

00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:35.320
But let's bracket it for just--

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.740
I'm not sure if it's
two, but it's n slides.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.510
But n is less than
100, I promise.

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:43.240
So just hold one second, OK?

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.000
So if you say that
one function here

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.240
is to substitute for
a failed legal system,

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:55.400
that suggests that the
other key opportunity here

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.810
is to enable contracts where the
transaction costs right now are

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:02.480
otherwise too high.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.530
So this is a key opportunity
to think of places where

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:09.400
if you can lower the transaction
costs of the contract,

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.343
you will enable a
contract which otherwise

00:56:11.343 --> 00:56:12.260
can't exist right now.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:18.040
So I'm on a scientific board
for an insurance company.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.830
So I was meeting the
president last week.

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:24.057
And he was all excited
about a new product which

00:56:24.057 --> 00:56:26.140
they were investing in,
which was going to provide

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.390
flight delay insurance.

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.770
And this product was going to
be completely blockchain driven.

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:35.410
And this is what I'm trying
to get to your point.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:40.420
It would trigger payments in a
completely automatic way based

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.220
on the information
that's being reported

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.650
from the n different sites
that are reporting information

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.233
about flights.

00:56:45.233 --> 00:56:47.020
So I buy the contract.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.330
It says, if my flight is
delayed more than an hour,

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.250
I get paid $200.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.910
And automatically,
as he put it, it's

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:56.980
a no-touch product,
by which he meant

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.740
no human needs to touch this
product for this contract

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.185
to be enabled.

00:57:01.185 --> 00:57:02.560
It's a kind of
product that never

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.530
would have been available
before, because the transaction

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:07.742
costs of engaging it
were way too high.

00:57:07.742 --> 00:57:09.700
But now that we've lowered
the transaction cost

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.800
and have an infrastructure
of trust, which

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.590
is what the blockchain
is providing here,

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:17.650
there's a huge
market that now is

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.350
available for a contract
that otherwise just

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.580
wasn't there before.

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.190
Now, that market depends on
making a couple assumptions.

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.552
You're not saying that
there's 100% certainty

00:57:27.552 --> 00:57:29.260
that everything in
that market is working

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.130
the way it's supposed to work.

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:34.370
But the point is you
don't need 100% certainty

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:37.170
for the vast majority of
these kinds of contracts.

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:39.470
If it gets it wrong
every once in a while,

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:41.390
that's good enough
for government work

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.310
or good enough
for airplane work.

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:46.520
And so that's going to
be sufficient to enable

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:50.270
the market, recognizing that
even in the legal system

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:51.390
market, guess what?

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.170
It doesn't always
get it right either.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.860
But it doesn't always enforce
the contract well either.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.030
In fact, the costs
are much, much higher

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:00.650
to fail in the legal system.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:01.340
OK.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.440
So two kinds of
transaction costs.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.950
One system transaction
cost suggests

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:10.310
that where you have less
developed legal systems,

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:12.770
the blockchain is going to
provide a real opportunity,

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:15.260
because you're going to
lower the transaction

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.730
costs for those systems.

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:19.390
And the other is just
contract transaction costs.

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:22.280
There'll be a huge
explosion of markets where,

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.060
right now, the contract
transaction costs are so high,

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.183
and we can lower them
and thereby enable

00:58:28.183 --> 00:58:29.600
a certain kind of
transaction that

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.740
otherwise wouldn't be there.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.240
OK.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.750
Final point I want to make.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:36.250
The other thing technologists
always love to say

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.910
is the great thing
we will do when

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:42.100
we do contract
technology is they'll

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.860
solve the clarity problem.

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.097
Every term will be
perfectly clear.

00:58:47.097 --> 00:58:48.680
Because you write
those contracts out,

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.070
and there's all sorts of
ambiguity and vagueness,

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.060
and it's a total mess.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.500
But when we've coded
all of our contracts,

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.060
our smart contracts,
then we'll have

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.490
perfect certainty for
every single outcome,

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.987
and that will be great.

00:59:02.987 --> 00:59:04.570
And the point I want
to suggest to you

00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:10.800
is that, often, obscurity
is a real value.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.700
Obscurity is what you want,
because here's a way to see it.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.210
So imagine this is
a decision tree.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:17.430
And it's really
small, because I just

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:18.420
stole it from the internet.

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.920
And it doesn't have anything
to do really with what

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.878
I'm talking about here.

00:59:20.878 --> 00:59:23.760
But imagine a really
complicated decision tree

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.850
like this, which is to represent
all the possible things that

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:28.950
could happen with our deal.

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:30.240
So I want to buy the house.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.060
But what happens if the
house gets hit by a meteor?

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:35.040
Or what happens if
you go bankrupt?

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.980
All of these possible outcomes.

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.950
And in principle, we could
say we should be negotiating

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:42.217
every one of these blue dots.

00:59:42.217 --> 00:59:44.300
We should be saying, what
happens if this happens?

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.230
OK, then this is what you
get, and this is what I get.

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:47.130
What happens if that happens?

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:47.960
What you get, what I get.

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.460
OK.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.730
So imagine this
blue dot here has

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:55.260
a 0.002% chance of happening.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.870
So you know the chance of that
happening is practically zero.

00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:02.620
And so what's the
reasonable amount of time

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:06.420
you should spend
negotiating that term?

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.320
Zero, right?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.840
Especially because if
this term is something

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.775
you know he's really
worked up about

01:00:14.775 --> 01:00:17.150
and you could never come to
an agreement about that term,

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:19.660
it would be ridiculous that
the whole contract fall apart

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.440
because of this
0.002% possibility.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.650
So what contracts
do all the time

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.990
is they create
these fuzzy or vague

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:32.950
or ambiguous places as a gamble.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:35.210
It's like, OK, we'll go forward.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:39.730
We're going to just gamble
that this 0.002% outcome won't

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.740
happen.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.950
Most of the time, in fact,
you can work out how often

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.475
it doesn't happen, right?

01:00:46.475 --> 01:00:48.350
So most of the time,
that would be just fine.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:52.360
And if it turns out to
happen, then what we'll do

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.090
is ask somebody--

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:59.420
namely, a judge-- to
figure that term out.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.050
We'll say, what should that
term be interpreted as?

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.240
It was ambiguous, so what
should the answer be?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.490
And the judge will look at it.

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:08.730
And judge will say, well, it's
fair that you win or he wins.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.460
So the point is
there are many times

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.002
when you ask the
question, should you

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.750
negotiate a term ex ante?

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:17.760
And the answer to
that question is no.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.640
And in those
contexts, an ambiguity

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.230
is a way to negotiate it ex
post, meaning after the fact,

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:27.790
ex post, by using the court.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:31.710
So as we think about these
digital smart contracts,

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:35.120
this is why smart contracts are
referred to as dumb contracts.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.100
They're smart contracts
for the equivalent

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.110
of dropping a dime
in and getting a Dr.

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:43.250
Pepper, the sorts of things
where the possibilities are

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:48.230
really small and narrow, or,
like my CEO was really excited,

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:49.670
is your plane late?

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.230
Yes, I get $50.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:52.610
No, I don't.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.480
Things where it's
relatively clear.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.360
But there's a really
important conceptual question

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.860
about what happens
when we're trying

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:05.510
to use them for the kinds of
contracts where what we want

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:07.190
is ambiguity.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:14.000
Because if the very terms of
deployment of the platform

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.573
demand specifying all of the
outcomes in this tree, then

01:02:20.573 --> 01:02:22.490
your basic thing is a
whole bunch of contracts

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.980
you're just not going to be
able to have in this space,

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:29.570
because the cost of specifying
that tree will be higher

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:31.500
than the benefit
of those contracts.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.670
So it's a weird sense in
which, on the one hand,

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:37.700
I've said to you that
this technology can

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.610
lower the transaction
costs of contracts.

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.550
But for this kind
of contract, it

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:47.710
can actually increase the
transaction costs of contract.

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:49.700
Because for this
kind of contract,

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:54.010
if it reveals the ambiguities
we need to negotiate about

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.990
and those negotiating
ambiguities are just

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:57.940
too costly for us
to negotiate, then

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.160
it's going to block us
from having that contract.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.010
It forces us to see the
0.002%, and you and I

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.660
have to come to terms on it.

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:09.480
And we don't yet have a
good way to fake ambiguity.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.880
I mean, the legal
system fakes ambiguity,

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.370
because we just say, oh, yeah,
yeah, we didn't see that.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:15.590
They saw it.

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.640
He knew it when they
wrote the contract.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.690
But they don't have
to admit they knew it.

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:25.110
But the code has to admit it
knows there's an ambiguity.

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.400
And that's a hard thing to
self consciously prevent.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:27.900
OK.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.330
So I've given you four ideas.

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:31.275
Happy to take
questions or abuse.

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.400
Usually, I get abuse from
business school students,

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.770
but OK.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:40.530
AUDIENCE: So what if you can
code into a contract the easy

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:43.497
scenarios and then say else-if--

01:03:43.497 --> 01:03:44.580
LARRY LESSIG: Go to court.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.820
AUDIENCE: --go to court or
some multinational court

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:50.598
that is the Ethereum
court or whatever.

01:03:50.598 --> 01:03:51.390
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:56.130
And even the Ethereum court will
have to have a court above it

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:58.760
if it wants to avoid government
saying, if you have anything

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.010
to do with Ethereum, we're
going to punish you, right?

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:03.093
So this is the sense of
which I wanted to suggest,

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:05.670
to go back to your
first question,

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:10.170
that if you think about it as
layers of an onion, peel layers

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:12.420
back enough, and you're
going to, in the end,

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:17.650
have to get to a state
in some sense, a state

01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:19.860
as an enforceable mechanism.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.500
And that enforceable
mechanism doesn't

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.030
have to be for every case.

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:26.190
Again, 99% of the time,
you drop the dime in,

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.690
you get the Dr. Pepper.

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.740
But there's a contingency where
you drop the dime in, and out

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.220
comes a bottle of gasoline.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.053
And then you need to
go to somebody and say,

01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:35.280
you breached this contract.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.300
And that person--

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.390
AUDIENCE: But if it's a contract
between somebody in Alaska

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:41.190
and somebody in
Rwanda, you still

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:42.490
have the question of
which state you go to.

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:43.400
What's the jurisdiction?

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.942
So I feel like there
would have to be

01:04:44.942 --> 01:04:48.078
some extranational extra-state.

01:04:48.078 --> 01:04:48.870
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:51.090
So you will see in
these types of contracts

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:54.180
is there'll be a whole bunch
of boilerplate that specifies

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.940
choice of law, which turns out
to be a relatively easy thing

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.720
to do right now, choice
of jurisdictions.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.310
For most countries,
it's pretty easy.

01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:02.768
There are standard
ways to do that.

01:05:02.768 --> 01:05:04.770
All of that will plug
in automatically.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.710
But again, all of those
are outside of the code.

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:10.550
All of those are law.

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:11.940
AUDIENCE: Comment
and a question.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:18.340
So I don't trust Vatalik
or other software engineers

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.020
that they have the legal
understanding and capacity

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.660
to write legally
binding contracts.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.610
So I trust the government
or I trust the court.

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:31.500
I don't trust a
software engineer

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.850
to write a proper code to
protect me or my counterparty.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:43.030
So what is your take on
those smart contracts?

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:45.210
PROFESSOR: Can I add to that?

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.630
Not only your take on
whether to trust but what

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:54.000
the courts in Europe and the US
right now do if somebody says,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.728
I wrote the contract,
and here's the code.

01:05:56.728 --> 01:05:58.770
LARRY LESSIG: Well, so
when you say-- let me just

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:01.930
me understand the
question better.

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:02.430
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:03.635
Your name is--

01:06:03.635 --> 01:06:04.260
AUDIENCE: Hugo.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.052
LARRY LESSIG: Hugo.

01:06:05.052 --> 01:06:06.590
The way Hugo
described it, I think,

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:10.410
is nice, with a whole bunch of
conditional statements, which

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:11.280
is the code.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.890
So the code says,
if the plane leaves

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:19.560
more than 30 minutes late, then
transfer $100 to his account.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.840
So you don't trust
Vatalik's system

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.840
to be able to implement
that conditional?

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.800
AUDIENCE: Yep.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.220
I don't understand-- I
mean, I don't know the code.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.260
I don't know if it's breakable.

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.898
I don't know if Jean can
log in and change it.

01:06:33.898 --> 01:06:35.190
LARRY LESSIG: I'm sure she can.

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:39.540
But the point is,
for most people,

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.550
this is true of everything.

01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:43.110
When I say to you,
I'm a lawyer, I'm

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:47.130
going to write the contract so
you can sell your car to Andy,

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:48.817
you can have the same questions.

01:06:48.817 --> 01:06:50.400
You can have the
question whether Andy

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.070
is going to have a way to
flip the price so instead

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:56.340
of $10,000, it's 15,000.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.990
So this uncertainty
is everywhere.

01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:00.510
It might be Vatalik
would say, actually,

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.500
there's a more robust
way to verify my code

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.772
than Lessig's contract code.

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:08.980
Because Lessig's contract
code is written in English,

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.230
and we have all sorts of--

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:12.390
but my code, you can
have independent people

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:13.230
who verify it.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:18.090
So at the level of conditionals,
I'm pretty confident.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:20.290
What I'm not
confident about is--

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:26.550
and I had the great pleasure
in December of 2015 spending

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:29.610
a weekend with them,
watching that group.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.830
And it's this weird kind of--

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:35.040
he is like the messiah
figure, and there's

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.890
12 people sitting on the
floor around him listening

01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.150
to his every bit of wisdom.

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.690
So it was inspirational
and scary at the same time,

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:44.400
because you see how
much money is resting

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.870
on this messiah's structure.

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:48.332
But I have a lot of
confidence in their ability

01:07:48.332 --> 01:07:49.290
to do the conditionals.

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:51.390
But I'm not so
confident that they yet

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:55.200
thought through how it plugs
into the bigger legal story.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.450
And that's part of what I
was trying to pitch to them,

01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:58.440
that's what I'm trying--

01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.857
to him, and that's
what I'm trying

01:07:59.857 --> 01:08:02.926
to pitch to you, that it's
never going to be the case.

01:08:02.926 --> 01:08:05.640
I was at this conference in
Australia where I met them.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.140
And so many of the people there
were speaking the way people

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.723
spoke about the
internet 20 years ago.

01:08:09.723 --> 01:08:12.250
It's like, oh, there's
the real world.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.545
We have governments.

01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:14.670
But we're going to create--

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:15.970
like John Perry Barlow speak.

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:18.106
We're going to create
this virtual world where

01:08:18.106 --> 01:08:19.689
there is no governments,
where we just

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:21.040
live free of government.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:26.200
And it's so fucking naive
about the way this stuff works,

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.470
because it's always embedded
in a real world which

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:30.687
has a real government.

01:08:30.687 --> 01:08:32.229
And that real
government is not going

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:35.260
to look the other way if
you're doing lots of damage

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.620
or not paying your taxes.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.500
So the question isn't whether.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.936
The question is just
how and how much.

01:08:40.936 --> 01:08:42.269
PROFESSOR: Can we go back there?

01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.894
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:42.894 --> 01:08:46.360
So I have a question about,
what kind of implications

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.470
do you think this technology
has to broaden access

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:53.649
to legal services in general,
like letting people know when

01:08:53.649 --> 01:08:56.304
they're being taken advantage
or being able to provide more

01:08:56.304 --> 01:08:58.179
standard versions of
really common contracts,

01:08:58.179 --> 01:09:00.734
like employment contracts
or lease contacts

01:09:00.734 --> 01:09:01.609
and things like that?

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:04.609
Do you think that this is going
to be a game changer for those?

01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:06.340
LARRY LESSIG: Absolutely.

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.359
I mean, you've got to
muster the political will

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.770
to break the monopoly
lawyers have in this space.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:16.359
And I'll tell you, we're going
to fight hard against it.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:20.260
But there is no reason
for 90% of what lawyers

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:23.080
do to be done by lawyers.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.050
Just like if you
buy a house and you

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:27.550
have to have a
lawyer who sits there

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:29.520
and basically signs
documents for you.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.689
You're like, why?

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:33.228
And the answer is
because the law

01:09:33.228 --> 01:09:35.770
has been written to require that
person to sit there and sign

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.279
documents.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:36.700
And why?

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.742
Because the people who
get paid to sign documents

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:40.680
have corrupted the law.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.370
So there's lots to clean up.

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.760
But if we can clean
it up, absolutely.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.439
99% of this stuff
ought to be automatic.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.770
And then let's get the lawyers
to focus on the hard corner

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.475
cases, not on everything
that should be automatic.

01:09:54.475 --> 01:09:55.850
And that certainly
should be true

01:09:55.850 --> 01:10:00.060
not just within a jurisdiction
but across jurisdiction.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.640
AUDIENCE: Can I return to
your insurance examples?

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.270
I got the idea that you could
write a smart contract that

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:11.140
would pay you automatically
if the plane was late.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.600
But then you said it
puts it on a blockchain.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.380
Can you connect why he put it
on the blockchain as opposed

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.460
to just putting it on
his disc and letting

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.990
your credit card get credited?

01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:25.870
I mean, where did the
blockchain enter into that?

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:27.790
And why did he need
a blockchain in order

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:31.233
to maintain that statement?

01:10:31.233 --> 01:10:33.400
LARRY LESSIG: I think that
the thing that he thought

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.900
he was getting out
of the blockchain

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.130
is to increase the
verifiability of third parties

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.750
of the actual payments
according to the data.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:44.380
So if I say to you, I'm
going to be paying you

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.230
$500 if your plane
is an hour late

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:51.610
and we have the data out there
about the planes being late,

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:54.040
if he did it inside of
his insurance company,

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.140
I wouldn't have any way
to know that he paid you

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.060
$500 for the plane being late.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.880
But if it's in a blockchain,
there's at least conceptually

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.770
a way in which we
could be doing this--

01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:04.300
not that I'm
reviewing it to you,

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.060
but we could be signaling--

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.310
AUDIENCE: That doesn't follow.

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:09.670
So that depends on who
maintains the blockchain.

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:12.220
And then at the same
time, it returns that.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.290
Suddenly, everybody
knows the cash flow

01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:16.480
of that insurance
company, which is likely

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.810
not something he wants to do.

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:20.310
LARRY LESSIG: Well, the cash
flow of the insurance company's

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.020
bigger than authenticating
the truth about certain types

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:23.660
of contracts.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.160
AUDIENCE: Well, let
us know the cash flow

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.550
of that part of the business.

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:28.780
So I mean, he may not want that.

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:33.730
I may not want everybody to
know what planes I'm flying.

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:35.320
So you've implied
that there's now

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.610
a public blockchain that does
that to everyone to verify.

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.820
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.290
All I mean to argue--

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:43.700
and I didn't
interrogate him far.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.700
I was just taking his
statement that he's doing.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.825
So I'm trying to think,
why would he want to do it?

01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:50.440
Because I had the same kind
of question you wanted to.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.580
And it's just that if you are
trying to create credibility

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.700
around your claim--

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.180
but do I have a reason to
trust this insurance company

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.972
that, in fact, it's
going to be doing this?

01:11:59.972 --> 01:12:02.680
Then there's some transparency
that this enables--

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.200
not necessarily the transparency
of your credit card number

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.660
or your name or the
flights that you're taking,

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.870
but that there was somebody who
was on this who had a contract,

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:13.120
and we then made
this kind of payment.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.100
That would be a potential
value that he has.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.830
Now, if there's no value
from that, then you're right.

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:20.110
The overhead of the
blockchain or public

01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:22.240
or private or
whatever is too high,

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.010
and he just could do it inside.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:26.320
And for certain
companies, like if you

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.080
went to a credible insurance
company, the credible insurance

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.880
company, you probably trust
that credible insurance company.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.110
But again, if you're a not
credible insurance company,

01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:39.020
if you're a startup and you
are out there in the market

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.610
and you're saying,
give me your money

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.050
and I'll pay you if
the plane's late,

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:44.050
people are going to say,
why should I trust you?

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:45.290
And you're like, well, here.

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:46.707
You don't really
have to trust me.

01:12:46.707 --> 01:12:48.590
Here's the data.

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:51.710
Here's the evidence in a more
credible way than if I just

01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:53.900
published a report on
my website that I'm

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.760
doing what I say I'm doing.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.983
PROFESSOR: Let's try to--

01:12:56.983 --> 01:12:59.793
AUDIENCE: He has
to escrow the $500.

01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:02.210
PROFESSOR: Andy, let's try to
get a couple more questions.

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:05.570
But my hunch is that it's
probably a permission rather

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:07.130
than permissionless blockchain.

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:09.380
And it may be the
insurance company

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.020
wants to ride on the
buzz of blockchain.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.140
But it's possible,
also, that he thinks

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.930
that there'll be more
trust, that consumers

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:21.560
will trust that if it's
called a blockchain.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.150
But you did an interview.

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:24.580
You can pick who you want to--

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.710
LARRY LESSIG: Right here.

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:27.127
AUDIENCE: So proof
of performance,

01:13:27.127 --> 01:13:30.420
could this whole smart
contract solve it?

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.350
So for instance, some
countries will receive--

01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:38.960
and I was talking to
Leonardo about it in Cargill,

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.610
in his company.

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.950
They deliver wheat
to some countries.

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:46.340
And proof of performance
is always delayed.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.030
And hence, it becomes
a private issue.

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:53.288
So could smart contracts
solve something like that?

01:13:53.288 --> 01:13:54.080
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.820
If you had an alternative way
to credibly represent a fact--

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.540
and again, this is kind of
connected to Andy's point.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:04.100
Is there an alternative way?

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.910
And is this the alternative way?

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.640
Then you lower the transaction
cost of that kind of contract,

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.560
because I'm going to trust
the contracting process more

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.750
if I'm confident that, in fact,
the fact that I'm not late

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:22.250
doesn't penalize
me, or you don't

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.750
penalize me claiming I'm late.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:26.870
So to the extent you lower
the cost of verifying

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:29.750
facts in the world, you
increase the opportunity

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:33.230
for certain contracts to happen
who otherwise wouldn't happen.

01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:35.360
And that's the only
trade-off that I'm

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.550
trying to emphasize by
emphasizing the transaction

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.510
cost part of these contracts.

01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:42.820
You had a question here?

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.368
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

01:14:44.368 --> 01:14:46.660
I was just saying maybe one
of the benefits of applying

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:51.175
blockchain here would be
not for one-off transactions

01:14:51.175 --> 01:14:52.800
but for the insurance
company, perhaps,

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.537
to have an aggregate
thousands of transactions

01:14:55.537 --> 01:14:56.870
where they've shown performance.

01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:00.070
And they can use this
for commercial reasons

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:02.330
to show that, yes,
people get paid

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:05.570
when they purchase our
insurance and get credibility

01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:08.938
for particular products.

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:09.730
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:11.540
You would frame that
as it would have

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.880
to be that that would be
a value it was providing.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.350
Otherwise, to
Andy's point, there

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:18.307
would be no reason
to adopt this.

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:18.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:21.017
Go on the back right.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.100
I don't remember your name

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.200
AUDIENCE: Kyle.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:31.190
So with, I guess, easier access
to these derivative contracts,

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:33.920
do you foresee a
world where there's

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.992
a lot more leverage
in any type of market

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:39.200
outside of financial markets?

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.152
And do you foresee this creating
kind of a risk in that way?

01:15:43.152 --> 01:15:46.280
LARRY LESSIG: Well, I mean,
this is your expertise, right?

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.070
Because, I mean, we already
saw in the derivatives market

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:51.890
the fact that the
choice by policymakers

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:54.560
was to allow it to be
an invisible market

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.150
and not to regulate that market.

01:15:56.150 --> 01:16:00.487
It created all sorts of risks
that sensible people might

01:16:00.487 --> 01:16:01.820
think shouldn't have been there.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.195
And I think the
same potential is

01:16:03.195 --> 01:16:05.480
here, which is, again, to
come back to the point,

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.680
don't expect there not
to be government here.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.910
I mean, to the extent
people realize this risk

01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:13.850
and don't have as much
political corrupting power

01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:15.880
as Wall Street
did in our system,

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.630
we should expect
governments [INAUDIBLE]..

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.640
PROFESSOR: I would say yes.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.300
Even on bitcoin, you can create
something called discrete log

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:28.460
contracts to do contracts for
differences or derivatives.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.280
But with smart contracts,
you can put a lot of leverage

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.880
into the system.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.770
And transactions
can move quickly.

01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:39.770
So I think the state will
have an interest, particularly

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:41.120
if it grows.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.370
We probably only have time
for two more questions.

01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:46.490
And I'm still wondering,
how do courts currently look

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:50.670
at these as a matter of law?

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:53.820
In the late 1990s, I
was honored to work

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:56.190
with Senator John McCain
on something which

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:58.622
became the e-signature law.

01:16:58.622 --> 01:17:01.080
I was just playing point for
the US Department of Treasury.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.160
It was really John McCain's
law Congress was doing.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.900
But I'm wondering
how the courts today

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.720
would see these contracts.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.840
Do we need something
like an e-signature law

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.642
to have code accepted beyond
what e-signature accepted?

01:17:18.642 --> 01:17:19.350
LARRY LESSIG: No.

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:22.170
I think the e-signature
infrastructure

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.487
is going to be 99% of
what this system is.

01:17:24.487 --> 01:17:26.820
PROFESSOR: You mean that which
I worked on 20 years ago?

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:26.912
LARRY LESSIG: Yeah.

01:17:26.912 --> 01:17:28.410
You solved 99% of the problem.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:29.618
PROFESSOR: Little did I know.

01:17:29.618 --> 01:17:30.640
LARRY LESSIG: Here, too.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.140
Yeah.

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.140
I mean, that's why I
wanted to wrap this

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.840
around the idea of a
soda pop machine, right?

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.610
So it's nothing
new, in some sense.

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:41.610
Contract law has always
dealt with machines that

01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:44.290
are delivering on obligations.

01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:45.960
It's just a more
sophisticated set

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.540
of proofs you're going to
have to make in a court.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:52.410
But it's the same
underlying plot.

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:55.700
PROFESSOR: One more question.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.280
We're MIT.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.870
We're supposed to end
five minutes early.

01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:58.260
LARRY LESSIG: Oh, OK.

01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.160
PROFESSOR: I don't know
what you do at Harvard.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.450
LARRY LESSIG: I don't remember.

01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:03.180
PROFESSOR: It's Harvard Law.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.500
LARRY LESSIG: Right here.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.460
AUDIENCE: So I have a little
bit of the opposite question

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.660
from Elon, which is a lot of the
contracts you're talking about,

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:14.220
simple contracts, right?

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.200
You've got individuals
on one side.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.620
You've got large companies,
like your insurance company,

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.570
on the other.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.610
The insurance company
can't, in fact,

01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:24.210
go through the
entire decision tree

01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:28.150
and decide what every
term is in their favor.

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:30.530
And the law deals with
that all the time.

01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:33.230
But here, you have another
problem, which is now,

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.410
it's going to be OK.

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.770
It's going to be written
in computer code.

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:39.140
How are the judges
going to deal with that?

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.630
Now it's a language
that is going

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.300
to be even tougher to
deal with that problem.

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.930
LARRY LESSIG: Great question.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.282
And the answer is--

01:18:47.282 --> 01:18:49.490
so this is actually another
version of your question.

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:51.890
The answer to that is
nobody knows right now.

01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:55.250
And so this issue gets raised
in a lot of parallel contexts.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.390
For example, there's a Supreme
Court Justice from California

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:04.880
who's doing a lot of work about
the question of black boxes

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.495
that predict whether you are
likely to commit a crime again.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.370
So if you're convicted
of crime, the question

01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:12.995
is whether you're
going to have parole.

01:19:12.995 --> 01:19:15.840
The parole process is supposed
to decide your likelihood

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.520
of committing a crime.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.010
So these companies have
built these black boxes where

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.690
you spit in every bit of data.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.060
And it comes out and says
yes, you're a criminal,

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.553
or no, you're not.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.970
And then the lawyers
come forward,

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:29.640
and they say, well, I want
to interrogate the black box.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.040
I want to know what--

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.773
And the courts are completely
confused about this.

01:19:33.773 --> 01:19:35.190
Because on the one
hand, they say,

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:37.725
no, no, this is
their trade secret.

01:19:37.725 --> 01:19:39.850
But on the other hand,
they're like, wait a minute.

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:41.830
You can't decide whether
I have liberty or not

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:45.048
based on these black boxes that
just spit out numbers, right?

01:19:45.048 --> 01:19:46.840
So I've got to be able
to interrogate them.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.710
Right.

01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:51.100
So this is the most
important innovation that's

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.600
got to happen in the law.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.270
Lawyers have to
become technically

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:59.140
sophisticated to be
able to read code

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.630
like they read legal contracts.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.210
They have to have a conceptual
understanding of what

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:07.990
code can do so they can
think creatively about code

01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:10.960
like they think creatively
about language, right?

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.900
And one of the most
important innovations

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.710
that we, like the Berkman
Center and people like that,

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:19.870
are trying to push into
the legal environment

01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:23.680
is to insist that just
like lawyers now all study

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.280
economics, because that's a core
way of thinking about the law,

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.480
we also should study
basic code so we

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.910
can think about this
modality of regulation.

01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:36.070
Not expect people are
going to be writing code,

01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:38.230
but at least that they
can think through it.

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:39.280
So I completely agree.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.750
That's a fudge space that
I didn't talk about at all.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.310
But I think it's a really
important problem, thinking

01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:46.540
about whether the
legal system is going

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.665
to be able to deal with it.

01:20:47.665 --> 01:20:51.340
Because if none of the
lawyers understand it, yeah.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.090
Let me just end with
one story about that.

01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:55.990
So when I first started
doing this work, talking

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:58.150
about code and--

01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:01.620
I went to Paris 20 years
ago, and I gave a speech

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.650
to some lawyer group.

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:04.810
And I sat down after the speech.

01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:09.160
And the chairman of this legal
group sat down next to me.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.210
And I introduced myself.

01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:12.040
And he stood up, and
he grabbed my card.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.580
And he crushed it.

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.430
And he threw it to the ground.

01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:18.650
And he said, I am
not a technician.

01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:20.750
And his point was
he, as a lawyer,

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:25.310
could never accept the idea that
what he needed to understand

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:27.150
was code.

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:28.680
That was forbidden.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.530
It was beneath him.

01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:34.950
And I think it's a hugely
important cultural problem

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:37.160
to integrate this
form of knowledge.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.650
Because if we don't, then the
problem you're talking about

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:42.080
is really a huge problem.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.130
But I think we can, because
we've seen lots of--

01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:46.100
PROFESSOR: So I
want to thank you

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.030
on behalf of the class,
Blockchain and Money.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:53.404
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:55.340 --> 01:22:00.230
I also want to say you're much
better than Christopher Lloyd.

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.360
And if anybody wants
to know the joke,

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.640
watch that West Wing episode
that Christopher Lloyd plays

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.960
Professor Lawrence Lessig.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.000
So thank you.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.030
See you on Thursday.

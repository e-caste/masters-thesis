00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.620
PROFESSOR: Last time,
we talked about the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.600
representation of linear
time-invariant systems through

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.400
the convolution sum in the
discrete-time case and the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.120
convolution integral in the
continuous-time case.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.520
Now, although the derivation
was relatively

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.970
straightforward, in fact, the
result is really kind of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.250
amazing because what it tells
us is that for linear

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.580
time-invariant systems, if we
know the response of the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.540
system to a single impulse at
t = 0, or in fact, at any

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.710
other time, then we can
determine from that its

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.590
response to an arbitrary input
through the use of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.900
convolution.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.650
Furthermore, what we'll see as
the course develops is that,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.660
in fact, the class of linear
time-invariant systems is a

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.720
very rich class.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.770
There are lots of systems
that have that property.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.650
And in addition, there are
lots of very interesting

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.280
things that you can do with
linear time-invariant systems.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.510
In today's lecture, what I'd
like to begin with is focusing

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.730
on convolution as an algebraic
operation.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.370
And we'll see that it has a
number of algebraic properties

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.150
that in turn have important
implications for linear

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.120
time-invariant systems.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.009
Then we'll turn to a discussion
of what the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.680
characterization of linear
time-invariant systems through

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
convolution implies, in terms
of the relationship, of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.110
various other system properties

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.240
to the impulse response.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.220
Let me begin by reminding you
of the basic result that we

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.180
developed last time, which
is the convolution sum in

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.740
discrete time, as I indicate
here, and the convolution

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.820
integral in continuous time.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.850
And what the convolution sum,
or the convolution integral,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.850
tells us is how to relate the
output to the input and to the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.940
system impulse response.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.750
And the expression looks
basically the same in

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.320
continuous time and
discrete time.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.650
And I remind you also that we
talked about a graphical

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.940
interpretation, where
essentially, to graphically

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.760
interpret convolution required,
or was developed, in

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.160
terms of taking the system
impulse response, flipping it,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.460
sliding it past the input, and
positioned appropriately,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.500
depending on the value of the
independent variable for which

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.340
we're computing the convolution,
and then

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.230
multiplying and summing in the
discrete-time case, or

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.390
integrating in the
continuous-time case.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.070
Now convolution, as an algebraic
operation, has a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.000
number of important
properties.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.370
One of the properties of
convolution is that it is what

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.300
is referred to as commutative.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.330
Commutative means that we can
think either of convolving x

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.760
with h, or h with x, and the
order in which that's done

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.590
doesn't affect the
output result.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.649
So summarized here is what the
commutative operation is in

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.990
discrete time, or in
continuous time.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.050
And it says, as I just
indicated, that x[n]

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.240
convolved with h[n]

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.500
is equal to h[n]

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.750
convolved with x[n].

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.930
Or the same, of course,
in continuous time.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.200
And in fact, in the lecture
last time, we worked an

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.000
example where we had, in
discrete time, an impulse

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.980
response, which was an
exponential, and an input,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.760
which is a unit step.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.520
And in the text, what you'll
find is the same example

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.110
worked, except in that case, the
input is the exponential.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.370
And the system impulse
response is the step.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.380
And that corresponds to the
example in the text, which is

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.720
example 3.1.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.130
And what happens in that example
is that, in fact, what

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.850
you'll see is that the same
result occurs in example 3.1

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.400
as we generated in
the lecture.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.090
And there's a similar comparison
in continuous time.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.680
This example was worked
in lecture.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.740
And this example is worked
in the text.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.370
In other words, the text works
the example where the system

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.960
impulse response
is a unit step.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.130
And the input is
an exponential.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.220
All right, now the commutative
property, as I said, tells us

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.700
that the order in which we do
convolution doesn't affect the

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.710
result of the convolution.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.560
The same is true for
continuous time

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.940
and discrete time.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.830
And in fact, for the other
algebraic properties that I'll

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.310
talk about, the results are
exactly the same for

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.040
continuous time and
discrete time.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.210
So in fact, what we can do is
drop the independent variable

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.720
as an argument so that we
suppress any kind of

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.820
difference between continuous
and discrete time.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.220
And suppressing the independent
variable, we then

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.170
state the commutative property
as I've rewritten it here.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.970
Just x convolved with h equals
h convolved with x.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.360
The same in continuous time
and discrete time.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.950
Now, the derivation of the
commutative property is, more

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.900
or less, some algebra
which you can follow

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.960
through in the book.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.810
It involves some changes
of variables and some

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.310
things of that sort.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.440
What I'd like to focus on with
that and other properties is

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.520
not the derivation, which you
can see in the text, but

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.760
rather the interpretation.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.050
So we have the commutative
property, and now there are

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.090
two other important algebraic
properties.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.760
One being what is referred to
as the associative property,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.590
which tells us that if we have x
convolved with the result of

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.570
convolving h1 with h2, that's
exactly the same as x

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.890
convolved with h1, and that
result convolved with h2.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:49.590
And what this permits is for
us to write, for example, x

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:56.470
convolved with h1 convolved with
h2 without any ambiguity

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.750
because it doesn't matter from
the associative property how

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.470
we group the terms together.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.950
The third important property is
what is referred to as the

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.670
distributive property, namely
the fact that convolution

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.520
distributes over addition.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.560
And what I mean by that is what
I've indicated here on

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:24.650
the slide: that if I think of x
convolved with the sum of h1

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:31.380
and h2, that's identical to
first convolving x with h1,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.140
also convolving x with h2, and
then adding the two together.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.960
And that result will be the
same as this result.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.550
So convolution is commutative,
associative, and it

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.050
distributes over addition.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.080
Three very important algebraic
properties.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.710
And by the way, there are other
algebraic operations

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.330
that have that same property.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.900
For example, multiplication
of numbers is likewise

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.000
commutative, associative,
and distributive.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.890
Now let's look at what these
three properties imply

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.170
specifically for linear
time-invariant systems.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.770
And as we'll see, the
implications are both very

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.260
interesting and very
important.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.910
Let's begin with the commutative
property.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.860
And consider, in particular,
a system with an impulse

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.630
response h.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.450
And I represent that by simply
writing the h inside the box.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:46.100
An input x and an output,
then, which is x * h.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.430
Now, since this operation is
commutative, I can write

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:55.020
instead of x * h, I
can write h * x.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.210
And that would correspond to a
system with impulse response

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:07.880
x, and input h, and
output then h * x.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.620
So the commutative property
tells us that for a linear

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:20.040
time-invariant system, the
system output is independent

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.290
of which function we call the
input and which function we

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.830
call the impulse response.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.360
Kind of amazing actually.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.090
We can interchange the role of
input and impulse response.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:36.480
And from an output point of
view, the output or the system

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.660
doesn't care.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.100
Now furthermore, if we combine
the commutative property with

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.270
the associative property,
we get another

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.130
very interesting result.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.020
Namely that if we have two
linear time-invariant systems

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.330
in cascade, the overall system
is independent of the order in

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.890
which they're cascaded.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.740
And in fact, in either case, the
cascade can be collapsed

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.660
into a single system.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:13.120
To see this, let's first
consider the cascade of two

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.140
systems, one with impulse
response h1, the other with

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.330
impulse response h2.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:25.770
And the output of the first
system is then x * h1.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.470
And then that is the input
to the second system.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:36.920
And so the output of that is
that result convolved with h2.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.500
So this is the result of
cascading the two.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.190
And now we can use the
associative property to

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:55.000
rewrite this as x * (h1
* h2), where we group

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.160
these two terms together.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.200
And so using the associative
property, we now can collapse

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.860
that into a single system with
an input, which is x, and

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.360
impulse response, which
is h1 * h2.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.040
And the output is then x
convolved with the result of

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.880
those two convolved.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.880
Next, we can apply the
commutative property.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.590
And the commutative property
says we could write this

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.970
impulse response that way, or
we could write it this way.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.200
And since convolution is
commutative, the resulting

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.100
output will be exactly
the same.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.200
And so these resulting outputs
will be exactly the same.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.560
And now, once again we can use
the associative property to

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.670
group these two terms
together.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:54.920
And x * h2 corresponds to
putting x first through the

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.270
system h2 and then that output
through the system h1.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.320
And so finally applying the
associative property again, as

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.330
I just outlined, we can expand
that system back into two

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:16.160
systems in cascade with h2
first and h1 second,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.220
OK, well that involves a certain
amount of algebraic

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.490
manipulation.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.620
And that is not the algebraic

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.140
manipulation that is important.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.250
It's the result that
it's important.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.330
And what the result says, to
reiterate, is if I have two

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.750
linear time-invariant systems in
cascade, I can cascade them

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.740
in any order, and the
result is the same.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.630
Now you might think, well gee,
maybe that actually applies to

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.710
systems in general, whether
you put them

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.020
this way or that way.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.140
But in fact, as we talked
about last time, and I

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:58.680
illustrated with an example, in
general, if the systems are

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.000
not linear and time-invariant,
then the order in which

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.490
they're cascaded is important
to the interpretation of the

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.690
overall system.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.070
For example, if one system took
the square root and the

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:16.080
other system doubled the input,
taking the square root

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.320
and then doubling gives us a
different answer than doubling

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.150
first and then taking
the square root.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.570
And of course, one can construct
much more elaborate

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.330
examples than that.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.280
So it's a property very
particular to linear

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.570
time-invariant systems.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:37.590
And also one that we will
exploit many, many times as we

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.900
go through this material.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.440
The final property related to an
interconnection of systems

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.470
that I want to just indicate
develops out of the

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.270
distributive property.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:55.320
And what it applies to is
an interpretation of the

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.020
interconnection of systems
in parallel.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.520
Recall that the parallel
combination of systems

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.030
corresponds, as I indicate here,
to a system in which we

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.900
simultaneously feed the input
into h1 and h2, these

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.680
representing the impulse
responses.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.410
And then, the outputs
are summed to

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.740
form the overall output.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.050
And using the fact that
convolution distributes over

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:37.750
addition, we can rewrite
this as x * (h1 + h2).

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.980
And when we do that then, we
can recognize this as the

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.280
output of a system with input x
and impulse response, which

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.300
is the sum of these two
impulse responses.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.240
So for linear time-invariant
systems in parallel, we can,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.600
if we choose, replace that
interconnection by a single

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.920
system whose impulse response
is simply the sum of those

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.170
impulse responses.

00:16:09.854 --> 00:16:16.460
OK, now we have this very
powerful representation for

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.530
linear time-invariant systems
in terms of convolution.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.010
And we've seen so far in this
lecture how convolution and

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.860
the representation through the
impulse response leads to some

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.570
important implications for
system interconnections.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.100
What I'd like to turn to now
are other system properties

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.400
and see how, for linear
time-invariant systems in

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:49.490
particular, other system
properties can be associated

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.500
with particular properties or
characteristics of the system

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.160
impulse response.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.130
And what we'll talk about are
a variety of properties.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.200
We'll talk about the issue of
memory, we'll talk about the

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.780
issue of invertibility, and
we'll talk about the issue of

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.004
causality and also stability.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.230
Well, let's begin with
the issue of memory.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.660
And the question now is what are
the implications for the

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.490
system impulse response for a
linear time-invariant system?

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.440
Remember that we're always
imposing that on the system.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.319
What are the implications on
the impulse response if the

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.350
system does or does
not have memory?

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.440
Well, we can answer
that by looking at

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.860
the convolution property.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.660
And we have here, as a reminder,
the convolution

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:51.230
integral, which tells us how
x(tau) and h(t - tau) are

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:56.020
combined to give us y(t).

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.940
And what I've illustrated
above is a

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.730
general kind of example.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.890
Here is x(tau).

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.670
Here is h(t - tau).

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:13.450
And to compute the output at
any time t, we would take

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:18.160
these two, multiply them
together, and integrate from

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.730
-infinity to +infinity.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.050
So the question then is what
can we say about h(t), the

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:33.020
impulse response in order to
guarantee, let's say, that the

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.090
output depends only on
the input at time t.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:43.900
Well, it's pretty much obvious
from looking at the graphs.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:51.740
If we only want the output to
depend on x(tau) at tau = t,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:59.360
then h(t - tau) better be
non-zero only at tau = t.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.990
And so the implication then is
that for the system to be

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:12.100
memoryless, what we require is
that h(t - tau) be non-zero

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.500
only at tau = t.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.960
So we want the impulse response
to be non-zero at

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.230
only one point.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.670
We want it to contribute
something after we multiply

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.490
and go through an integral.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.410
And in effect, what that says is
the only thing that it can

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.680
be and meet all those

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.400
conditions is a scaled impulse.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:39.310
So if the system is to be
memoryless, then that requires

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.020
that the impulse response
be a scaled impulse.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:49.190
Any other impulse response then,
in essence, requires

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.010
that the system have memory,
or implies that the system

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.210
have memory.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.950
So for the continuous-time case
then, memoryless would

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.760
correspond only to the impulse
response being proportional to

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.060
an impulse.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.720
And in the discrete-time case,
a similar statement, in which

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.590
case, the output is just
proportional to the input,

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.730
again either in the
continuous-time or in the

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.980
discrete-time case.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.670
All right.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.650
Now we can turn our attention
to the issue of system

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.410
invertibility.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:35.460
And recall that what is meant by
invertibility of a system,

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.690
or the inverse of a system.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.080
The inverse of a system is a
system, which when we cascade

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.360
it with the one that we're
inquiring about, the overall

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.110
cascade is the identity
system.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:53.370
In other words, the output
is equal to the input.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.980
So let's consider a system
with impulse

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.440
response h, input is x.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.480
And let's say that the impulse
response of the inverse system

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.930
is h_i, and the output is y.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:16.850
Then, the output of this system
is x * (h * h_i).

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.830
And we want this to come
out equal to x.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:28.740
And what that requires than is
that this convolution just

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:34.590
simply be equal to an impulse,
either in the discrete-time

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.270
case or in the continuous-time
case.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.380
And under those conditions
then, h_i is equal to the

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.630
inverse of h.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.760
Notationally, by the way, it's
often convenient to write

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.620
instead of h_i as the impulse
response of the inverse,

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.330
you'll find it convenient often
and more typical to

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.970
write as the inverse, instead
of h_i, h^(-1).

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.670
And we mean by that the inverse
impulse response.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.120
And one has to be careful not
to misinterpret this as the

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.610
reciprocal of h(t) or h(n).

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.260
What's meant in this notation
is the inverse system.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:33.930
Now, if h_i is the inverse of
h, is h the inverse of h_i?

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:38.710
Well, it seems like that ought
to be plausible or perhaps

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.060
make sense.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.470
The question, if you believe
that the answer is yes, is

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.300
how, in fact, do you
verify that?

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.860
And I'll leave it to you
to think about it.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.020
The answer is yes,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.320
that if h_i is the inverse
of h, then h is

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.140
the inverse of h_i.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.800
And the key to showing that is
to exploit the fact that when

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.800
we take these systems and
cascade them, we can cascade

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.050
them in either order.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.200
All right now let's turn to
another system property, the

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.760
property of stability.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:21.160
And again, we can tie that
property directly to issues

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.010
related, in particular, to the
system impulse response.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.845
Now, stability is defined as
we've chosen to define it and

00:23:30.845 --> 00:23:34.530
as I've defined it previously,
as bounded-input

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.940
bounded-output stability.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.140
In other words, for every
bounded input

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.750
is a bounded output.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.850
What you can show--

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.690
and I won't go through the
algebra here; it's gone

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.700
through in the book--

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:53.160
is that a necessary and
sufficient condition for a

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.550
linear time-invariant system
to be stable in the

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:03.800
bounded-input bounded-output
sense is that the impulse

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.360
response be what is referred
to as absolutely summable.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.410
In other words, if you take the
absolute values and sum

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.300
them over infinite limits,
that's finite.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.300
Or in the continuous-time
case, that the impulse

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.530
response is absolutely
integrable.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.450
In other words, if you take the
absolute values of h(t)

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.690
and integrate, that's finite.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.370
And under those conditions,
the system is stable.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:39.070
If those conditions are
violated, then for sure, as

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.950
you'll see in the text, the
system is unstable.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.010
So stability can also
be tied to the

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.390
system impulse response.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.130
Now, the next property that I
want to talk about is the

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.670
property of causality.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.890
And before I do, what I'd like
to do is introduce a

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.690
peripheral result that
we'll then use--

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.870
when we talked about
causality--

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.690
namely what's referred to as the
zero input response of a

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.940
linear system.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.570
The basic result, which is a
very interesting and useful

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.180
one, is that for a
linear system--

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.350
and in fact, it's whether it's
time-invariant or not, that

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.600
this applies--

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.640
if you put nothing into it,
you get nothing out of it.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:40.460
So if we have an input x(t)
which is 0 for all t, and if

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:49.040
the output of that system is
y(t), if the input is 0 for

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.440
all time, then the output
likewise is 0 for all time.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.380
That's true for continuous time,
and it's also true for

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.630
discrete time.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:10.380
And in fact, to show that
result is pretty much

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.280
straightforward.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.570
We could do it either by using
convolution, which would, of

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.780
course, be associated with
linearity and time invariance.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.960
But in fact, we can show that
property relatively easily by

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.350
simply using the fact that, for
a linear system, what we

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:35.180
know is that if we have an
input x(t) with an output

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:42.390
y(t), then if we scale the
input, then the output scales

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.940
accordingly.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:51.290
Well, we can simply choose, as
the scale factor, a = 0.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.950
And if we do that, it
says put nothing in,

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.370
you get nothing out.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.380
And what we'll see is that has
some important implications in

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.420
terms of causality.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.400
It's important, though, while
we're on it, to stress that

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.750
not every system, obviously,
has that property.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.380
That if you put nothing in,
you get nothing out.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.980
A simple example is, let's say,
a battery, let's say not

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.330
connected to anything.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.250
The output is six volts no
matter what the input is.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.970
And it of course then doesn't
have this zero response to a

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.150
zero input.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.170
It's very particular
to linear systems.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:40.640
All right, well now let's see
what this means for causality.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.500
To remind you, causality says,
in effect, that the system

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.060
can't anticipate the input.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.260
That's what, basically,
causality means.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.470
When we talked about it
previously, we defined it in a

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.100
variety of ways, one of which
was the statement that if two

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:05.130
inputs are identical up until
some time, then the outputs

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.140
must be identical up until
the same time.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.880
The reason, kind of intuitively,
is that if the

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.190
system is causal--

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.290
so it can't anticipate
the future--

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.970
it can't anticipate whether
these two identical inputs are

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.530
sometime later going to change
from each other or not.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:30.410
So causality, in general, is
simply this statement, either

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.030
continuous-time or
discrete-time.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.200
And now, so let's look
at what that means

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.400
for a linear system.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.020
For a linear system, what that
corresponds to or could be

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:51.500
translated to is a statement
that says that if x(t) is 0,

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:58.050
for t less than t_0, then
y(t) must be 0 for t

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.580
less than t_0 also.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:07.790
And so what that, in effect,
says, is that the system--

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:14.010
for a linear system to be
causal, it must have the

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:19.200
property sometimes referred to
as initial rest, meaning it

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.850
doesn't respond until there's
some input that happens.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.250
That it's initially
at rest until the

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.680
input becomes non-zero.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.050
Now, why is this true?

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:37.690
Why is this a consequence of
causality for linear systems?

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.980
Well, the reason is we know that
if we put nothing in, we

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.630
get nothing out.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.320
If we have an input that's 0 for
t less than t_0, and the

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.830
system can't anticipate whether
that input is going to

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:58.950
change from 0 or not, then the
system must generate an output

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.940
that's 0 up until that time,
following the principle that

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.360
if two inputs are identical up
until some time, the outputs

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.660
must be identical up until
the same time.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:18.750
So this basic result for linear
systems is essentially

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:24.590
a consequence of the statement
that for a linear system, zero

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:29.010
in gives us zero out.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:40.390
Now, that tells us
how to interpret

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.190
causality for linear systems.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.360
Now, let's proceed to linear
time-invariant systems.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.900
And in fact, we can carry the
point one step further.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.380
In particular, a necessary and
sufficient condition for

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.840
causality in the case of linear
time-invariant systems

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:08.570
is that the impulse response be
0, for t less than 0 in the

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:13.030
continuous-time case, or for
n less than 0 in the

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.630
discrete-time case.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.660
So for linear time-invariant
systems, causality is

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.310
equivalent to the impulse
response being 0 up until t or

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.090
n equal to 0.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:35.330
Now, to show this essentially
follows by first considering

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:42.710
why causality would imply
that this is true.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:47.790
And that follows because of the
straightforward fact that

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.910
the impulse itself is
0 for t less than 0.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:58.480
And what we saw before is that
for any linear system,

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.280
causality requires that if the
input is 0 up until some time,

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.170
the output must be 0 up
until the same time.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:11.740
And so that's showing the
result in one direction.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.775
To show the result in the other
direction, namely to

00:32:15.775 --> 00:32:20.820
show that if, in fact, the
impulse response satisfies

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.860
that condition, then the
system is causal.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.170
While I won't work through it
in detail, it essentially

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:36.830
boils down to recognizing that
in the convolution sum, or in

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.880
the convolution integral, if,
in fact, that condition is

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.950
satisfied on the impulse
response, then the upper limit

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.880
on the sum, in the
discrete-time

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.900
case, changes to n.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.370
And in the continuous-time
case, changes to t.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:33:00.940
And that, in effect, says that
values of the input only from

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.840
-infinity up to time n are
used in computing y[n].

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.770
And a similar kind
of result for the

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.140
continuous-time case y(t).

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.330
OK, so we've seen how the
impulse response, or rather

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.170
how certain system properties
in the linear time-invariant

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:28.920
case can, be converted into
various requirements on the

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.670
impulse response of a linear
time-invariant system, the

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.440
impulse response being a
complete characterization.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.390
Let's look at some particular
examples just to kind of

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.140
cement the ideas further.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.190
And let's begin with a system
that you've seen previously,

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.165
which is an accumulator.

00:33:48.165 --> 00:33:55.860
An accumulator, as you recall,
has an output y[n], which is

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:03.080
the accumulated value of the
input from -infinity up to n.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.660
Now, you've seen in the impulse
in a previous lecture,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.239
or rather in the video course
manual for a previous lecture,

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:15.429
that an accumulator is a linear
time-invariant system.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:19.760
And in fact, its impulse
response is the accumulated

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.370
values of an impulse.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:24.855
Namely, the impulse response
is equal to a step.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:34.010
So what we want to answer is,
knowing what that impulse

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.929
response is, what some
properties are of the

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.280
accumulator.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.420
And let's first ask
about memory.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.679
Well, we recognize that the
impulse response is not simply

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.300
an impulse.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.830
In fact, it's a step.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.560
And so this implies what?

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.530
Well, it implies that the
system has memory.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:06.780
Second, the impulse response
is 0 for n less than 0.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.180
That implies that the
system is causal.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:22.530
And finally, if we look at the
sum of the absolute values of

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.930
the impulse response
from -infinity to

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.380
+infinity, this is a step.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.790
If we accumulate those values
over infinite limits, then

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:35.210
that in fact comes out
to be infinite.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:40.140
And so what that implies, then,
is that the accumulator

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.490
is not stable in the
bounded-input

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.780
bounded-output sense.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.410
Now I want to turn to
some other systems.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.630
But while we're on the
accumulator, I just want to

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.900
draw your attention to the fact,
which will kind of come

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:01.350
up in a variety of ways again
later, that we can rewrite the

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.840
equation for an accumulator,
the difference equation, by

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:10.460
recognizing that we could, in
fact, write the output as the

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.540
accumulated values up to
time n - 1 and then

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.120
add on the last value.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:23.510
And in fact, if we do that, this
corresponds to y[n-1].

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.330
And so we could rewrite this
difference equation as y[n]

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.090
= y[n-1]

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.340
+ x[n].

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.630
So the output is the
previously-computed output

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.800
plus the input.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.170
Expressed that way, what that
corresponds to is what is

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.400
called a recursive difference
equation.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.980
And different equations will
be a topic of considerable

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.290
emphasis in the next lecture.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.520
Now, does an accumulator
have an inverse?

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.100
Well, the answer is,
in fact, yes.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:02.190
And let's look at what the
inverse of the accumulator is.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.290
The impulse response of the
accumulator is a step.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:11.100
To inquire about its inverse,
we inquire about whether

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.780
there's a system, which when
we cascade the accumulator

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.510
with that system, which I'm
calling its inverse, we get an

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.410
impulse out.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.800
Well, let's see.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.060
The impulse response of the
accumulator is a step.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.820
We want to put the step
into something

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.470
and get out an impulse.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:37.500
And in fact, what you recall
from the lecture in which we

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.120
introduced steps and impulses,
the impulse is, in fact, the

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.630
first difference of
the units step.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:50.210
So we have a difference equation
that describes for us

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:54.660
how the impulse is related
to the step.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.770
And so if this system does this,
the output will be that,

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.420
an impulse.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.465
And so if we think of x_2[n]

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.470
as the input and y_2[n]

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:14.410
as the output, then the
difference equation for the

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.330
inverse system is what
I've indicated here.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.200
And if we want to look at the
impulse response of that, we

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.120
can then inquire as to what
the response is with an

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.830
impulse in.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:31.290
And what develops in a
straightforward way then is

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:37.580
delta[n], which is our impulse
input, minus delta[n-1]

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.530
is equal to the impulse
response

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.730
of the inverse system.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.260
So I'll write that
as h^(-1)[n]

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.410
(h-inverse of n).

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:52.420
Now, we have then that the
accumulator has an inverse.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.420
And this is the inverse.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.910
And you can examine issues
of memory, stability,

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.430
causality, et cetera.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:05.170
What you'll find is that the
system has memory, the inverse

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:05.810
accumulator.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:09.360
It's stable, and it's causal.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.360
And it's interesting to note, by
the way, that although the

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.620
accumulator was an unstable
system, the inverse of the

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.930
accumulator is a
stable system.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:24.680
In general, if the system is
stable, its inverse does not

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.940
have to be stable
or vice versa.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.365
And the same thing
with causality.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:38.360
OK now, there are a number of
other examples, which, of

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.200
course, we could discuss.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.830
And let me just quickly point
to one example, which is a

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.640
difference equation, as
I've indicated here.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.980
And as we'll talk about in
more detail in our next

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.480
lecture, where we'll get
involved in a fairly detailed

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.360
discussion of linear
constant-coefficient

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.690
difference and differential
equations, this falls into

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.290
that category.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.960
And under the imposition of
what's referred to as initial

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:17.970
rest, which corresponds to the
response being 0 up until the

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:22.450
time that the input becomes
non-zero, the impulse response

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.410
is a^n times u[n].

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.490
And something that you'll be
asked to think about in the

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:33.490
video course manual is whether
that system has memory,

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.550
whether it's causal, and
whether it's stable.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:41.700
And likewise, for a linear
constant coefficient

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.070
differential equation, the
specific one that I've

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:50.020
indicated here, under the
assumption of initial rest,

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:54.710
the impulse response is
e^(-2t) times u(t).

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.810
And in the video course manual
again, you'll be asked to

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:02.930
examine whether the system has
memory, whether it's causal,

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:06.410
and whether it's stable.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:10.420
OK well, as I've indicated, in
the next lecture we'll return

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.270
to a much more detailed
discussion of linear

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.180
constant-coefficient
differential

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.190
and difference equations.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:22.480
Now, what I'd like to finally do
in this lecture is use the

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.410
notion of convolution in a much
different way to help us

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.030
with a problem that I
alluded to earlier.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.800
In particular, the issue of how
to deal with some of the

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.200
mathematical difficulties
associated with

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.620
impulses and steps.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.540
Now, let me begin by
illustrating kind of what the

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:49.845
problem is and an example of the
kind of paradox that you

00:41:49.845 --> 00:41:53.480
sort of run into when dealing
with impulse functions and

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.730
step functions.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.980
Let's consider, first of all,
a system, which is the

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.520
identity system.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.090
And so the output is, of course,
equal to the input.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:12.180
And again, we can talk about
that either in continuous time

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.800
or in discrete time.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.990
Well, we know that the function
that you convolve

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:23.610
with a signal to retain the
signal is an impulse.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.650
And so that means that the
impulse response of an

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.740
identity system is an impulse.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.220
Makes logical sense.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.300
Furthermore, if I take two
identity systems and cascade

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.240
them, I put in an input, get
the same thing out of the

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:40.900
first system.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.190
That goes into the
second system.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.125
Get the same thing out
of the second.

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:51.540
In other words, if I have two
identity systems in cascade,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.840
the cascade, likewise, is
an identity system.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.020
In other words, this
overall system is

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.280
also an identity system.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.610
And the implication there is
that the impulse response of

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.110
this is an impulse.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.750
The impulse response of
this is an impulse.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:16.560
And the convolution of those
two is also an impulse.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.860
So for continuous time, we
require, then, that an impulse

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.550
convolved with itself
is an impulse.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.850
And the same thing for
discrete time.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:33.280
Now, in discrete time, we don't
have any particular

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.220
problem with that.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.130
If you think about convolving
these together, it's a

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:42.850
straightforward mathematical
operation since the impulse in

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:47.300
discrete time is very
nicely defined.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.070
However, in continuous time, we
have to be somewhat careful

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.710
about the definition of the
impulse because it was the

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.870
derivative of a step.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:57.930
A step has a discontinuity.

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.190
You can't really differentiate
at a discontinuity.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:06.020
And the way that we dealt with
that was to expand out the

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.570
discontinuity so that it had
some finite time region in

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.090
which it happened.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.080
When we did that, we ended up
with a definition for the

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.200
impulse, which was the
limiting form of this

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.510
function, which is a rectangle
of width Delta, and height 1 /

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:27.120
Delta, and an area equal to 1.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:33.680
Now, if we think of convolving
this signal with itself, the

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.480
impulse being the limiting
form of this, then the

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:42.690
convolution of this with itself
is a triangle of width

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:47.290
2 Delta, height 1 /
Delta, and area 1.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:51.560
In other words, this triangular
function is this

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:59.030
approximation delta_Delta(t)
convolved with delta_Delta(t).

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:05.000
And since the limit of this
would correspond to the

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.480
impulse response of the identity
system convolved with

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:17.470
itself, the implication is that
not only should the top

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:23.600
function, this one, correspond
in its limiting form to an

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:28.130
impulse, but also this should
correspond in its limiting

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:29.990
form to an impulse.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.750
So one could wonder well,
what is an impulse?

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:34.320
Is it this one in the limit?

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.650
Or is it this one
in the limit?

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.420
Now, beyond that-- so kind of
what this suggests is that in

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.360
the limiting form, you kind of
run into a contradiction

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.920
unless you don't try to
distinguish between this

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.170
rectangle and the triangle.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:57.050
Things get even worse when you
think about what happens when

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.160
you put an impulse into
a differentiator.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.630
And a differentiator is a very
commonly occurring system.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.350
In particular, suppose we had a
system for which the output

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.010
was the derivative
of the input.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:17.500
So if we put in x(t), we
got out dx(t) / dt.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.360
If I put in an impulse, or if
I talked about the impulse

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.130
response, what is that?

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.610
And of course, the problem is
that if you think that the

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:31.880
impulse itself is very badly
behaved, then what about its

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.110
derivative, which is not only
infinitely big, but there's a

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:38.350
positive-going one, and a
negative-going one, and the

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.440
difference between there
has some area.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.910
And you end up in a
lot of difficulty.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:51.250
Well, the way around this,
formally, is through a set of

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:56.140
mathematics referred to as
generalized functions.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.110
We won't be quite that formal.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.340
But I'd like to, at least,
suggest what the essence of

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.530
that formality is.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:07.360
And it really helps us in
interpreting the impulses in

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.620
steps and functions
of that type.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.660
And what it is is an operational
definition of

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.560
steps, impulses, and their
derivatives in

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.360
the following sense.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.600
Usually when we talk about a
function, we talk about what

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.910
the value of the function is
at any instant of time.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.810
And of course, the trouble
with an impulse is it's

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.930
infinitely big, in zero width,
and has some area, et cetera.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:35.310
What we can turn to is what is
referred to as an operational

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:41.550
definition where the operational
definition is

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:45.790
related not to what the impulse
is, but to what the

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:50.760
impulse does under the operation
of convolution.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.540
So what is an impulse?

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.110
An impulse is something,
which under

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.460
convolution, retains the function.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:04.200
And that then can serve as a
definition of the impulse.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.410
Well, let's see where
that gets us.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:11.060
Suppose that we now want to talk
about the derivative of

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.370
the impulse.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:18.970
Well, what we ask about is
what it is operationally.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:25.510
And so if we have a system,
which is a differentiator, and

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.600
we inquire about its impulse
response, which let's say we

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.630
define notationally as u_1(t).

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.650
What's important about this
function u_1(t) is not what it

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:42.620
is at each value of time
but what it does under

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.840
convolution.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.690
What does it do under
convolution?

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:49.610
Well, the output of the
differentiator is the

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:53.190
convolution of the input with
the impulse response.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:58.100
And so what u_1(t) does under
convolution is to

00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:59.780
differentiate.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.770
And that is the operational
definition.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.450
And now, of course, we can
think of extending that.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:11.540
Not only would we want to think
about differentiating an

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.960
impulse, but we would also
want to think about

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.740
differentiating the derivative
of an impulse.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:23.000
We'll define that as
a function u_2(t).

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.690
u_2(t)--

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:28.050
because we have this impulse
response convolved with this

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:31.700
one is u_1(t) * u_1(t).

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:36.800
And what is u_2(t)
operationally?

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.800
It is the operation such that
when you convolve that with

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.540
x(t), what you get is the
second derivative.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.110
OK now, we can carry this
further and, in fact, talk

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:59.410
about the result of convolving
u_1(t) with itself more times.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.870
In fact, if we think of the
convulution of u_1(t) with

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.460
itself k times, then
logically we would

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.330
define that as u_k(t).

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.800
Again, we would interpret
that operationally.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:20.440
And the operational definition
is through convolution, where

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:26.600
this corresponds to u_k(t) being
the impulse response of

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.630
k differentiators in cascade.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.090
So what is the operational
definition?

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:39.800
Well, it's simply that x(t)
* u_k(t) is the k

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.440
derivative of x(t).

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.480
And this now gives us a set
of what are referred to as

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.720
singularity functions.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.360
Very badly behaved
mathematically in a sense, but

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.700
as we've seen, reasonably well
defined under an operational

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.780
definition.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:06.010
With k = 0, incidentally, that's
the same as what we

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:08.560
have referred to previously
as the impulse.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:13.260
So with k 0, that's
just delta(t).

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:17.150
Now to be complete, we can also
go the other way and talk

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.940
about the impulse response of
a string of integrators

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.460
instead of a string of
differentiators.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.280
Of course, the impulse
response of a single

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.580
integrator is a unit step.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.120
Two integrators together
is the integral of a

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.680
unit step, et cetera.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.110
And that, likewise, corresponds
to a set of what

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:40.290
are called singularity
functions.

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:46.410
In particular, if I take a
string of m integrators in

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:52.610
cascade, then the impulse
response of that is denoted as

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.000
u sub minus m of t.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.380
And for example, with a single
integrator, u sub minus 1 of t

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:06.950
corresponds to our unit step as
we talked about previously.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:14.430
u sub minus 2 of t corresponds
to a unit ramp, et cetera.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.060
And there is, in fact, a reason
for choosing negative

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:22.850
values of the argument when
going in one direction near

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.370
integration as compared with
positive values of the

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.130
argument when going in the
other direction, namely

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:30.120
differentiation.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:38.110
In particular, we know that with
u sub minus m of t, the

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:44.520
operational definition is the
mth running integral.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.370
And likewise, u_k(t)--

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:51.040
so with a positive
sub script--

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.240
has an operational definition,
which is the derivative.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.290
So it's the kth derivative
of x(t).

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:08.070
And partly as a consequence of
that, if we take u_k(t) and

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:13.400
convolve it with u_l(t), the
result is the singularity

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.170
function with the subscript,
which is the sum of k and l.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.470
And that holds whether this
is positive values of the

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.610
subscript or negative values
of the subscript.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:28.550
So just to summarize this last
discussion, we've used an

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:35.520
operational definition to talk
about derivatives of impulses

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.940
and integrals of impulses.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.705
This led to a set of singularity
functions-- what

00:53:40.705 --> 00:53:42.270
I've called singularity
functions--

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.400
of which the impulse and the
step are two examples.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.700
But using an operational
definition through convolution

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:55.500
allows us to define, at least in
an operational sense, these

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.880
functions that otherwise
are very badly behaved.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:06.330
OK now, in this lecture and
previous lectures, for the

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:10.890
most part, our discussion
has been about linear

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:14.910
time-invariant systems in
fairly general terms.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:18.480
And we've seen a variety of
properties, representation

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.390
through convolution, and
properties as they can be

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.750
associated with the
impulse response.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:28.970
In the next lecture, we'll turn
our attention to a very

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:34.150
important subclass of those
systems, namely systems that

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:37.410
are describable by linear
constant-coefficient

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.640
difference equations in the
discrete-time case, and linear

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.540
constant-coefficient
differential equations in the

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.410
continuous-time case.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:50.800
Those classes, while not forming
all of the class of

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.080
linear time-invariant
systems, are a very

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.930
important sub class.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.470
And we'll focus in on those
specifically next time.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:58.720
Thank you.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.760
PROFESSOR: OK, in
that case we can

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.850
jump into the early universe.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.000
So on the opening slide
here I have a picture

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.210
of the Planck satellite,
which is a satellite that

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.810
was launched a few years
ago dedicated to measuring

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.199
the cosmic background radiation.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.740
Cosmic background
radiation is really

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.830
our biggest clue for the
early history of the universe.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.780
The Planck satellite is
actually the third satellite

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.510
to go up completely dedicated to
measuring the cosmic background

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.500
radiation.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.380
The first was called COBE
and then WMAP and now Planck.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.320
Planck is still in orbit.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.270
It actually is finished
with its data-taking,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.400
although it's
nowhere near finished

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.480
with the analysis of that data.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.240
So they made one major
data release last March,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.030
and there are still very
important pieces of their data

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.180
that I haven't looked at yet.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.490
And we'll be talking
more about what exactly

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.860
these satellites see.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.330
Onward.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.970
I want to begin by talking about
the standard Big Bang, which

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.640
will in fact be the main
focus of this course.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.170
We'll probably spend about 2/3
of the course or so talking

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.610
about the standard Big
Bang and then move on

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.590
to topics like inflation.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.120
That actually is, I think,
a very sensible balance,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.690
because as you'll see once we
get under studying inflation,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.096
it's a fairly straightforward
thing once you know

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:03.440
the basic equations coming
out of standard cosmology.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.490
So I think spending about
2/3 of the term or so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.180
on the conventional cosmology
before we get to inflation

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.230
is very sensible, because that
will set up all the principles

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.480
that we'll be using
later to discuss more

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.260
advanced topics like inflation.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.640
The conventional Big Bang
model is basically the theory

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.430
that the universe as
we know it began some

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.000
13 to 14 billion years ago.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.200
And now we even have a
pretty precise number

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.780
to replace this 13
to 14 billion years.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.360
This is based on
the Planck satellite

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.920
combined with a few other
pieces of information.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.740
The number is 13.82 billion
years, plus or minus 0.05.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.860
So it's pretty well
pinned down now,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.300
the age of the universe
since the Big Bang.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.350
I should add, though, I put
in the qualifier "the universe

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.810
as we know it."

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.500
What that really means is
that I want to leave it out,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.850
because we don't really
know that the universe began

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.862
with what we call the Big Bang.

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:04.820
So we have a very good
picture of the Big Bang,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.490
and we're very confident
that it happened

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.850
and that we understand
what it looked like.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.600
But whether or not
anything came before it

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.350
is a much more open
question which I think

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.660
is really completely open.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.640
I think we should not act like
we know that the universe began

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.444
with the Big Bang.

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:23.610
And in fact later at the
very end of the course when

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.920
we discuss some of the
implications of inflation

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.000
and the multiverse,
we'll see that there are

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.510
strong suggestions that the
Big Bang was perhaps not really

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.710
the beginning of
existence, but really

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.330
just the beginning of
our local universe,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.170
often called a pocket universe.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.370
OK.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.130
In any case, what the
Big Bang theory tells

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.370
us is that at least our
region of the universe

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.340
13.82 billion years ago was an
extremely hot, dense, uniform

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.490
soup of particles, which in the
conventional standard Big Bang

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.070
model filled literally
all of space.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.430
And now we certainly believe
it filled essentially all

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.150
the space that we have
access to uniformly.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.830
Now I should point
out that this is

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.890
contrary to a popular cartoon
image of the Big Bang, which

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.440
is just plain wrong.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.019
The cartoon image
of the Big Bang

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.385
is the image of a small egg
of highly dense matter that

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:27.760
then exploded and spewed
out into empty space.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.910
That is not the scientific
picture of the Big Bang.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.410
And the reason is not
because it's illogical.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.010
It's hard to know what's logical
or illogical in this context.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.760
But simply based on
what we see, if there

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.370
was a small egg that
exploded into empty space,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.157
you would certainly
expect that today you

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:50.740
would see something different
if you were looking toward where

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.190
the egg was versus looking
the opposite direction.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.290
But we don't see any
effect like that.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.160
When we look around
the sky, the universal

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.197
looks completely uniform, on
average, in all directions

00:05:03.197 --> 00:05:04.530
to very high degree of accuracy.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.160
I'll talk a little bit
more precisely later.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.620
So we don't see any sign of an
egg having happened anywhere.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.100
Rather the Big
Bang seems to have

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.350
happened everywhere uniformly.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.070
OK.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.380
The Big Bang describes a
number of important things,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.940
and we'll be talking about this
more as the course goes on.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.580
It describes how the early
universe expanded and cooled--

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.700
and will be spending a fair
amount of time understanding

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.330
the details behind those words.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.510
The point is that
the Big Bang really

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.100
is a very precise model based
on very simple assumptions.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.020
You basically assume
that the early universe

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.550
was filled by a hot gas
in thermal equilibrium.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.250
And that this gas was
expanding and being pulled back

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.120
by gravity.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.060
And from those simple ideas
you can really calculate--

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.450
and we'll learn
how to calculate--

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.190
how fast the universe would
have been expanding at any given

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.550
instant of time, what the
temperature would have been

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.590
at any given instant of time,
what the density of matter

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.810
would have been at
any instant of time.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.800
So all the details
really can be calculated

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.290
from some rather
simple ideas, and we'll

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.760
have fun exploring that.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.260
The Big Bang also talks
about how the light chemical

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.610
elements formed.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.090
And that actually
is the main topic

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.934
of Steve Weinberg's book
"The First Three Minutes."

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:27.350
Because that was more or less
the time period during which

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.080
the chemical elements formed.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.990
It turns out that most of
the elements in the universe

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.530
did not form in the Big
Bang, but formed much later

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.340
in the interior of stars.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.010
And those elements are
then strewn out into space

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.660
in supernova explosions and
collected into later generation

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.130
stars, of which our
sun would be one.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.780
So the stuff that we're made
out of was actually not produced

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.850
in the Big Bang, but
rather was produced

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.850
in the interior of some distant
star that exploded long ago.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.960
And maybe many
stars, whose material

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.190
collected to form
our solar system.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.340
Nonetheless, most of the matter
in the universe-- as opposed

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.609
to most of the different
kinds of elements--

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:14.650
did form in the Big Bang.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.780
Most of the matter
in the universe

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.970
is just hydrogen and helium.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.180
About five different isotopes
of hydrogen, helium, and lithium

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.400
were primarily formed
in the Big Bang,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.470
and because we do have this
detailed picture of the Big

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.340
Bang that we'll
be learning about,

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.420
it's possible to
actually calculate

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.200
the predicted abundances of
those different isotopes.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.400
And the predictions agree very
well with the observations.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.320
And this is certainly one
of the major confirmations

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.660
we have that this picture
of the Big Bang is correct.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.620
We can predict what the
abundance of helium-3

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.890
should be, and we measure
it, and it agrees.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.155
It's rather marvelous.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.412
Finally-- and this
subject we're not

00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:01.870
going to talk about
much because it

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.250
goes beyond the
level of complexity

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.690
that the course
is going to have--

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.690
but finally the Big
Bang does discuss

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.540
how the matter ultimately
congealed to form stars,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.460
galaxies, clusters of galaxies.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.460
We'll talk about
that a little bit,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.370
but we won't really
follow that very far.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.440
That is still in principle
a work in progress.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.330
People do not understand
everything about galaxies.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
But the general picture
of that-- it started out

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.190
with an almost uniform
universe, and then

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.020
the lumps congealed to form the
galaxies and the structures--

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.059
we say certainly seems
to be a working picture.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.799
And one can understand
a lot about the universe

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.020
from this very simple picture.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.429
OK what I want to
talk about next

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.950
is what the conventional
Big Bang theory does not

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.430
talk about, where new ideas
like inflation come in.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.800
First of all, the
conventional Big Bang theory

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.460
does not say anything about
what caused the expansion.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.280
It really is only a theory
of the aftermath of a bang.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.700
In the scientific
version of the Big Bang,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.350
the universe starts with
everything already expanding

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.800
with no explanation of how
that expansion started.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.550
That's not part of
the Big Bang theory.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.440
So the scientific version
of the Big Bang theory

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.100
is not really a
theory of a bang.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.790
It's really the theory of
the aftermath of a bang.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.430
In addition, and maybe
in a similar vein,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.020
the conventional
Big Bang theory says

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.850
nothing about where all
the matter came from.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.690
The theory really assumes that
for every particle that we

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.210
see in the universe
today, there was

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.950
at the very beginning at
least some precursor particle,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.530
if not the same particle,
with no explanation of where

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.730
all those particles came from.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.130
In short, what I like to say is
that the Big Bang says nothing

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.580
about what banged,
why it banged,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.100
or what happened
before it banged.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.530
It really has no
bang in the Big Bang.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.060
It's a bangless theory,
despite its name.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.320
Inflation, it turns out,
fills in possible answers,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.850
very plausible answers, for
many of these questions.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.750
And that's what I'll
be talking about mainly

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.767
for the rest of today.

00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:16.350
And as I said, in
terms of the course,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.815
it's where we'll be aiming
to get about 2/3 of the way

00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:19.690
through the semester.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.890
What is cosmic inflation?

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.160
It's basically a
minor modification,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.070
in terms of the overall
scheme of things,

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.980
of the standard Big Bang theory.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.900
And the best word to describe
it is a word that I think

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.220
was invented by
Hollywood-- inflation

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.340
is a prequel to the
conventional Big Bang theory.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.060
It's a short description
of what happened before,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.770
immediately before,
the Big Bang.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.420
So inflation really
is an explanation

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.660
of the bang of the
Big Bang in the sense

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.670
that it does provide a
theory of the propulsion that

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:03.490
drove the universe into this
humongous episode of expansion

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.440
which we call the Big Bang.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.730
And it does it in
terms of something

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.350
that I like to think of
as a miracle of physics.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:17.230
When I use the word "miracle"
in this context-- referring

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.030
to a miracle in the
scientific sense--

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.760
simply something that's
so surprising that I think

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.340
it merits being called a miracle
even though it's something

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.834
that's a part of
the laws of physics.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:31.000
There are just a few features
of the laws of physics

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.770
that are actually
crucial to inflation--

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.180
I'll be talking
about two of them--

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.770
which I consider miracles
simply because-- well,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.830
mainly because when I
was an undergrad nobody

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.670
talked about them at all.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.970
They were just not
part of physics then,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.460
even though they really were.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.610
They just weren't
parts of physics people

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.480
noticed and talked about.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.550
So the miracle of physics
I'm talking about here

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.190
is something which
actually is known

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.790
since the time of Einstein's
general relativity--

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.540
that gravity is not
always attractive.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.140
Gravity can act repulsively.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:08.650
And Einstein introduced
this in 1916, I guess,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.160
in the form of what he called
his cosmological constant.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.280
And the original
motivation of modifying

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.300
the equations of general
relativity to allow this

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.480
was because Einstein thought
that the universe was static.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.420
And he realized that
ordinary gravity

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.711
would cause the universe to
collapse if it were static.

00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:29.330
It couldn't remain static.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.740
So he introduced this
cosmological constant term

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.830
to balance the overall
attraction of ordinary gravity

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.560
to be able to build a static
model of the universe.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.920
As you'll soon be learning,
that's dead wrong.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.761
That's not what the
universe looks like at all.

00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:47.260
But the fact that
general relativity

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.214
can support this
gravitation repulsion, still

00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:51.880
being consistent with
all the principles

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.440
that general relativity
incorporates,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.600
is the important
thing which Einstein

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.890
himself did discover
in this context.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.530
And inflation takes advantage
of this possibility,

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.330
within the context of
general relativity,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.510
to let gravity be the
repulsive force that

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.320
drove the universe into
the period of expansion

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.830
that we call the Big Bang.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.090
And in fact when one
combines general relativity

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:25.290
with conventional ideas
now in particle physics,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.530
there really is a
pretty clear indication,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.410
I should say-- not quite a
prediction-- but a pretty clear

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.830
indication that at very
high energy densities,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.660
one expects to find states of
matter which literally turn

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.794
gravity on its head and cause
gravity to become repulsive.

00:13:41.794 --> 00:13:44.210
In terms of the details which
we'll be learning about more

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.470
later, what it takes to
produce gravitational repulsion

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.090
is a negative pressure.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.770
According to general
relativity, it turns out--

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.350
and we'll be talking more about
this later-- both pressures

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.660
and energy densities can
produce gravitational fields.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.710
Unlike Newtonian physics,
where it's only mass densities

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.800
that produce
gravitational fields.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.610
And the positive
pressure produces

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.680
an attractive
gravitational field,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.320
which is what you would
probably guess if somebody just

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.300
asked you to guess.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.300
Positive pressures are
sort of normal pressures,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.110
and attractive gravity
is normal gravity.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.110
So normal pressures
produce normal gravity.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.360
But it is possible to
have negative pressures,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.040
and negative pressures
produce repulsive gravity.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.845
That's the secret of what
makes inflation possible.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.720
So inflation proposes that
at least a small patch

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.850
of this repulsive
gravity material

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.820
existed in the early universe.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.110
We don't really
know exactly when

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.344
in the history of the
universe inflation happened,

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:51.510
which is another way of
saying we don't know exactly

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.840
at what energy scale
inflation happened.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.657
But a very logical,
plausible choice--

00:14:57.657 --> 00:14:59.990
I don't know if logical is
the right word, but plausible

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.090
is a good word--
very plausible choice

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.840
for when inflation
might have happened,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.580
would be when the energy
scales of the universe where

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.520
at the scale of grand
unified theories.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.340
Grand unified theories-- we'll
talk about a little bit later--

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.700
are theories which
unify the weak, strong,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.990
and electromagnetic
interactions into

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.950
a single unified interaction.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.600
And that unification occurs at
a typical energy of about 10

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.830
to the 16 GeV, where GeV,
in case you don't know,

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.150
is about the mass--
or the energy

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.130
equivalent of the
mass-- of a proton.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.630
So we're talking
about energies that

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.960
are about 10 to the 16 times the
equivalent energy of a proton

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.880
mass.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.330
And at those energies we
think that these states that

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.340
create repulsive gravity
are very likely to exist.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.400
And if that happened
at that scale,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.790
the initial patch
would only have

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.450
to be the ridiculously
small size of about 10

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.460
to the minus 28
centimeters across

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.180
to be able to lead ultimately
to the creation of everything

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.405
that we see on the vast
scale at which we see it.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.170
The patch certainly does not
have to be the entire universe.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.890
And it could in fact
be incredibly rare,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.250
because one thinks that outside
of that patch essentially

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.850
nothing will happen interesting.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.400
So we expect that the
universe that we observe today

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.280
would be entirely the
consequence of such a patch.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.110
The gravitational
repulsion created

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.360
by this small patch of
repulsive gravity material

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.780
would be then the driving
force of the Big Bang,

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.500
and it would cause the region to
undergo exponential expansion.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.820
And by exponential expansion,
as you probably know,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.776
it means that there's a
certain doubling time,

00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:48.150
and if you wait the same amount
of time it doubles again.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.500
If you wait the same amount
of time, it doubles again.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.230
And because these doublings
build up so dramatically,

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.945
it doesn't take very much time
to build the whole universe.

00:16:57.945 --> 00:17:02.340
In about 100 doublings,
this tiny patch

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.569
of 10 to the minus
28 centimeters

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.000
can become large enough
not to be the universe,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.109
but to be a small marble
size region, which will then

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.440
ultimately become
the observed universe

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.504
as it continues to coast
outward after inflation ends.

00:17:20.504 --> 00:17:22.420
So the doubling time
would be incredibly small

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.670
if this was all happening
at the grand unified theory

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.940
set of numbers-- 10 to the
minus 37 seconds, which

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.840
is pretty fast.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.450
The patch would
expand exponentially

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.300
by at least a factor of about 10
to the 28, which as I mentioned

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.672
takes only about 100
doublings, and could

00:17:42.672 --> 00:17:43.630
expand to be much more.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.930
There's no cut off there.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.610
If there's more
expansion than we

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.690
need to produce our
universe, it just

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.960
means that the patch of
universe that we're living in

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.800
is larger than we see.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.320
But that's OK.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.880
Everything that we see looks
uniform as far as we can see,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.879
and how much there is
beyond that we really just

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.150
have no way of knowing.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.370
So larger amounts
of inflation are

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.399
perfectly consistent
with what we see.

00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:07.690
The amount of time it would
take would only be about 10

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.160
to the minus 35 seconds,
which is just 100 times 10

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.920
to the minus 37 if you can do
that complicated arithmetic

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.800
in your head.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.320
And the region that's destined
to become our presently

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.430
observed universe at
the end of inflation

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.425
would have been only about the
size of a marble-- about one

00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:26.550
centimeter or so across.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.550
Now what ends
inflation is the fact

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.190
that this repulsive gravity
material is unstable.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.150
So it decays, using the
word decay in the same sense

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.022
that a radioactive
substance decays.

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:44.480
It doesn't necessarily
mean exactly

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.030
that it rots like
an apple decays,

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.760
but it means that it turns
into other kinds of material.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.870
And in particular, it
turned into material

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.500
which is no longer
gravitationally repulsive.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.880
So the gravitational repulsion
ends, and in fact the particles

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.520
produced by this
energy that's released

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.570
at the end of inflation
become the hot soup

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.490
of the conventional Big Bang.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.830
And this is where
the prequel ends,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.030
and the main feature begins--
the conventional Big Bang

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.060
theory.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:20.470
The role of inflation is just
to set up the initial conditions

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.500
for the conventional
Big Bang theory.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.270
Now there's a
little caveat here.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.290
Inflation ends because
the material is unstable,

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.350
but it only ends
almost everywhere, not

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.760
quite everywhere.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.800
And this is basically the
way exponentials work.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.280
And we'll come back to this
when we talk about the late time

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.950
behavior and the idea
of eternal inflation.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.800
This repulsive gravity
material decays,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.710
but it decays like a radioactive
substance-- which is also

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.570
an exponential-- as a half life.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.670
But no matter how many
half lives you wait,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.160
there's still a tiny little bit,
a tiny fraction that remains.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.000
And that turns out to be
important for the idea

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.820
that in many cases inflation
never completely ends.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.190
We'll come back to that.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.100
So I want to talk more
about what goes on

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.280
during this exponential
expansion phase.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.360
There's a very peculiar
feature of this inflation--

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.560
this exponential
expansion driven

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.800
by repulsive gravity-- which
is that while it's happening,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.020
the mass density
or energy density

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.030
of the inflating material-- this
repulsive gravity material--

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.820
does not decrease.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.075
You would think that if
something doubled in radius,

00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:38.770
it would multiply by a
factor of eight in volume.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.770
You would think the energy
density would go down

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.330
by a factor of eight.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.950
And that certainly happens
for ordinary particles.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.575
It's certainly what
would happen if you

00:20:46.575 --> 00:20:48.320
had a gas, an ordinary
gas, that you just

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.460
allowed to expand
by a factor of two

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.222
in radius-- the density would
go down by a factor of eight

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:56.860
with volumes of
cubes of distances.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.890
But this peculiar repulsive
gravity material actually

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.450
expands at a constant density.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.910
Now that sounds like it must
violate conservation of energy,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.860
because it really does mean
that the total amount of energy

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.550
inside this expanding
volume is increasing.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.310
The energy per volume
is remaining constant,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:20.790
and the volume is getting
bigger and bigger exponentially.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:26.260
So the claim is that I've not
gone crazy, that this actually

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.120
is consistent with the laws
of physics as we know them.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.010
And that it is consistent
with conservation of energy.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.090
Conservation of energy really is
a sacred principle of physics.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.650
We don't know of anything
in nature that violates this

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.245
principle of
conservation of energy,

00:21:40.245 --> 00:21:44.000
that energy ultimately cannot
be either made or destroyed,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.102
that the total amount of
energy is basically fixed.

00:21:47.102 --> 00:21:49.060
So it sounds like there's
a contradiction here.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.059
How do we get out of it?

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:51.970
What's the resolution?

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.340
Well, this requires my
second miracle of physics.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.157
Energy-- it really
is exactly conserved.

00:21:58.157 --> 00:22:00.240
I'm not going to tell you
about any miracles which

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.070
changed that.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:07.320
But the catch here is
that energies are not

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.060
necessarily positive.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.560
There are things that
have negative energies.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.370
And in particular, the
gravitational field

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.870
has a negative energy.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:21.460
This statement by the way is
true both in Newtonian physics

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.630
and in general relativity.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.930
We'll prove it later.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:34.630
I might just say
quickly if some of you

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.400
have learned in an E&M course
how to talk about and calculate

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.810
the energy density of an
electrostatic field-- probably

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.800
many of you have,
maybe all of you

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.810
have-- the energy density
of an electrostatic field

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.510
is a constant times the square
of the electric field strength.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.420
And you can prove that
energy is exactly the energy

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.880
that you need to
put into a system

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.088
to create an electric field
of a given configuration.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.390
If you think about
Newton's law of gravity

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.192
and compare it
with Coulomb's law,

00:23:07.192 --> 00:23:08.983
you realize that it
really is the same law,

00:23:08.983 --> 00:23:11.320
except they have a different
constant in front of them.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.370
They're both inverse
square laws in proportion

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.850
to the two charges, where
in the case of gravity

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.310
it's the masses that
play the role of charges.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.075
But they have opposite signs.

00:23:22.075 --> 00:23:25.390
Two positive charges, as we
all know we tell each other,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.070
two positive masses
attract each other.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.980
So in fact the
very same argument

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.590
which allows you to calculate
the energy density of a Coulomb

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.810
field can allow you to
calculate the energy

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.150
density of a Newtonian
gravitational field-- still

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.910
sticking to Newtonian
physics-- and this change

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.660
in sign of the force
just carries through.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.810
It changes the signs of all
the work that's being done,

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.110
and you get the
negative answer that

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.732
is the correct answer
for Newtonian gravity.

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.940
The energy density of a
Newtonian gravitational field

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.810
is negative.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.490
And the same is true
in general relativity

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.210
in a more subtle way.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.510
So what that means in terms
of conservation of energy

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.990
is that we can have more
and more matter, more

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.870
and more energy building up in
the form of ordinary matter--

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.610
which is what happens during
inflation-- as long as there's

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.750
a compensating amount
of negative energy

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.420
that's created in the
gravitational field which

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.530
is filling this ever
larger region of space.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.380
And that's exactly what
happens in inflation.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.640
The positive energy of this
repulsive gravity material

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.970
which is growing and
growing in volume

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.620
is precisely canceled
by the negative energy

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.590
of the gravitational field
that's filling the region.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.590
So the total energy
does remain constant,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.200
as it must, and there's
certainly a good possibility

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.890
that the total energy
is exactly zero.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.869
Because everything
that we know of

00:24:48.869 --> 00:24:50.660
is at least consistent
with the possibility

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.950
that these two
numbers are exactly

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.680
equal to each other or
something very close.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.270
Schematically, the picture
is that if one thinks

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.050
about the total energy
of the universe,

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.480
it consists of a huge positive
amount in the form of matter

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.260
and radiation-- the
stuff that we see,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.250
the stuff that we
normally identify

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.260
the energy of-- but there's
also a huge negative amount

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.100
of energy in the gravitational
field that fills the universe.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.350
And as far as we
can tell, the sum

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.730
is at least consistent
with being 0.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.890
In any case, what
happens during inflation

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.530
is the black bar goes up
and the red bar goes down.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.370
And they go up and
down by equal amounts.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.960
So certainly what happens during
inflation conserves energy,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.940
as anything consistent with the
laws of physics that we know of

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.750
must conserve energy.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.491
I just remembered I was planning
to turn out these blackboard

00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:43.990
lights.

00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:50.130
It probably makes it a
little more comfortable

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.590
to watch the screen.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.090
OK.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.875
So, onward.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.740
I want to talk some about
the evidence for inflation.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.470
So far I've described
what inflation is--

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.460
and I'm sort of done describing
what inflation is for today.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.056
As I said, we'll be coming
back and talking about all this

00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:09.180
during the coming semester.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.770
Now let's move on to
discuss some of the reasons

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.960
why we think that our universe
may very likely have actually

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.430
undergone this process
called inflation

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.070
I was just telling you about.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.330
So there are three things
I want to talk about.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.850
The first of which is the
large scale uniformity

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.200
of the universe.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.440
Which is related to what I
told you at the beginning,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.580
that if you look out
in different directions

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.610
in the universe, it really looks
the same in all directions.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.010
And the object that can
be measured with the most

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.780
precision in terms of how
things vary with angle,

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.420
is the cosmic
background radiation--

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.840
because we can measure
it from all directions,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.450
and it's essentially
a uniform background.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.530
And when that's been
done, what's been found

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.190
is that the radiation is uniform
to the incredible accuracy

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.430
of about one part in
100,000-- which really

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:04.250
is a rather spectacular
level of uniformity.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:08.900
So it means the universe really
is rather incredibly uniform.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.540
I might mention one proviso here
just to be completely accurate.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.170
When one actually just goes
out and measures the radiation,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.530
one finds something-- one
finds an asymmetry that's

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.340
larger than what I just said.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.400
One finds an asymmetry
of about 1 part in 1,000,

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.370
with one direction being hotter
than the opposite direction.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:34.300
But that 1 part in 1,000 effect
we interpret as our motion

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.070
through the cosmic background
radiation, which makes it

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.890
look hotter in one
direction and colder

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.840
in the opposite direction.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.560
And the effect of our motion
has a very definite angular

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.160
pattern.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.030
We have no other way of
knowing what our velocity is

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.700
relative to the cosmic
background radiation.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.255
So we just measure it
from this asymmetry,

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.130
but we're restricted.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.890
We can't let it
account for everything.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.140
Because it has a very
different angular form,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.490
we only get to
determine one velocity.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.940
And once we determine that,
that determines one asymmetry

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.700
and you can subtract that out.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.890
And then the
residual asymmetries,

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:12.130
the asymmetries that we cannot
account for by saying that

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.600
the Earth has a certain
velocity relative to the cosmic

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.780
background radiation, those
asymmetries are at the level

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:22.040
of 1 part in 100,000.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.210
And this is 1 part in
100,000 that we attribute

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.730
to the universe and not to
the motion of the earth.

00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:29.750
OK.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.170
So to understand
the implications

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.700
of this incredible
degree of uniformity,

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.400
we need to say a
little bit about what

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.970
we think the history of this
cosmic background radiation

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.760
was.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.900
And what our theories
tell us-- and we'll

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.110
be learning about
this in detail--

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.720
is that in the
early period-- Yes.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.220
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220
I'm curious.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.220
When they released
WMAP and stuff,

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.219
did they already subtract
out the relativistic effect?

00:28:56.219 --> 00:28:58.510
PROFESSOR: Well, the answer
is that they analyze things

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.960
according to angular
patterns and how

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.040
they fit different
angular patterns.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.427
So in fact, I think they don't
even report it with WMAP,

00:29:05.427 --> 00:29:07.010
but it would be what
they would call L

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.280
equals 1, the dipole term.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.940
They analyze the dipole,
quadrupole, octupole, et

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.506
cetera.

00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:15.630
So it really does not
contribute at all to anything

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.330
except that L
equals 1 term, which

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.160
is one out of 1,800
things that they measure.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.715
So basically, I
think they don't even

00:29:22.715 --> 00:29:24.090
bother reporting
that one number,

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.506
and therefore it's
subtracted out.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.220
OK.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.970
Do feel free to ask
questions, by the way.

00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:39.657
I think it's certainly
a small enough class

00:29:39.657 --> 00:29:40.490
that we can do that.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:43.880
OK.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.920
So what I was about to
say is that this radiation

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.480
during the early period of the
universe, when the universe was

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.140
a plasma, the radiation
was essentially

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.050
locked to the matter.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.030
The photons were moving
at the speed of light,

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.330
but in the plasma there's
a very large cross section

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.720
for the photons to scatter
off of the free electrons

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.730
in a plasma.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:12.240
Which basically means that the
photons move with the matter--

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.370
because when they're
moving on their own,

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.870
they just move a
very short distance

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.140
and then scatter, and then
move in a different direction.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.723
So relative to the
matter, the photons

00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:22.160
go nowhere during the
first 400,000 years

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.380
of the history of the universe.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.950
But then at about 400,000
years the universe

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.640
cools enough-- this
is all according

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.420
to our calculations--
the universe cools

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.690
enough so that the
plasma neutralizes.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.240
And when the plasma neutralizes,
it becomes a neutral gas

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.730
like the air in this room.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:44.130
And the air in this room seems
completely transparent to us,

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.750
and it turns out
that actually does

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.330
extrapolate to the universe.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.850
The gas that filled the universe
after it neutralized really

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.920
was transparent, and it means
that a typical photon that we

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.080
see today in the cosmic
background radiation

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.440
really has been traveling on
a straight line since about

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.870
400,000 years
after the Big Bang.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.460
Which in turn means that when
we look at the cosmic background

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.530
radiation, we're
essentially seeing

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.780
an image of what the universe
looked like at 400,000 years

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.110
after the Big Bang.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.730
Just as the light traveling
from my face to your eyes

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.579
gives you an image
of what I look like.

00:31:25.579 --> 00:31:27.870
So that's what we're seeing--
a picture of the universe

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.480
at the age of 400,000
years, and it's

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:36.880
bland-- uniform to
1 part in 100,000.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.970
So the question then
is, can we explain

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.990
how the universe
to be so uniform?

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:48.320
And it turns out that if you--
Well, I should say first of all

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.000
that if you're
willing to just assume

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.980
that the universe started out
perfectly uniform to better

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.550
than one part in
100,000, that's OK.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.650
Nobody could stop
you from doing that.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:01.270
But if you want to try to
explain this uniformity

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.440
without assuming that it was
there from the beginning, then

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.630
within the context of the
conventional Big Bang theory,

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.400
it's just not possible.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.060
And the reason is that within
the evolution equations

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.510
of the conventional Big Bang
theory, you can calculate--

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.250
and we will calculate
later in the course--

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.510
that in order to smooth things
out in time for it to look

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.530
smooth in the cosmic
background radiation,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.050
you have to be able to move
around matter and energy

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.320
at about 100 times
the speed of light.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.000
Or else you just couldn't do it.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.500
And we don't know of anything
in physics that happens faster

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.054
than the speed of light.

00:32:40.054 --> 00:32:42.720
So within physics as we know it,
and within the conventional Big

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.410
Bang theory, there's no way to
explain this uniformity except

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.380
to just assume that maybe it was
there from the very beginning.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.980
For reasons that we
don't know about.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.490
On the other hand, inflation
takes care of this very nicely.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.330
What inflation does
is it adds this spurt

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:04.910
of exponential expansion to
the history of the universe.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.990
And the fact that this
exponential expansion

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.040
was so humongous
means that if you

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.270
look at our picture
of the universe

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.530
before the inflation
happened, the universe

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.880
would have been vastly smaller
than in conventional cosmology

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.120
which would not have this
exponential spurt of expansion.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.010
So in the inflationary
model there

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:29.060
would've been plenty of
time for the observed

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.230
part of the universe to become
uniform before inflation

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:36.002
started-- when it
was incredibly tiny.

00:33:36.002 --> 00:33:38.460
And then would become uniform
just like the air in the room

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.312
here tends to spread out and
produce a uniform distribution

00:33:41.312 --> 00:33:43.270
of air rather than having
all the air collected

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.830
in one corner.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.320
Once that uniformity
is established

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.540
on this tiny region,
inflation would then

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.077
take over and
stretch this region

00:33:51.077 --> 00:33:52.910
to become large enough
to include everything

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.390
that we now see,
thereby explaining

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.560
why everything that we
see looks so uniform.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.170
It's a very simple
explanation, and it's

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.330
only possible with
inflation and not

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.000
within the conventional
Big Bang theory.

00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:09.255
So, the inflationary solution.

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:11.250
In inflationary
models the universe

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:16.384
begins so small that uniformity
is easily established.

00:34:16.384 --> 00:34:18.550
Just like the air in the
lecture hall-- same analogy

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.500
I used-- spreads uniformly
to fill the lecture hall.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.250
Then inflation
stretches the region

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.699
to become large enough
to include everything

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:29.441
that we now observe.

00:34:29.441 --> 00:34:29.940
OK.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.880
So that's the first
of my three pieces

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.860
of evidence for inflation.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.545
The second one is something
called the flatness problem.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:45.139
And the question is, why was
the early universe so flat?

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.449
And the first question
maybe is, what am I

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.639
talking about when I say
the early universe was flat?

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.840
One misconception
I sometimes find

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.242
people getting is that flat
often means two dimensional.

00:34:56.242 --> 00:34:57.200
That's not what I mean.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.500
It's not flat like a
two dimensional pancake.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.190
It's three dimensional.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.670
The flat in this context
means Euclidean--

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.870
obeying the axioms of
Euclidean geometry-- as opposed

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.370
to the non-Euclidean
options that

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.780
are offered by
general relativity.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:18.190
General relativity allows three
dimensional space to be curved.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:25.014
And if we only consider uniform
curvature, which is-- we

00:35:25.014 --> 00:35:26.430
don't see any
curvature, actually,

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.105
but-- We know with
better accuracy

00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:34.420
that the universe is uniform
than we do that it's flat.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.930
So imagine in terms of
discussion of cosmology

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.470
three possible curvatures for
the universe, all of which

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.970
would be taken to be uniform.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:47.300
Three dimensional curved spaces
are not easy to visualize,

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.670
but all three of
these are closely

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.140
analogous to two dimensional
curved spaces, which

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.590
are easy to think about.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:59.690
One is the closed geometry
of the surface of a sphere.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.950
Now the analogy is that the
three dimensional universe

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.658
would be analogous to
the two dimensional

00:36:03.658 --> 00:36:05.320
surface of a sphere.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.820
The analogy changes the
number of dimensions.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.350
But important things get capped.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.650
Like for example on the
surface of a sphere,

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.470
you can easily visualize--
and there's even

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.660
a picture to show
you-- that if you

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.100
put a triangle on the
surface of a sphere,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.130
the sum of the three
angles at the vertices

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.740
would be more than 180 degrees.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.100
Unlike the Euclidean case,
where it's always 180 degrees.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:32.600
Question?

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.330
Is the 3D curving happening
in a fourth dimension?

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.859
Just like these 2D models
assume another dimension?

00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:40.900
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.560
The question was,
is the 3D curvature

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.530
happening in a fourth dimension
just like this 2D curvature

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.300
is happening in a
third dimension?

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.820
The answer I guess is yes.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.590
But I should maybe clarify
the "just like" part.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.060
The third dimension here from
a strictly mathematical point

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.050
of view allows us to visualize
the sphere in an easy way,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.650
but the geometry of the
sphere from the point of view

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:12.030
of people who study differential
geometry is a perfectly well

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.110
defined two dimensional
space without any need

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.110
for the third
dimension to be there.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.490
The third dimension is
really just a crutch for us

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.010
to visualize it.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.900
But that same crutch does work
in going from three to four.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.940
And in fact when we study the
three dimensional curved space

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.260
of the closed universe, we will
in fact do it exactly that way.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.170
We'll introduce the same crutch,
imagine it in four dimensions,

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.819
and it will be very closely
analogous to the two

00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.610
dimensional picture
that you're looking at.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.460
OK.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.537
So one of the possibilities
is a closed geometry

00:37:46.537 --> 00:37:48.495
where the sum of the
three angles of a triangle

00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:51.206
is always bigger
than 180 degrees.

00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:52.830
Another possibility
is something that's

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.760
usually described
as saddle shaped,

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.500
or a space of
negative curvature.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.490
And in that case the sum
of the three angles--

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.340
they get pinched, and
the sum of the angles

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.260
is less than 180 degrees.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.240
And only for the flat case is
the sum of the three angles

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.540
exactly 180 degrees, which is
the case of Euclidean geometry.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.220
The geometries on the
surfaces of these objects

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.530
is non-Euclidean,
even though if you

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.940
think of the three dimensional
geometry of the objects

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.060
embedded in three dimensional
space, that's still Euclidean.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.080
But the restricted geometry to
the two dimensional surfaces

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.320
are non-Euclidean there and
there, but Euclidean there.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.630
And that's exactly the way it
works in general relativity.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:38.260
There are closed universes with
positive curvature and the sum

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.970
of angles being more
than 180 degrees.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.640
And there are open universes
where the sum of three angles

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.940
is always less than 180 degrees.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.540
And there's the
flat case-- which

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.320
is just on the
borderline of those two--

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.380
where Euclidean geometry works.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.436
And the point is
that in our universe,

00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:56.060
Euclidean geometry
does work very well.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.100
That's why we all learned
it in high school.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.847
And in fact we have
very good evidence

00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:01.930
that the early universe
was rather extraordinarily

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.210
close to this flat case
of Euclidean geometry.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.520
And that's what we're trying
to understand and explain.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.640
According to general relativity
this flatness of the geometry

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.530
is determined by
the mass density.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.820
There's a certain value
of the mass density called

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.593
the critical density-- which
depends on the expansion rate,

00:39:24.593 --> 00:39:27.300
by the way, it's not a
universal constant of any kind.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.400
But for a given
expansion rate one

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.180
can calculate a
critical density,

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.870
and that critical
density is the density

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.110
which makes the universe flat.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:43.440
And cosmologists define a number
called omega-- capital omega--

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.270
which is just the ratio
of the actual mass

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:49.090
density to the
critical mass density.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.486
So omega equals 1 says
the actual density is

00:39:51.486 --> 00:39:52.860
the critical
density, which means

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.800
the universe would be flat.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:00.500
Omega bigger than 1 would be
a closed universe, and omega

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.715
less than 1 would
be an open universe.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.680
What's peculiar about the
evolution of this omega

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.550
quantity is that omega
equals 1 as the universe

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.970
evolves in
conventional cosmology

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:19.590
behaves very much like a
pencil balancing on its tip.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.250
It's an unstable
equilibrium point.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:28.190
So in other words, if omega
was exactly equal to 1

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:32.080
in the early universe, it would
remain exactly equal to 1.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.540
Just like a pencil that's
perfectly balanced on its tip

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.460
would not know which way to
fall and would in principle stay

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.120
there forever.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.170
At least with
classical mechanics.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.500
We won't include quantum
mechanics for our pencil.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.440
Classical pencil that we're
using for the analogy.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.470
But if the pencil leans just
a tiny bit in any direction,

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.050
it will rapidly start to
fall over in that direction.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.680
And similarly if omega
in the early universe

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.850
was just slightly
greater than 1,

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.621
it would rapidly rise
towards infinity.

00:41:04.621 --> 00:41:05.870
And this is a closed universe.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.786
Infinity really means
the universe has reached

00:41:07.786 --> 00:41:11.160
its maximum size, and it
turns around and collapses.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.770
And if omega was
slightly less than 1,

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.204
it would rapidly
dribble off to 0,

00:41:15.204 --> 00:41:16.870
and the universe would
just become empty

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.930
as it rapidly expands.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.735
So the only way for omega
to be close to 1 today--

00:41:23.735 --> 00:41:25.870
and as far as we can
tell, omega is consistent

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.720
with 1 today-- the only
way that can happen

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.120
is if omega started out
unbelievably close to 1.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.740
Unless it's this pencil
that's been standing there

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:40.330
for 14 billion years and
hasn't fallen over yet.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.590
Numerically, for omega to be
somewhere in the allowed range

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.600
today, which is
very close to 1, it

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.080
means that omega at one
second after the Big Bang

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.930
had to be equal to 1 to the
incredible accuracy of 15

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.930
decimal places.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.860
Which makes the value
of the mass density

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.379
of the universe at one second
after the Big Bang probably

00:42:01.379 --> 00:42:03.420
the most accurate number
that we know in physics.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.430
Since we really know it
to 15 decimal places.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.805
So if it wasn't
in that range, it

00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:09.390
wouldn't be in the
[? lab manuals ?] today.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.630
We have this
amplification effect

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.450
of the evolution
of the universe.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.700
So the question is,
how did this happen?

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.420
In conventional Big Bang theory,
the initial value of omega

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.830
could have been
anything, logically.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.720
To be consistent with
what we now observe it

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.570
has to be within this
incredibly narrow range,

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.590
but there's nothing
in the theory which

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.220
causes it to be in
that narrow range.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.430
So the question
is, why did omega

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:39.080
start out so
incredibly close to 1?

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.420
Like the earlier problem
about homogeneity,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:47.640
if you want to just assume
that it started out-- exactly

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.890
like, it had to be-- at omega
equals 1, you could do that.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.290
But if you want to have any
dynamical explanation for how

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.340
it got to be that
way, there's really

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.150
nothing in conventional
cosmology which does it.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.670
But in fact, inflation does.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:07.120
In the inflationary model we've
changed the evolution of omega

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.055
because we've turned gravity
into a repulsive force instead

00:43:10.055 --> 00:43:13.400
of an attractive force, and that
changes the way omega evolves.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.880
And it turns out that
during inflation, omega

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.670
is not driven away
from 1-- as it

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.770
is during the entire rest of
the history of the universe--

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.640
but rather during inflation
omega is driven rapidly

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.970
towards 1, exponentially
fast, even.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.680
So with the amount
of inflation that we

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:36.080
talked about-- inflation by a
factor of 10 to the 28 or so--

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.440
that's enough so that the
value of omega before inflation

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.720
is not very much constrained.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.505
Omega could have started out
before inflation not being 1,

00:43:45.505 --> 00:43:50.650
but being 2 or 10 or
1/10 or 100 or 1/100.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.760
The further away you
start omega from 1,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.697
the more inflation you need
to drive it to 1 sufficiently.

00:43:57.697 --> 00:43:59.280
But you don't need
much more inflation

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.410
to make it significantly
far away from 1

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:05.180
because of this fact the
inflation drives omega

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.360
to 1 exponentially.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.290
Which really means it's a
very powerful force driving

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.400
omega to 1.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.170
And giving us a very
simple, therefore,

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.830
explanation for why omega
in the early universe

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.310
appears to have been
extraordinarily close to 1.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.810
So I think that's-- Oh, I
have a few more things to say.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.400
There's actually a prediction
that comes out of this,

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.830
because this tendency of
inflation to drive omega to 1

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.740
is so strong, that you
expect that omega really

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.450
should be 1 today.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:42.550
Or to within
measurable accuracy.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.270
You could arrange
inflationary models

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.000
where it's say, 0.2--
which is what people used

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
to think it was-- but in order
to do that, you have to arrange

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
for inflation to end
at just the right time

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.470
before it makes it closer.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.990
Because every e-fold drives it
another factor of 10 closer.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:01.330
So it's very rapid effect.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:05.450
So if you don't fine tune
things very carefully, most

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:08.460
any inflationary model will
drive omega so close to 1

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.020
that today we would see it as 1.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.070
That did not used to
appear to be the case.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:20.050
Before 1998 astronomers
were pretty sure

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.355
that omega was only 0.2 or
0.3, while inflation seemed

00:45:24.355 --> 00:45:26.480
to have a pretty clear
prediction that omega should

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.340
be 1.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:32.260
This personally I found rather
uncomfortable, because it meant

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.520
whenever I had dinner
with astronomers,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.820
they would always sort
of snidely talk about

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.870
how inflation was
a pretty theory,

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.370
but it couldn't be right
because omega was 0.2,

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.520
and inflation was
predicting omega is 1.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.590
And it just didn't fit.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:50.639
Things changed a lot in 1998,
and now the best number we

00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:53.055
have-- which comes from the
Planck satellite combined with

00:45:53.055 --> 00:45:55.410
a few other
measurements, actually--

00:45:55.410 --> 00:46:00.890
is that now the observational
number for omega is 1.0010,

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:04.510
plus or minus 0.0065.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.990
So the 0.0065 is
the important thing.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.190
This is very, very close
to 1, but the error bars

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.200
are bigger than this difference.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.850
So it really means to about
a half a percent or maybe 1%,

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.880
we know today that
omega is 1, which

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.030
is what inflation would predict.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.045
That it should essentially
be exactly 1 today.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.850
The new ingredient that
made all this possible,

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.960
that drove-- changed
the measurement of omega

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.950
from 0.2 to 1 is
a new ingredient

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.540
to the energy budget of the
universe, the discovery of what

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.485
we call dark energy.

00:46:39.485 --> 00:46:41.360
And we'll be learning
a lot about dark energy

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.420
during the course of the term.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.120
The real discovery in 1998
was that the universe is not

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.880
slowing down under the
influence of gravity

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.177
as had been expected until that
time, but rather the universe

00:46:54.177 --> 00:46:55.218
actually is accelerating.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:03.300
And this acceleration has to
be attributed to something.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.750
The stuff that it's attributed
to is called the dark energy.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.150
And even though there's
considerable ignorance

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.509
of what exactly
this dark energy is,

00:47:11.509 --> 00:47:13.050
we can still calculate
how much of it

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.260
there's got to be in order to
produce the acceleration that's

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.160
seen.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.300
And when all that
is put together,

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.520
you get this number, which is
so much nicer for inflation

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.271
than the previous number.

00:47:25.271 --> 00:47:25.770
Yes.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.250
AUDIENCE: So, was the
accelerating universe

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.840
like the missing factor which
they-- gave a wrong assumption

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.200
which made them think
that omega was 0.2 or 0.3?

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.950
It was entirely
because they did not

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:37.210
know about the
acceleration at that time.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:41.090
They in fact were accurately
measuring the stuff

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.470
that they were looking at.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.320
And that does only
add up to 0.2 or 0.3.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.040
And this new ingredient,
the dark energy,

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.660
which we only know about
through the acceleration,

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.970
is what makes the difference.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:54.470
Yes.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.378
AUDIENCE: And that data
that they were measuring

00:47:56.378 --> 00:47:58.169
is really just sort of
the integrated stuff

00:47:58.169 --> 00:48:00.200
in the universe that we
see through telescopes?

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.870
Very straight-forward
in that way?

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:02.870
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:04.500
Including dark matter.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.700
So it's not everything
that we actually see.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.860
There's also-- not
going into it here,

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.370
but we will later in the
course-- there is also stuff

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.760
called dark matter, which is
different from dark energy.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.260
Even though matter and energy
are supposed to be the same,

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.430
they are different
in this context.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:19.540
And dark matter is
matter that we infer

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.550
exists due to its
effect on other matter.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:26.064
So by looking, for example,
at how fast galaxies rotate,

00:48:26.064 --> 00:48:27.480
you can figure out
how much matter

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.938
there must be inside
those galaxies

00:48:28.938 --> 00:48:32.294
to allow those
orbits to be stable.

00:48:32.294 --> 00:48:34.710
And that's significantly more
matter than we actually see.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:39.410
And that unseen matter is
called the dark matter,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:42.080
and that was added
into the 0.2 or 0.3.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:48.600
The visible matter
is only about 0.04.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.850
OK.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.260
So, so much for the
flatness problem.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.290
Next item I want talk about is
the small scale nonuniformity

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.284
of the universe.

00:48:58.284 --> 00:48:59.700
On the largest
scale, the universe

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.690
is incredibly uniform-- one
part in 100,000-- but on smaller

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:07.370
scales, the universe
today is incredibly lumpy.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.750
The earth is a big lump
in the mass density

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.850
distribution of the universe.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.920
The earth is in fact
about 10 to the 30 times

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.630
denser than the average matter
density in the universe.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.150
It's an unbelievably
significant lump.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.100
And the question is, how
did these lumps form?

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.370
Where did they come from?

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:32.110
We are confident that
these lumps evolved

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.090
from the very
minor perturbations

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.221
that we see in the
early universe,

00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:38.470
that we see most clearly
through the cosmic background

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.970
radiation.

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:44.060
The early universe we believe
was uniform in its mass density

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.960
to about one part in 100,000.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.237
But at the level of
one part in 100,000,

00:49:49.237 --> 00:49:51.320
we actually see in the
cosmic background radiation

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.790
that there are nonuniformities.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.580
And things like the
Earth form because

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:03.350
these small nonuniformities
in the mass density

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.660
are gravitationally unstable.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.330
In regions where there's
a slight excess of matter,

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.440
that excess of matter
produces a gravitational field

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.000
pulling more matter
into those regions,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.450
producing a still stronger
gravitational field pulling

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.200
in more matter.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.450
And the system is unstable,
and it forms complicated lumps

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.530
which are galaxies,
stars, planets, et cetera.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.020
And that's a complicated story.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:32.600
But it all starts from these
very faint nonuniformities that

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.275
existed, we believe,
shortly after the Big Bang.

00:50:35.275 --> 00:50:37.650
And we see these nonuniformities
in the cosmic background

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.970
radiation, and
measuring them tells us

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.950
a lot about the
conditions of the universe

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:45.630
then, and allows us
to build theories

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.090
of how the universe
got to be that way.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:52.240
And that's what these satellites
like COBE, WMAP, and Planck

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.840
are all about-- measuring
these nonuniformities

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.325
to rather
extraordinary accuracy.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.060
Inflation has an
answer to the riddle

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.831
of where the
nonuniformities came from.

00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:05.330
In the conventional
Big Bang theory,

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:06.880
there was really
just no explanation.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.340
People just assumed they were
there and put them in by hand,

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.890
but there was no theory of
what might have created them.

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.620
In the context of
inflationary models

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.920
where all the matter really is
being created by the inflation,

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.970
the nonuniformities are also
controlled by that inflation,

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:29.380
and where nonuniformities
come from is quantum effects.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.920
It's a little hard to believe
that quantum effects could

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:37.000
be important for the large
scale structure of the universe.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.134
The Andromeda
galaxy doesn't look

00:51:39.134 --> 00:51:40.550
like it's something
that should be

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:43.740
thought of as a
quantum fluctuation.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.600
But when one pursues this
theory quantitatively,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.600
it actually does work very well.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.440
The theory is that
the ripples that we

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.660
see in the cosmic
background radiation

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.060
really were purely the
consequence of quantum theory--

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.300
basically the uncertainty
principle of quantum theory,

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.580
which says that it's just
impossible to have something

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.190
that's completely uniform.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:11.124
It's not consistent with
the uncertainty principle.

00:52:11.124 --> 00:52:13.540
And when one puts in the basic
ideas of quantum mechanics,

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.170
we can actually calculate
properties of these ripples.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.420
It turns out that we
would need to know

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.195
more about the physics
of very high energy--

00:52:25.195 --> 00:52:27.920
the physics that was
relevant during the period

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.950
of inflation-- to
be able to predict

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.510
the actual amplitude
of these ripples.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.695
So we cannot predict
the amplitude.

00:52:34.695 --> 00:52:36.320
In principle, inflation
would allow you

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.110
to if you knew enough about the
underlying particle physics,

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.910
but we don't know that much.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.900
So in practice we cannot
predict the amplitude.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.140
But inflationary models
make a very clear prediction

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.060
for the spectrum of
these fluctuations.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.150
And by that I mean how
the intensity varies

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:53.550
with wavelength.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.410
So the spectrum really
means the same thing

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:56.720
as it would mean for
sound, except you

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.845
should think about wavelength
rather than frequency

00:52:58.845 --> 00:53:02.230
because these waves
don't really oscillate.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:04.830
But they do have wavelengths
just like sound waves have

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.090
wavelengths, and if you
talk about the intensity

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:09.150
versus wavelengths,
this idea of a spectrum

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:10.600
is really the same
as what you'll

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.830
be talking about with sound.

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:16.000
And you can measure it.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.780
This is not quite the
latest measurements,

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.120
but it's the latest measurements
that I have graphed.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.550
The red line is the
theoretical prediction.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.060
The black dots are
the measurements.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.275
This goes through the
seven year WMAP data.

00:53:29.275 --> 00:53:30.900
We have a little
Eureka guy to tell you

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.630
how happy I am about this curve.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:38.310
And I also have graphs of what
other ideas would predict.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.170
For a while, for example, people
took very seriously the idea

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:43.850
that the randomness that
we see in the universe--

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.870
these fluctuations--
may have been caused

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:47.400
by the random
formation of things

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.390
called cosmic strings
that would form

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.030
in phase transitions
in the early universe.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.370
That was certainly a
viable idea in its day,

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:55.753
but once this
curve got measured,

00:53:55.753 --> 00:53:57.586
the cosmic strings were
predicting something

00:53:57.586 --> 00:54:00.690
that looked like that, which is
nothing at all like that curve.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:03.780
And they have since
been therefore excluded

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:09.374
as being the source of density
fluctuations in the universe.

00:54:09.374 --> 00:54:11.040
And various other
models are shown here.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.220
I don't think I'll take the time
to go into, because there are

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.430
other things I
want to talk about.

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:18.140
But anyway, marvelous success.

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.570
This is actually
the latest data.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.480
This is the Planck data that
was released last March.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.970
I don't have it plotted
on the same scale,

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.010
but again you see
a theoretical curve

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:30.630
based on inflation
and dots that show

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.710
the data with little
tiny error bars.

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:35.930
But absolutely gorgeous fit.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:36.828
Yes.

00:54:36.828 --> 00:54:38.953
AUDIENCE: What happened to
your theory of inflation

00:54:38.953 --> 00:54:42.306
after they discovered
dark energy?

00:54:42.306 --> 00:54:43.810
Did it change significantly?

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:44.600
PROFESSOR: Did
the theory change?

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.306
AUDIENCE: Or like,
in the last graph

00:54:46.306 --> 00:54:48.234
there was a different curve.

00:54:50.367 --> 00:54:52.450
PROFESSOR: Well it's plotted
on a different scale,

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:56.220
but this actually is pretty much
the same curve as that curve.

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.220
Although you can't tell.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:57.886
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:54:57.886 --> 00:54:59.040
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.310
Oh, inflation without
dark energy, for example.

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:07.710
I think it's not so much
that the theory of inflation

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.490
changed between
these two curves,

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:11.730
but the curve you
actually see today

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.160
is the result of what things
looked like immediately

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.635
after inflation combined with
the evolution that took place

00:55:18.635 --> 00:55:19.144
since then.

00:55:19.144 --> 00:55:20.560
And it's really
the evolution that

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.740
took place since then that
makes a big difference

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.060
between this inflationary curve
and the other inflationary

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.540
curve.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.980
So inflation did not have
to change very much at all.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:33.132
It really did not.

00:55:33.132 --> 00:55:34.590
But of course it
looks a lot better

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:37.910
after dark energy was discovered
because the mass density came

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.520
out right, and gradually we
also got more and more data

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.900
about these fluctuations
which just fit beautifully

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.150
with what inflation predicts.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:48.980
OK.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:53.390
I want to now launch into
the idea of the multiverse.

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:56.170
And I guess I'll try to go
through this quickly so that we

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:56.750
can finish.

00:55:58.839 --> 00:56:00.880
We're not going try to
understand all the details

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.020
anyway, so I'll talk
about fewer of them

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.554
for the remaining 10
minutes of the class.

00:56:06.554 --> 00:56:08.720
But I'd like to say a little
bit about how inflation

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.950
leads to the idea
of a multiverse.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.491
Of course we'll come back to it
at the very end of the class,

00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:16.205
and it's certainly an exciting,
I think, aspect of inflation.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.700
The repulsive gravity material
that drives the inflation

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.520
is metastable, as we said.

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.420
So it decays.

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.610
And that means that if
you sit in one place

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:29.417
and ask where
inflation is happening,

00:56:29.417 --> 00:56:31.750
and ask what's the probability
that it's still happening

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.700
a little bit later,
that probability

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.970
decreases exponentially--
drops by a factor of two

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:40.300
every doubling, every half life.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:45.110
But at the same time, the volume
of any region that's inflating

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:50.410
is also growing exponentially,
growing due to the inflation.

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:54.310
And in fact in any
reasonable inflationary model

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:58.840
the growth rate is vastly
faster than the decay rate.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.530
So if you look at
the volume that's

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:05.660
inflating, if you
wait for a half life,

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.180
indeed half of that
volume will no longer

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.160
be inflating-- by the
definition of a half life.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.210
But the half that remains
will be vastly larger

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:14.590
than what you started with.

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.110
That's the catch.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:17.920
And that's a very
peculiar situation

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.880
because it doesn't
seem to show any end.

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.870
The volume that's inflating
just gets bigger and bigger

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:28.270
even while it's decaying,
because the expansion is faster

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:30.090
than the decay.

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:34.230
And that's what leads to this
phenomena of eternal inflation.

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.490
The volume that is inflating
increases with time,

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:40.760
even though the inflating
material is decaying.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.260
And that leads to what we
call eternal inflation.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.500
The word "eternal" is
being used slightly loosely

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.099
because eternal
really means forever.

00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:51.390
This is forever into the
future, as far as we can tell,

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:53.550
but it's not forever
into the past.

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:56.290
Inflation would still start
at some finite time here,

00:57:56.290 --> 00:58:00.180
but then once it starts,
it goes on forever.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:05.060
And whenever a piece of
this inflating region

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.360
undergoes a transition
and becomes normal,

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.530
that locally looks
like a Big Bang.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:13.430
And our Big Bang would be
one of these local events,

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:17.810
and the universe formed by
any one of these local events

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:21.270
where the inflating
region decays

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.207
would be called a
pocket universe.

00:58:23.207 --> 00:58:25.290
Pocket just to suggest
that there are many of them

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.220
in the overall scale
of this multiverse.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.230
They are in some sense
small, even though they'd

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.100
be as big as the
universe that we live in.

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:35.710
And our universe would be one
of these pocket universes.

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:37.480
So instead of one
universe, inflation

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.650
produces an infinite
number, which

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:42.257
is what we call multiverse.

00:58:42.257 --> 00:58:44.090
I might just say the
word multiverse is also

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:47.220
used in other contexts
and another theories,

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:50.170
but inflation, I think, is
probably the most plausible way

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:52.190
of getting a
multiverse, and it's

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:53.720
what most cosmologists
are talking

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.520
about when they talk
about a multiverse.

00:58:59.310 --> 00:58:59.810
OK.

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:03.460
Now how does dark
energy fit in here?

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:07.120
It plays a very important
role in our understanding.

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.080
To review, in 1998
several groups--

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.740
two groups of astronomers
discovered independently

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:17.180
that the universe
is now accelerating,

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.360
and our understanding
is that the universe has

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:23.230
been accelerating for about
the last five billion years

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:26.800
out of the 14 billion year
history of the universe.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.830
There was a period where
it was decelerating

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:31.819
until five billion years ago.

00:59:31.819 --> 00:59:33.860
An implication of this is
that inflation actually

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.860
is happening today.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.840
This acceleration of
the universe that we see

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.880
is very much like inflation,
and we really interpret it

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.360
according to similar
kind of physics.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.670
We think it has to be
caused by some kind

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:46.760
of a negative pressure,
just as inflation

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.770
was caused by a
negative pressure.

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:55.970
And this material that
apparently fills space and has

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:58.737
negative pressure is
what we call dark energy.

00:59:58.737 --> 01:00:00.570
And dark energy is
really just by definition

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:02.770
the stuff, whatever
it is, that's

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:05.980
causing this acceleration.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.650
If we ask, what is the
dark energy, really?

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.170
I think everybody agrees there's
a definite answer to that,

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:14.740
which is something
like, who knows?

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.430
But there's also a most
plausible candidate,

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:19.390
even though we don't know.

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:21.730
The most plausible candidate--
and other candidates

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.915
are not that different,
really, but we'll

01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:26.290
talk about the most plausible
candidate-- which is simply

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.850
that dark energy
is vacuum energy.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.130
The energy of nothingness.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:34.970
Now it may be surprising that
nothingness can have energy.

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.700
But I'll talk about that, and
it's really not so surprising.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.840
I'll come back to that question.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.197
But if dark energy is really
just the energy of the vacuum,

01:00:43.197 --> 01:00:45.030
that's completely
consistent with everything

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:47.960
we know about, what we can
measure, the expansion pattern

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.011
of the universe.

01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:49.510
Yes.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:52.378
AUDIENCE: Why is it that only
in the last five billion years

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:54.585
has the universe
started accelerating?

01:00:54.585 --> 01:00:55.960
PROFESSOR: To
start accelerating.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.380
Right.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:56.910
Right.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:57.360
OK.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.490
I'm now in a
position to say that.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.500
I wasn't quite when I
made the first statement,

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.190
but now that I've said there's
probably vacuum energy,

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:05.350
I can give you an answer.

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.880
Which is that vacuum
energy, because it is just

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.859
the energy of the vacuum,
does not change with time.

01:01:10.859 --> 01:01:13.150
And that's the same as what
I told you about the energy

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.360
density during inflation.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.030
It's just a constant.

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.970
At the same time,
ordinary matter

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:21.140
thins out as the universe
expands, throwing off

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.130
in density like one over
the cube of the volume.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.580
So what happened was
that the universe

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.630
was dominated by ordinary
matter until about five

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:32.680
billion years ago, which
produced attractive gravity

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.230
and caused the universe to slow.

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.680
But then about five
billion years ago

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.460
the universe thinned out enough
so that the ordinary matter

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.980
no longer dominated over
the vacuum energy, and then

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.090
the vacuum energy started
causing repulsion.

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:51.290
Vacuum energy was there all
along causing repulsion,

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.830
but it was overwhelmed
by the attractive gravity

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:57.660
of the ordinary matter until
about five billion years ago.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.807
Does that make sense?

01:01:58.807 --> 01:01:59.390
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:00.372
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:02:00.372 --> 01:02:01.052
Good.

01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:01.885
Any other questions?

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.070
OK.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:06.652
So.

01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:08.360
The first thing I want
to talk about here

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.430
is why can nothing
weigh something?

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.470
Why can nothing have energy?

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:14.970
And the answer is
that actually this

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.920
is something the physicists
are pretty clear on these days.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.250
The quantum vacuum, unlike
the classical vacuum,

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:23.480
is a very complicated state.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.170
It's not really empty at all.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:31.572
It really is a complicated
jumble of vacuum fluctuations.

01:02:31.572 --> 01:02:34.030
We think there's even a field
called the Higgs field, which

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:35.488
you've probably
heard of, which has

01:02:35.488 --> 01:02:38.970
a nonzero value in
the vacuum on average.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.835
Things like the photon field,
the electromagnetic field,

01:02:41.835 --> 01:02:44.230
is constantly oscillating
in the vacuum because

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.170
of the uncertainty
principle, basically,

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.771
resulting in energy density
in those fluctuations.

01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:51.520
So there's no reason
for the vacuum energy

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.160
to be zero, as far
as we can tell.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.990
But that doesn't mean that
we understand its value.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:59.820
The real problem from the point
of view of fundamental physics

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.540
today is not understanding
why the vacuum might

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.200
have a nonzero energy density.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.230
The problem is understanding
basically why it's so small.

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:11.440
And why is smallness a problem?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.730
If you look at quantum field
theory-- which we're not

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:16.060
going to learn in any detail--
but quantum field theory

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.720
says that, for example,
the electromagnetic field

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.090
is constantly fluctuating.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:24.290
Guaranteed so by the
uncertainty principle.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:27.510
And these fluctuations
can have all wavelengths.

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:30.810
And every wavelength contributes
to the energy density

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.990
of the vacuum fluctuations.

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:34.930
And there is no
shortest wavelength.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:36.950
There's a longest
wavelength in any size box,

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.370
but there's no
shortest wavelength.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.370
So in fact, when you try
to calculate the energy

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.700
density of the vacuum in
the quantum field theory,

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.692
it diverges on the
short wavelength side.

01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:49.275
It becomes literally infinite
as far as the formal calculation

01:03:49.275 --> 01:03:51.895
is concerned because all
wavelengths contribute,

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:55.320
and there is no
shortest wavelength.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:01.640
So what does this mean
about the real physics?

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.450
We think it's not necessarily a
problem with our understanding

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:06.570
of quantum field theory.

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.940
It really is, we think,
just a limitation

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:13.280
of the range of validity
of those assumptions.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.076
They certainly-- quantum theory
works extraordinarily well

01:04:16.076 --> 01:04:20.780
when it's tested in
laboratory circumstances.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.580
So we think that at
very short wavelengths,

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.490
something must happen to
cut off this infinity.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.060
And a good candidate for what
happens at short wavelengths

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.340
to cut off the
infinity is the effects

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.050
of quantum gravity, which
we don't understand.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:39.750
So one way of estimating
the true energy density

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.880
as predicted by
quantum field theory

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.490
is to cut things off at the
Planck scale, the energy scale,

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.970
length scale, associated
with quantum gravity-- which

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:50.611
is about 10 to the
minus 33 centimeters.

01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:52.610
And if you do that, you
can calculate the number

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.110
for the energy density of
the electromagnetic field

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.280
of the vacuum and
get a finite number.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.940
But it's too large.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.040
And too large not by a
little bit, but by a lot.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.800
It's too large by 120
orders of magnitude.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.450
So we are way off in terms of
understanding why the vacuum

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:18.430
energy is what it is since our
naive estimates say it should

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:21.570
be maybe 120 orders
of magnitude larger.

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:26.870
Now I should add that there
is still a way out here.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.520
The energy that
we calculate here

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.530
is one contribution to
the total vacuum energy.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:33.730
There are negative
contributions as well.

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.270
If you calculate the
fluctuations of the electron

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:38.880
field, that turns out to be
negative in its contribution

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.350
to the energy.

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:43.050
And it's always possible
that these numbers cancel--

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:47.810
or cancel almost exactly-- but
we don't know why they should.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:50.810
So basically there's a big
question mark theoretically

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:54.770
on what we would predict for the
energy density of the vacuum.

01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:57.850
Let's see.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.090
What should I do here?

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:03.147
I am not going to be able
to finish this lecture.

01:06:03.147 --> 01:06:04.730
I think it's worth
finishing, however.

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:07.850
So I think what I'll do is I'll
maybe go through this slide

01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:11.680
and then we'll just stop, and
we'll pick up again next time.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.010
There are just a few
more slides to show.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:17.230
But I think it's an interesting
story worth finishing.

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:19.160
But to come to a good
stopping place here--

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.760
we still have a minute
and a half, I think.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.790
I want to say a little bit about
the landscape of string theory,

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.510
which is going to be a possible
explanation-- only possible,

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:32.440
it's very speculative here-- but
one possible explanation which

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.780
combines inflation, the eternal
inflation, and string theory

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:40.050
produces a possible explanation
for this very small vacuum

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.460
energy that we observe.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.050
It's based on the idea
that string theory does not

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:47.330
have the unique vacuum.

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:51.030
For many years string
theorists sought

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:54.984
to find the vacuum of string
theory with no success.

01:06:54.984 --> 01:06:56.400
They just couldn't
figure out what

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.670
the vacuum of string
theory would look like.

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:02.440
And then a little more than 10
years ago many string theorists

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.550
began to converge
around the idea

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:07.150
that maybe they could not
find a vacuum because there

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:10.000
is no unique vacuum
to string theory.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.520
Instead, what they now
claim is that there's

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.660
a colossal number-- they
bandy around numbers like 10

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:25.050
to the 500th power-- a colossal
number of metastable states,

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:28.410
which are long lived,
any one of which

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:32.000
could look like a vacuum
for a long period of time,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.110
even though ultimately it
might decay or tunnel into one

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:38.710
of the other metastable states.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.790
So this is called the
landscape of string theory.

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:45.250
This huge set of
vacuum like states,

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.202
any one of which could be
the vacuum that fills a given

01:07:49.202 --> 01:07:50.410
pocket universe, for example.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.920
When one combines this with
the idea of eternal inflation,

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.320
then one reaches the conclusion
that eternal inflation

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.240
would very likely
populate all of these 10

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.590
to the 500 or more vacua.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:08.680
That is, different
pocket universes

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.340
would have different kinds
of vacuum inside them, which

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.270
would be determined randomly as
the pocket universes nucleate,

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:19.200
as they break off from
this inflating backbone.

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:23.479
And then we would
have a multiverse

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:26.287
which would consist
of many, many-- 10

01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:29.069
to the 500 or more--
different kinds of vacua

01:08:29.069 --> 01:08:30.535
in different pocket universes.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.500
Under this assumption,
ultimately string theory

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.689
would be the assumed
laws of physics

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:41.500
that would govern everything.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.979
But if you were living in one
of these pocket universes,

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:48.170
you actually see apparent laws
of physics that would look very

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:51.029
different from other
pocket universe's.

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:53.229
The point is that the
physics that we actually

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:56.979
see and measure is low energy
physics compared to the energy

01:08:56.979 --> 01:09:00.130
scales of the string theory.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:04.930
So what we are seeing are
just small fluctuations

01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:07.330
in the ultimate scheme of
things about the vacuum

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.670
that we live in.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:12.660
So the very particle
spectrum that we see,

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.310
the fact that we see
electrons and quarks, quarks

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:19.310
that combine to form
protons and neutrons--

01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:22.037
could be peculiar to
our particular pocket.

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:24.620
And in other pockets there could
be completely different kinds

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.100
of particles, which
are just oscillations

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.979
about different kinds of vacuum.

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:31.819
So even though the
laws of physics

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:34.340
would in principle be
the same everywhere--

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.765
the laws of string
theory-- in practice the

01:09:36.765 --> 01:09:38.140
observed laws of
physics would be

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.555
very different from
one pocket to another.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:41.930
And in particular
since there are

01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:44.319
different vacua in
the different pockets,

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.520
the vacuum energy
density would be

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.510
different in different pockets.

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:53.420
And that variability of
the vacuum energy density

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.220
provides a possible answer to
why we see such a small vacuum

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:57.970
energy.

01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:01.610
And we'll talk more about
that next time on Tuesday.

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.280
See you then.

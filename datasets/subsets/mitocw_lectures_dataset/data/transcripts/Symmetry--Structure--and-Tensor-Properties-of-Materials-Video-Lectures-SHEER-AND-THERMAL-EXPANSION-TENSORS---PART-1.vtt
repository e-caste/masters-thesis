WEBVTT

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.500
PROFESSOR: I think you
will get going.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.600
A lot of people are not here,
but I think if the MRS meeting

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.490
were going on across the river
I would be there too if I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.120
didn't have a class to go to.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.560
We had last time finished
a discussion strain.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.910
And we introduced strain by
defining it as a displacement,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.170
each component of a vector
displacement U as being given

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.520
by a set of coefficients, eij
times x of j, which says that

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.000
the displacement in a deformed
body varies linearly with the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.170
position of the particular
point in the body.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.360
We could also express the
same thing in terms

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.330
of change of length.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.790
The change in the vector U would
be given by-- we show

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.320
the same set of coefficients--

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.150
eij times delta x of j.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.350
So whether you want the
displacement vector or you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.450
want the fractional change of
length, you get this by an

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.680
expression of the same sort.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.540
We saw though that unless we
define the coefficients

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.800
correctly we could have a
situation where a body is not

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.900
only deformed but is
rotated as well.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.020
And we saw that in general
unless we define these

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.420
coefficients carefully we would
include in this tensor a

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.740
component of pure rotation,
rigid body rotation.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.070
And this would not measure
deformation.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.470
However, regardless of its
suitability or unsuitability,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.060
the positional vector
is a vector.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.280
It transforms like a vector.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.660
The displacement U is a vector,
and it will transform

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.810
like a vector; ergo, the 3 by
3 array eij is a second-rank

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.140
tensor and we'll transform
like a tensor.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.310
We showed though that we could
take eij and get rid of the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.000
pure rotation that might
be contained in those

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.840
coefficients by writing it as
a tensor epsilon ij plus

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.210
another tensor omega ij.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.890
And that was a new wrinkle,
the concept of adding two

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.460
tensors together to get
a third tensor.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.980
We did run into that before.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.500
And we define the elements of
the two tensors epsilon and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:00.580
omega; epsilon ij was given by
one half of eij plus eji, and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.750
omega ij is given by one
half of omega ij.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.810
And notice the order of the
subscripts here in this

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.420
difference.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.580
That is a matter of definition,
but it defines

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.250
which term is omega ij
and which is omega

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.670
ji minus omega ji.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.590
I'm sorry.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.970
This should be eij minus eji.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.430
And we showed that at a tensor
of this form which would have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:50.220
all of the diagonal terms zero
and the off-diagonal terms

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.540
equal to the negative of one
another that a tensor of this

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:07.210
form does indeed correspond
to pure body rotation.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.230
We showed that by looking at
a point at the end of a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.320
positional vector U and looked
at a displacement which would

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.610
be exactly at right
angles to it.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:28.030
And the U would be given
by the tensor relation.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.070
We showed that U dot r is
identically zero when the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.940
displacement vector is given by
this tensor with diagonal

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.080
term zero and the off-diagonal
terms equal to the negative of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.540
one another.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.170
So we have then from a general
tensor of the form eij

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.080
constructed in the terms epsilon
ij something that is a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.230
measure of true deformation.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.750
It is a symmetric tensor
by definition.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.950
And therefore in addition to all
of the other properties of

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.770
second-rank tensor, namely
having a law of transformation

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.140
and staying symmetric for any
arbitrary change of coordinate

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:28.480
systems, the radius normal
property also works.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.670
Hence, the representation
surface that we construct from

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:40.980
the tensor epsilon ij xi
xj equals 1, gives

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.345
us the strain quadric.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.906
And it has the property that the
radius gives us the value

00:05:53.906 --> 00:06:01.825
of strain in a given
direction.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.430
And the value of the radius
literally is going to be the

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.390
vector that's on the left hand
side, the magnitude of U times

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.500
the component of U that is
parallel to the radial vector

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.300
per unit radial vector.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.170
And this then is the tensile
strain, the fractional change

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.050
of length as we look
in this direction.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.530
The radius normal is going to
give us the direction of the

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.780
total displacement U. And the
value of the property in that

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.490
direction is going to be the
product of that displacement

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.940
with a unit vector in the
direction of interest.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.850
And therefore that is the
tensile strain as we said

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.220
before from the general
properties of the quadric.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.600
So everything we said about
second-rank tensor and in

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.920
particular symmetric tensor
holds for the strain tensor.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:31.990
We can talk about diagonalizing
the strain

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.290
tensor into a form epsilon 1,
1, epsilon 22, zero zero,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.920
epsilon 33.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.950
And I'll remind you that we know
how to do this to set up

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.120
the normal equations and solve
for the eigenvalues and then

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.100
look for the principal
axes of a tensor.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.180
There are special forms
of the strain tensor.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.890
Something that 1 diagonal
goes into this form is

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.245
called plane strain.

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:09.610
And I love the melodic nature
of that, the plane strain.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.640
If this were strain induced by
a Modernistic transformation,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.990
we could call it the
Bain plane strain.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.120
If we diagonalized it,
it would be the

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.830
main Bain plane strains.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.150
And if that deformation took
place in an aircraft window,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.740
we could call it the plane-pane
main Bain strains.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.630
And we could continue on
indefinitely, but I think

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.270
you're finding this tiresome.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.590
Another form of the strain
tensor that doesn't look what

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.190
it actually represents is
epsilon 1 zero minus epsilon 1

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.170
zero zero zero zero.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.990
That looks peculiar,
very special.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.870
But, again, this is analogous
to what we found for stress.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:08.860
If we rotate this tensor 45
degrees, we would find that

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.070
treat tensor was diagonally,
had all the

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.700
diagonal elements zero.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:21.600
And we would have the
epsilon 11 prime--

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.940
let's just call it
epsilon prime--

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.940
and this epsilon prime
zero zero zero.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:36.100
And this is pure shear

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:42.000
Something that we'll show
shortly, and in fact I left it

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.680
to you as a problem
on a problems set.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.910
The sum of the diagonal
elements, epsilon 11 plus

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:57.070
epsilon 22 plus epsilon 33 is
something that's defined as

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.550
the trace of the tensor.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:09.950
And for the strain tensor, the
trace turns out to be equal to

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.730
delta V over the fractional
change in volume.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.070
And we'll show that in just
a little bit as well.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:23.960
So a characteristic of pure
shear is that it does not

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.660
result in any change of
volume of the solid.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.710
There's deformation, but the
volume stays exactly the same.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.370
Let me then proceed to show that
the trace of the strain

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.180
tensor is indeed the
change in volume.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:19.530
And want I'll do is to look at
an element of volume that is

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.810
oriented along the principal
elements of strain.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:30.970
So if this as x1, this is x2,
and this is x3, the strain

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.690
tensor I'll assume
is oriented.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.716
So we have a term epsilon 11
zero zero zero zero; epsilon

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:42.560
22 zero zero zero; epsilon 33.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:50.500
So let's suppose that the solid
originally has edges L1,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.590
L2, and L3 along x1, x2,
and x3, respectively.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.040
So the initial volume before any
deformation will be simply

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.020
L1 times L2 times L3.

00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:10.260
Let's suppose now we impose
the strain, and the volume

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.090
then we'll increase to some
value of V plus delta V. And

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.270
the length L1 will change
to a value L1 times 1

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.870
plus epsilon 11.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.480
That is to say it'll be L1
plus epsilon 11 times L1,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.000
which can be factored
out in this fashion.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.240
L2 changes to L2 times
1 plus epsilon 22.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:41.660
And L3 changes to L3 plus
epsilon 33 times L3, which

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.250
I'll write in this fashion.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:50.480
So expanding this product,
it'll be L1, L2, L3.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.930
And then if I simply multiply
out these terms, I'll have 1,

00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:02.650
and then I'll have epsilon 11
plus epsilon 22 plus epsilon

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.140
11 times epsilon 22.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.370
And this will be times
1 plus epsilon 33.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.330
And if I carry out that
multiplication,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.140
that will be 1 plus--

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:25.470
and I'll get exactly these terms
again-- epsilon 11 plus

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:34.110
epsilon 22 plus epsilon
11 times epsilon 22.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:41.700
And then a term epsilon 33 plus
epsilon 11 epsilon 33

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.440
plus epsilon 22 times
epsilon 33.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.685
And then a third-order term,
epsilon 11 times epsilon 22

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:54.860
times epsilon 33.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.360
Now having gone through the
painful process of expanding

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.160
that, I will proceed to say that
the epsilons are always

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.470
going to be very small.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.180
Elastic strains are typically
on the order of 10

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.780
to the minus 6.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.020
So a product of two of those
strains is 10 to the minus 12.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.360
And a product of three of those
terms is going to be on

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.260
the order of 10 to
the minus 18.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.770
So this last term is going
to be minuscule.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:30.120
And now I use a higher order
term intentionally rather than

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.140
a higher rank term.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.250
This is really a term
of higher order.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.170
The same is true of all the
peer-wise projects of this

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.180
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.850
So I now have left if I turn out
these higher order terms

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:49.430
to pasture, I'll have 1 plus
epsilon 11 plus epsilon 22

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.260
plus epsilon 33.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.210
And the rest is negligible.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:15:01.260
And this will be the original
volume V times 1 plus epsilon

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:07.020
11 plus epsilon 22
plus epsilon 33.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.390
So delta V over V, if I subtract
off V on the left,

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.360
delta V over V then is simply
going to be equal to epsilon

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.600
11 plus epsilon 22
plus epsilon 33.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.690
So this is indeed the fractional
change of volume,

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.095
and it's the trace
of epsilon ij.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.090
Now, physically, you wouldn't
expect the volume to change if

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.360
I change my reference
axes because

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.410
that's a scalar quantity.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:49.000
So I've shown by a hand-waving,
backdoor argument

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.880
that in fact the trace of a
tensor does stay invariant for

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.690
at least this particular
tensor.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.220
But it's fairly straightforward
to show that

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.890
for any tensor aij the trace
of the tensor is invariant

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.830
when you change the
coordinate system.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.260
And that's not hard to do.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.440
If you're clever, it takes
about three lines.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.910
So I'll invite you to the
exhilaration of discovering

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.807
that for yourself on
a problem set.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.080
Any questions or comments?

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.680
All right.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:45.030
Having defined strain as a
symmetric second-rank tensor

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:56.740
when we factor out rigid body
rotation, we can view strain

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.730
as a physical property.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.230
And I think I tried to hoodwink
you last time by

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:10.530
saying this is a property
of material.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.339
So therefore strain tensor has
to also conform to all of the

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.490
symmetry restrains that
we have derived very

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.839
exhaustively.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.839
And you said, no, no, no, no,
that can't be; I don't believe

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:29.810
that I can only give a uniform
uniaxial deformation to an

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.920
orthorhombic crystal.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.190
And I say, yeah, but to get the
deformation, you have to

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.410
squeeze the crystal.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.080
And that is going to be linked
to the deformation by the

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.400
elastic constants, and they
are physical properties.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.510
And that maybe makes you
think a little bit.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.520
But actually even though
operationally you impose a

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.600
strain by imposing a stress or
by doing something else to the

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.490
crystal that results in a
strain, you can nevertheless

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.060
pick any stimulus you
wish to achieve a

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.910
desired state of strain.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.400
So there is no symmetry
constraint on the form of the

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.690
strain tensor that can result.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.560
So the stain tensor then is
not a property tensor.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.990
It is also a field tensor
just like stress.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.600
So it can have any form we
choose to create in it.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:28.080
So we now have the potential
of having

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.770
stress as a field tensor.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.710
And we have strain as
a field tensor.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.540
And within limits, we can create
strains of these two

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.750
field tensors of any
form that we wish.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.600
And we can now regard these as
things that we do to crystals

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.500
and look at a whole range of
properties that result when

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:09.510
the generalized force is not
a vector, a tensor of first

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.170
rank, but the generalized
force is a--

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.300
let's say-- a stress tensor.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.320
It's a generalized force
which itself is not

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.950
a first rank tensor.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.460
It's a second rank tensor.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.530
So we'll see a whole collection
of interesting

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.850
properties that fall
into this category.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.620
But first I'd like to look at
one remaining second-rank

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.860
tensor property, and that
is thermal expansion.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.360
And this is a curious
second-rank tensor property,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.480
and we couldn't discuss
it until we had

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.800
talked about strain.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.390
And let me introduce it by
one-dimensional example.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:20:02.020
Let's suppose we have a rodlike
specimen of length L.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.850
And let's suppose it is
in equilibrium at some

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.850
temperature T. And then we heat
it up to some temperature

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.910
T plus delta T.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.430
In response to that particular
change in temperature, the

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:25.743
length of the rod will increase
to a length L plus

00:20:25.743 --> 00:20:28.710
delta L. It expands.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.390
And we would find experimentally
that delta L,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.680
first of all, is proportional
to L. If you make the rod

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.010
twice as long, the amount of
expansion in an absolute sense

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.810
is twice as large.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:48.110
And secondly, provided you're
well above very, very low

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.210
temperatures, close to absolute
zero, delta L will

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.935
also be proportional to the
change in temperature.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.200
Thermal expansion is one of
those properties which

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.600
thermodynamically must
go to zero as

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.330
temperature goes to zero.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.740
So the thermal expansion
coefficient that we've yet to

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.450
define will be a function of
temperature as we get down to

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.400
very low temperatures on the
order of a few degrees Kelvin.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.140
So we can define then the
linear thermal expansion

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:37.570
coefficient for this rod as 1
over L, delta L over delta T.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:43.180
So this is something that will
give us the fractional change

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.470
of lengths.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:53.410
And what we can do now in
general is to say that if we

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.140
create a general strain, not
a tensile strain, we have a

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:06.580
general strain epsilon 11 plus
epsilon 12, epsilon 13, and so

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.740
on, has to be symmetric.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.840
So epsilon 21 is equal
to epsilon 12.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:28.690
We'll say that this tensor
epsilon ij will be written in

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:34.140
general for the
three-dimensional case as a

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:45.850
second-rank tensor aij times
a scalar quantity delta T.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.700
The strain is the
field tensor.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.980
That's the response.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.460
The stimulus that creates this
response is an incremental

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.930
change in temperature.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:59.380
But as this is a second-rank
tensor and this is a scalar,

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.370
an array of coefficients in
which we multiply every

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.200
element of a tensor by a scalar
is also a tensor.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.950
So this is called the
linear thermal

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.530
expansion coefficient tensor.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:36.100
And it is a symmetric tensor by
definition since a measure

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:42.160
of true strain is by definition
a symmetric tensor.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.490
So this is the linear thermal
expansion coefficient tensor.

00:23:53.346 --> 00:23:54.645
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:23:54.645 --> 00:23:55.346
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:55.346 --> 00:23:58.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
temperature gradient

00:23:58.068 --> 00:23:58.791
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:00.960
and talk about the
directionality say between

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.350
here and here because of the
temperature [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.180
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.310
Sure.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.470
Sure if you wanted to do that.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.210
That assumes that the thermal
conductivity would be very

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.560
small so that the temperature
inside the body would not

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.130
attempt to [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.606
Yeah.

00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:18.082
Yeah.

00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:20.840
In the same way that you could
create strains that are in

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.090
homogeneous as well.

00:24:31.935 --> 00:24:34.640
We'll now for the first time
start talking not in terms of

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.590
abstractions but in terms of
some real physical properties.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.140
What is the range of
linear thermal

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.780
expansion coefficient tensors?

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.380
And unlike many physical
properties, that's an easy one

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:58.350
to answer, 10 to the minus
6 degree C per degree C.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.290
Materials have a very, very
small range linear thermal

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.510
expansion coefficients.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.910
And let me give you some
examples for real materials.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:12.930
They go up to maybe 10 to the
minus 5 for a very soft weakly

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.460
bonded materials.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.630
But the for metals--

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.450
and I'm giving you a single
number now because these are

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.530
averages for polycrystalline
materials--

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.150
the value of A times
10 to the 6.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:37.240
For lead, a low- melting metal,
is 28, 2.8 times 10 to

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.480
the minus 5.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.560
For copper, 18.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.350
For iron, 12.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.500
Four tungsten, a very
refractory metal, 5.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.810
And for diamond, a very strongly
bonded materials,

00:25:54.810 --> 00:26:04.810
it's 0.89 times 10 minus 6.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:22.720
If we look at compounds, again,
the average linear

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.180
thermal expansion coefficient
times 10 to the 6 for

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.050
polycrystalline material.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:34.930
For aluminum bromide, hardly
a technology material of

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.370
commerce, but in light of this
because this has one of the

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.590
largest linear thermal expansion
coefficients of any

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.250
material, very weakly
bonded to compound.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:53.600
For a more typical ionic
compound, NaCL, 40 times 10 to

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.530
the minus 6.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:02.200
For calcium fluoride, this has
a bivalent cation in it, so

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.750
the material is stronger, more
strongly bonded, 20.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:12.860
For MgO, both a divalent cation
and the divalent anion,

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.580
as you would expect, the thermal
expansion coefficient

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.250
drop still more.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:23.990
For Al2O3, a trivalent cation
that goes down to 8.8, and

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.840
that's really an average
because this

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.720
is a hexagonal material.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:33.670
And a second-rank property
tensor for a hexagonal crystal

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:39.380
has to have two equal diagonal
elements and one independent

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.695
diagonal element when you
diagonalize the tensor.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:54.870
Spinal, MgAl2O4 this is
representative of all of the

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.350
ferrites for example, 7.6.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.550
Silicon carbide, a
very refractory

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:07.635
covalent compound, 4.7.

00:28:07.635 --> 00:28:12.980
For glasses, here's
a surprise.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.120
You might think that a glass
might have about the same

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.010
linear expansion coefficient as
the crystalline form of the

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.610
same composition.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:30.520
But a sodium calcium silicon
oxide glass, so called

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.840
soda-lime silicate glass,
is 9, fairly low.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:44.640
A borosilicate glass, like the
Vicor that we love to make

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.620
glass apparatus out of, 4.5.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:56.210
And one of the near record
holder is fused silica,

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:01.920
silicio glass, and here
a measly value of 0.5.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.630
So glasses have very low linear
thermal expansion

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.970
coefficients compared to
crystallize materials that are

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.790
predominantly ionic.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.830
And the reason lies in the
nature of the structure.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.790
Something like MgO has ordered
ions, and when you heat it up,

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.280
it expands isotropically.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.770
A glass is this random network
of edge-shared polyhedra.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.210
So when you heat it up, yes,
the dimensions of the

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.290
polyhedra increase in proportion
to the change of

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.150
temperature.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.450
But the framework because it's
so meandering and open can

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.080
buckle to accommodate the
increased size of the

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.240
tetrahedra that are
in the linkage.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.060
So the result is the network
buckles, but the overall

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:52.050
microscopic thermal expansion
is very, very slight even

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.030
though the tetrahedra are
changing dimensions in the

00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:00.190
same degree that they are in
these crystalline inorganic

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.440
nonmetallic materials.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.360
Let me give you a handout not
that it's up to date, but

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.030
there was a very nice,
convenient one-page article in

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.610
the Journal of the American
Ceramic Society a number of

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.330
years ago that lists thermal
expansion coefficients for low

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.650
expansion oxides.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.260
So let me pass that around
and let you take off

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.460
for copy with that.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.975
And that gives some examples of
the value of this property

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:35.450
for, again, for polycrystalline
materials,

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.130
which if you looked at a single
crystal would show

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.350
anisotropy.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.100
And here you'll find a few
materials in the list near the

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.470
top they're arranged in order
of increasing linear thermal

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:53.090
expansion, you'll find some that
are just about zero when

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.830
you have a polycrystalline
form of the material.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:01.160
And you'll have some that have
this very unusual behavior

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.920
where the linear thermal
expansion coefficient is

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.200
actually negative.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.950
So let me pass this around
for reference.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:17.980
Now this may seem to be a
curiosity that you can fine

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.330
for a polycrystalline material
for which the individual

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:27.410
grains expand anisotropically
a bulk linear thermal

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.290
expansion coefficient of zero.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.920
Why should one care other than
that being a curious result?

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.170
Can anybody guess?

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:40.700
AUDIENCE: Can you
say that again?

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.090
PROFESSOR: That these are
materials which in a

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.650
polycrystalline form with random
grain orientation have

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.840
a linear thermal expansion
coefficient this is

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.090
essentially zero?

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.380
Exactly.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:07.120
The materials out of which you
build furnace linings and

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.110
tanks for melting glass or
smelting steel have to be made

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.690
out of polycrystalline
materials.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.680
You can't have a monolithic
single crystal that's large

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.330
enough to melt a significant
amount of

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.070
glass in for example.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:23.110
And being polycrystalline, when
the material expands,

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.820
there is a great deal of stress
between neighboring

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.530
grains because they're
randomly oriented.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.400
If the bulk microscopic thermal
expansion coefficient

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.760
is zero, that is going to be
refractory that is very, very

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.630
resistant to thermal shock.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.430
When you heat it up, you don't
find intergranular cracking.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:55.040
So the materials that have
essentially zero spatially

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.910
average thermal expansion
coefficients are very

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.620
attractive for refractories.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.260
You can pick up any issue
of the Journal of

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.580
the American Ceramics--

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.360
not the journal, but the
Bulletin of the American

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.120
Ceramic Society and you will
find refractory companies

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.700
hustling materials like
Cordierite, which is a

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.710
silicate material that on
average has one positive

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.490
thermal expansion coefficient,
one negative thermal expansion

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.350
coefficient.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.810
And the volume change of the
individual grains is

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.380
essentially zero.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:36.385
So that makes a dandy material
for refractories.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:47.210
Cordierite has another
interesting property that is a

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.825
really nice example
of anisotropy

00:33:49.825 --> 00:33:53.340
of a physical property.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.995
If I ask you to rattle off some
properties which you know

00:33:55.995 --> 00:33:59.230
to be very anisotropic, one of
them that you wouldn't think

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.600
of is color.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.470
Your t-shirt is pink,
so how can that be

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:06.790
a function of direction?

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.460
Well your t-shirt is not
a single crystal.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.920
And their single crystals which
if you hold them up to

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.760
light and pass through a plain
polarized beam of light the

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.210
crystal has a very different
color for one direction of

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.360
polarization then another.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.580
And these colors, interestingly,
very often are

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.630
strikingly different.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.690
They're crystals that are green
in light polarized in

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:36.670
one direction and red for
light polarized in the

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.679
opposite direction.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:44.969
And there is in the old
Icelandic sagas--

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.310
few people have heard of them.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:52.460
The Icelandic sagas which were
written in about the year 500

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.550
are one of the early forms of
Western literature that is

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.730
really great, enduring
world-class literature.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:05.310
In the sagas, there's one
episode where Thor is sleeping

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:09.820
and Olaf comes along and
steals his sunstone.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.690
And Thor is upset he takes
his battle as and cut

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.880
Olaf's head in twain.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.240
And people puzzled
for hundreds of

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.010
years, what is sunstone.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.080
This doesn't compute
in today's age.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.950
And finally a Norwegian
archaeologist came up with a

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:36.240
hypothesis that in Iceland there
are remarkably large and

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.920
remarkably transparent and
perfect single crystals of

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.420
Cordierite.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.920
And Cordierite is strikingly
pleochroic.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.800
That's color that is a function
of direction.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.770
And what this archaeologist
theorized is that the Vikings

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:59.670
would take a sunstone when they
went sailing on the North

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:04.120
Sea, which is notoriously damp
and overcast and gray, and

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.050
your principal means of
navigation was the sun.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.890
But when the sky was overcast,
you couldn't see the sun.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.290
But the sun as it comes through
the cloud gives you

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.890
light that's very strongly
polarized.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.460
So the theory is that the
Vikings would have very

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.560
perfect crystals of transparent
Cordierite, would

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.340
hold them up to the sky, and
turn them around until the

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:33.100
Cordierite crystal lit up a
bright, golden sunny yellow.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.020
What better name for
the sunstone.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.310
You found the sun from the
direction of polarization of

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.950
the light scattered from the
cloud when you've got the

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.800
crystal oriented just so.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.180
In a different orientation, it
would look murkier, look sort

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.940
of a bluish purple for the other
principal direction of

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.560
the birefringence.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:57.180
So there is putting crystal
anisotropy hundreds of years

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.390
ago to a very useful purpose
to navigate on cloudy days.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.810
Unfortunately, the Vikings
used it to sail down the

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.750
British coast and sacked
the next village.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.590
So it shows you that even the
most simple of science can be

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:16.460
put to application
in war research.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.300
Anyway, won't go
there anymore.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.870
So index of refraction and color
can also be a strong

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:32.040
function of direction

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:38.540
The numbers that I put on the
blackboard suggest that the

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.390
magnitude of thermal expansion
coefficients are influenced

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.060
very strongly by the strength
of the interatomic bonding.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.420
And this shows up in a very,
very striking way if you group

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:56.810
together classes of comparable
materials.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:01.190
And if you plot the value of the
linear thermal expansion

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:08.100
coefficient in units of 10 to
the minus 6 per degree C as a

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:14.510
function of the melting point in
degrees Kelvin, the numbers

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:20.390
range from about 400 K for
materials like sulfur up to

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.160
about 3,700 for tungsten.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.120
And the variation is
so beautiful it

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.690
could make you cry.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.330
It goes as the inverse
of the melting point.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:40.500
And way up here are materials
like for sulfur and lithium.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.420
And the way out here are
materials like tungsten.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:50.500
And their relation is given
by a equals 0.020 over the

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.950
melting point in
degrees Kelvin.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:02.420
So very strong correlation
between melting point and

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.510
linear expansion for
simple elements.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.790
If you do the same thing for
compounds, you find a similar

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:15.555
parabolic relation except
it is offset.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:33.190
For oxides and halides, many
of them with the rock salt

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.420
structure, so they
are isotropic.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.190
And again, if you plot here the
melting point in degrees

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:44.520
Kelvin, the numbers here
range up to 60 times 10

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.320
to the minus 6.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:53.110
And again, a variation
with 1 over T, but

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.030
offset from the origin.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:40:02.570
And the curve here is that a
equals 0.038 over T, the

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:09.280
melting point T sub m in Kelvin,
minus 7.0 times 10 to

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.530
the minus 6.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.690
Finally, let me finish with some
data for single crystals

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.200
that provide examples
of and anisotropy.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.130
These are all hexagonal
materials.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.680
And I will give you the--

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.600
not all hexagonal.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.230
I take that back.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.240
But they're all uniaxial
crystals.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.870
The value of the thermal
expansion coefficient along C

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.270
and the thermal expansion
coefficient that is parallel

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.100
to C, so these are the elements
that would be in the

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.850
diagonal isothermal
expansion tensor.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:41:00.240
So for Al2O3, which is a
hexagonal rhombohedral oxide,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:06.330
the two expansion coefficients
are 8.39 and 9.0 times 10 to

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.840
the minus 6, not terribly
anisotropic.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.550
But the structure of alumina is
a close-packed arrangement

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:18.890
of oxygen with aluminum filling
2/3 of the available

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.700
octahedral holes.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:26.460
So it's hexagonal only because
of the sites that are filled

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.490
in the array.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.540
For TiO2, which is [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:39.270
and therefore also uniaxial,
6.8 perpendicular to C; 8.3

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:49.730
parallel to C. For zirconium
silicate, 3.7 and 6.2, almost

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.500
a 2:1 difference.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:42:01.510
For the quartz form of silica,
which is hexagonal, 14

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:07.550
perpendicular to C;
9 parallel to C.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.700
For carbon, the graphite form,
a layer structure--

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.220
you can almost guess how this
is going to turn out.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.100
It's going to be humongous
perpendicular to the lawyers

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.660
and very small within the plane
of these tightly bonded

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.370
hexagonal nets.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:32.630
And that is indeed the case,
1 perpendicular to C; 27

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:38.090
parallel to C. So there is an
anisotropy of a factor of 27.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:41.480
A few more.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:55.220
Aluminum titanate, perpendicular
to C minus 2.6;

00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:01.636
parallel to C 11.5.

00:43:01.636 --> 00:43:06.180
A very well known example
of anisotropy, extreme

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.450
anisotropy, where one principal
coefficient is

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:14.840
positive and two are negative
is the calcite forms calcium

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:22.100
carbonate, minus 6 and 25.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.250
For zinc metal, a hexagonal
close-packed metal, surprising

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:30.930
degree of anisotropy,
14 and 64.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:37.210
And for tellurium, which is a
chain structure like selenium,

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:44.040
27 perpendicular to C and
minus 1.6 in a direction

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.640
parallel to C.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.080
Even simple hexagonal
close-packed metals can do

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.430
strange things at low
temperatures.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:57.200
For zinc, the expansion
coefficients perpendicular to

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:04.100
C and parallel to C as a
function of temperature go at

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.850
300 degrees C from 13 and 64.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:17.046
At 150, the values have
dropped to 8 and 65.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:26.230
At 60 degrees K perpendicular to
C, the thermal expansion is

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:30.080
negative and has not dropped
terribly much of at all

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.000
parallel to C. So this is
a hexagonal close-packed

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.730
structure lot.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.720
A lot of action and strange
things going on in the plane

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.290
at the close-packed layers, but
not very much change in a

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.140
direction perpendicular
to the layers.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.000
Let me raise one more issue.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.600
If we were to look at some of
these strangely anisotropic

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.220
materials which had negative
thermal expansion coefficients

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.720
in one direction and positive
in another, what would the

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.810
representation quadric
look like?

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:26.430
Suppose we looked at calcite,
for example, which has a large

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.120
negative thermal expansion
coefficient.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.630
And if we look at the thermal
expansion quadric when the

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.840
tensor was referred
to the principal

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:40.415
axes, parallel to C--

00:45:40.415 --> 00:45:47.220
well, the thermal expansion
tensor aij along its principal

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:53.470
axes would be along A1 in a
direction perpendicular to C,

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:59.520
it would be for the data given
here, minus 6, zero, zero,

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.850
zero, minus 6, zero,
zero, zero.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:08.135
And A33 is 25.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.100
So that's very, very
anisotropic.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.470
But what is this going to be?

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.640
This is going to be a quadric
that has the shape of an

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.160
hyperboloid of two sheets.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.330
So it's going to
look like this.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.650
And there'll be an asymptote
like this and then

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.145
asymptote like this.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.330
Along the asymptote,
the radius of

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.500
the quadric is infinite.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.300
So therefore along these
directions the

00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:00.670
strain is equal to zero.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:05.140
Strain goes as 1 over
the radius squared.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:15.350
In this range of directions
here, the radius is imaginary.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.680
But remember that the
strain is given by 1

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.220
over the radius squared.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:33.040
So this says that the strain is
negative, so the material

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.190
has contracted.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:41.710
And finally, in this range of
directions where the radius is

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:46.320
finite and positive, if the
value of strain is 1 over

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.270
radius squared, this says that
the maximum deformation is

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:54.380
along the direction of the C
axis, and it's positive.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.870
The material expands along C;
the minimum radius of the

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:02.540
quadric corresponds to the
maximum thermal expansion.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.980
So let me close with
a question.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:14.410
Along the asymptote of the
quadric, the strain is zero.

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:20.450
Does this mean that this
direction in a crystal of

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:24.730
calcite does not move, no
deformation at all when you

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:25.980
heat it up?

00:48:31.681 --> 00:48:33.669
I see faint shakes
of the head.

00:48:33.669 --> 00:48:37.148
I don't know if that's just in
awe of what's going on here or

00:48:37.148 --> 00:48:39.633
an opinion on the question.

00:48:39.633 --> 00:48:42.615
Do you think it'll
be no strain?

00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:45.100
AUDIENCE: It would
be [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.591
PROFESSOR: Good answer.

00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:51.780
Let's remember a property of
the representation quadric.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.650
The direction of what happens
is normal to the surface of

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.770
the quadric.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:01.420
The thing that is happening here
is the displacement; ui

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:06.440
is given by epsilon
ij times U sub j.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.260
So when we look in this
direction, the displacement,

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:16.010
which would be normal to the
surface of the quadric, gives

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:19.790
us this as a displacement.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.640
So along the asymptotes of the
quadric, you can't say that

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.730
there's no deformation, but
that the deformation

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.110
corresponds to pure rotation
and not any

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:34.260
fractional change of length.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.850
In these directions, the length
changes, but it is a

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:40.790
decrease in length within
the asymptotes.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:48.270
For those directions, the
strain is an extension.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.910
And again, if you want to know
the direction of the

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:54.810
displacement, you find the
normal to the surface of the

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.770
quadric in the direction of
interest, and that's the

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:01.040
direction in which the
radius vector points.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.040
All right.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.060
That's I think a good
place to quit.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:21.460
I think I'll say a little bit
more after the break about the

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.940
atomistic reason for increases
in interionic separations,

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.140
which we can get some insight
into from a simple model.

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:34.150
But before we disperse, I don't
know if everybody got a

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:38.230
copy of problem set 13.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:41.200
If anybody didn't, there's some
extra copies up here.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.640
But I will with great pleasure
pass out to you problems set

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.730
number 14, which has served
two purposes.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:52.780
One is to have you show for
yourself that the trace of a

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.620
second-rank tensor--

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.210
I called it second-order
tensor--

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:01.880
second-rank tensor the sum of
the diagonal elements is

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.440
invariant for a change of
reference axes for a general

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.700
direction cosine scheme for
the change of axes.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.510
And then the other two questions
are to give you some

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:17.490
practice in diagonalizing a
second-rank property tensor

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.920
which is not in diagonal form.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.920
And I asked you to do
this in two ways.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.160
One is by direct solution of
the secular equation and

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.000
finding the eigenvectors.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.660
And then the third example,
which is for a completely

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.990
general tensor, to do this by
the method of successive

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.580
approximations.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.240
And you'll find after a couple
of iterations you get fairly

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.630
close to convergence.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.480
So I shall pass this around.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.470
And again, I think there's
something to be

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.720
learned from that.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:53.340
Let's take our stretch then.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:01.936
I'm sure that lecture involved
a lot of stress and strain.

00:52:01.936 --> 00:52:04.880
Ha, ha.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.340
Let's resume in 10 minutes.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:12.590
And we'll then move on to some
additional higher rank tensor

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.150
properties, which will be
very, very interesting.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.400
Go for it.
